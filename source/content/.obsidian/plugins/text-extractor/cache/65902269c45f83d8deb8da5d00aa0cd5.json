Fit the two linear regions of the data separately and plot the data points along with the two ﬁt lines. 4) In the Debye model, the speciﬁc heat (in ∗ ) of a material at low temperature is given by 𝐶= 322.77 , where 𝑇 is the Debye temperature of the material. Measurements from a speciﬁc heat experiment of silicon are given in the included data ﬁle, “DebyeDat.txt”. Fit the given data to this model to determine 𝑇 and graph the best ﬁt line with the data included. 5) Write a python code to generate a set of uniformly distributed random points {𝑥,𝑦} where x and y are both in the range from [−1,1]. Using approximately 10 points, approximate 𝜋 by determining the rao of points which fall within the circle to the total number of points.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
