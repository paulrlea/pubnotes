Are solutions for the particle in a box problem. a) Find the A values that normalize the functions by performing the integral of the probability density. b) Find the expectation value for x for each function. (Write down any integrals one would need to calculate. You may not need to do any integrals if you make a good logical argument. Hint: Making a variable substitution can help you to visualize whether functions are even or odd about the center of the region.) c) Is the expectation value for each function equal to the most probable value for each function? If not, explain. d) Find the expectation value of x2 for each function. (You’ll have to do the integrals here.) e) Find the uncertainty in position (Δ𝑥 ≡ √〈𝑥2〉 − 〈𝑥〉2) for each function. 20) a) Find the state function in the wavevector representation, 𝐴(𝑘), for the wavefunction Ψ1(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴1 cos ( 𝜋𝑥 𝐿 ) 𝑒−𝜔1𝑡 where the wave function is zero for x<-L/2 and x>L/2 (outside the box). b) Find the uncertainty in 𝑘 by completing appropriate integrals. c) Make an argument for why your calculated uncertainty in k is reasonable.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
