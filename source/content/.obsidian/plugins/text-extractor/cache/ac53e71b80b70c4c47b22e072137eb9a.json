In order to study lowest-order quantum corrections to classical non-interacting systems ( 1 3 <<      V N λ ), it is sufficient to consider only the trivial permutation (“no permutation”) and two-particle permutations in the above expression, i.e.,       +±= ∑ < −  ji ijNN H N rf N e )(1 ! 1 2 32121 λ β xxxxxx where jiijr xx −= , and the ± sign are for Bosons/Fermions ).

(a) Obtain the energy E as a function of T ,V , N , and the equation of state up to first order in V N 3λ . Note that after using the small z approximation for )(zf ± ν , z must be eliminated from the equations in favor of V N 3λ . To this end you should use the first equation above for N . How do your final results compare with those of Problem 1.(a) and (b)? (b) Using ),,( NVTE , obtain the specific heat of the quantum gas up to the same order in V N 3λ . 4. Consider He gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and determine whether the classical approximation for the equation of state ( )NkTPV = is justified or not. Repeat the above considerations for the electron “gas” at room temperature.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
