Phasors rotate in the counterclockwise direction with angular speed 𝜔 2. The length of each phasor is proportional to the ac quantity amplitude 3. The projection of the phasor on the horizontal axis gives the instantaneous value of the ac quantity.

This allows us to rapidly determine how much of the complex number is “in-phase” and “out-of-phase” with the driving signal. To do this, multiply top and bottom by the complex conjugate of the bottom. 𝑎 + 𝑗𝑏 𝑐 + 𝑗𝑑 𝑐 − 𝑗𝑑 𝑐 − 𝑗𝑑 = (𝑎𝑐 + 𝑏𝑑) + 𝑗(−𝑎𝑑 + 𝑏𝑐) 𝑐2 + 𝑑2 = 𝑎𝑐 + 𝑏𝑑 𝑐2 + 𝑑2 + 𝑗 −𝑎𝑑 + 𝑏𝑐 𝑐2 + 𝑑2 8 Manipulating complex ratios (2) It is also useful to find the magnitude of a complex ratio. To do this, multiply by the complex conjugate and take the square root. 𝐴 = 𝑎 + 𝑗𝑏 𝑐 + 𝑗𝑑 𝐴 = 𝐴𝐴∗ = 𝑎 + 𝑗𝑏 𝑐 + 𝑗𝑑 𝑎 − 𝑗𝑏 𝑐 − 𝑗𝑑 = 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 𝑐2 + 𝑑2","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
