Such a collection of systems is called an ensemble. • To perform an ensemble measurement of an observable, we perform precisely the same measurement on the members of an ensemble of identical systems. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 4 Normalized Probability The probability of a specific outcome is the number of times that it occurs, divided by the total number of experiments: 𝑃(𝑎) = 𝑛𝑎 𝑁 The probability of a set of outcomes is the sum of the probabilities of each outcome: 𝑃(𝑎 or 𝑏 or ...) = ෍ 𝑗=𝑎 𝑐 𝑃(𝑗) = 1 𝑁 ෍ 𝑗=𝑎 𝑐 𝑛𝑗 By this definition, all possible outcomes must have a total probability of one ෍ 𝑗=𝑎 𝑃(𝑗) = 1 Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 5 Ensemble Averages • Given the probabilities for a set of outcomes, we can find useful quantities, like the average* (or expectation value) of a result q, through a simple sum: \"mean of q\"= 𝑞 = ǉ𝑞 = σ𝑗=1 𝑀 𝑞𝑗𝑃(𝑞𝑗) σ𝑗=1 𝑀 𝑃(𝑞𝑗) • Another statistic that is useful in describing distributions is the dispersion or variance: variance=dispersion= 𝑞 − 𝑞 2 *Physics words: average=mean=expectation value Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 6 Continuous distributions • In many physical cases, the result of a measurement can be any value within a physical range, for example, the position of a particle. • We can define the probability of finding the particle within a certain infinitesimal range as P(x)dx and we call P(x) the probability density. • Given a probability density, we can compute the expectation value of any parameter q(x). 𝑥 = න −∞ ∞ 𝑥𝑃(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 𝑞(𝑥) = න −∞ ∞ 𝑞(𝑥)𝑃(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 7 Matter waves • Just adding probability distributions does not give interference. • In order to get an interference pattern, we must be able to superpose two waves. • A working hypothesis: – Observations occur in proportion to the probability that a particle will be in a state (r(t), p(t), E(t)) when it is measured. – The probability is proportional to the square of a wave amplitude. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 8 The State Function • Every physically realizable state of a system is described in quantum mechanics by a state function  that contains all accessible information about the system in that state. – The phrase “wave function” is usually used to mean a state function that is specified as a function of position and time (x,t). Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 9 Born’s Postulate If, at time t, a measurement is made to locate the particle associated with the wavefunction Ψ( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡), then the probability 𝑃( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡)𝑑𝑣 that the particle will be found in the volume 𝑑𝑣 around position Ԧ𝑟 is equal to 𝑷(𝒓, 𝒕)𝒅𝒗 = 𝜳∗ 𝒓, 𝒕 𝜳 𝒓, 𝒕 𝒅𝒗. Where Ψ∗( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡) denotes the complex conjugate of Ψ( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡). Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 10 Principle of Superposition If Ψ1 and Ψ2 represent two physically realizable states of a system, then the linear combination Ψ = 𝑐1Ψ1 + 𝑐2Ψ2 is also a physically realizable state of the system. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 11 Normalization • Sometimes you will be given wave functions that lead to an integrated probability that is not already 1. (or that have an unspecified multiplicative constant.) • Before you try to do any calculation with a wavefunction, you should decide whether it needs to be normalized so that the integrated probability is 1. Given an un−normalized wavefunction Ψ′ such that න −∞ ∞ Ψ′ ∗ ( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡)Ψ′( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡)𝑑𝑣 = 𝑀 just multiply Ψ′ by the constant 1 M to create a new function: Ψ(x,t) = Ψ′(x,t) 𝑀 that will be normalized. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 12 A quick peek at the Schrodinger Equation Later, we will deduce and solve the wave equation for matter waves (The Schrodinger Equation). Here I will show it to you, make some simplifying assumptions, and discuss the nature of the solutions. Here it is, in one dimension, − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉(𝑥) Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝑖ℏ 𝜕Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) 𝜕𝑡 and in 3: − ℏ2 2𝑚 ∇ 2 + 𝑉 Ԧ𝑟 Ψ( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡) = 𝑖ℏ 𝜕Ψ( Ԧ𝑟,𝑡) 𝜕𝑡 Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 13 Physical constraints on wavefunctions • A physical wavefunction must be normalizable. (The particle must be somewhere.) • A physical wavefunction must be single valued. (It can’t have two probabilities of being at the same point.) • A physical wavefunction and its spatial derivatives must be continuous. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 14 Examples of allowed and disallowed wavefunctions (from Morrison) Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 15 Expectation value • In quantum mechanics, the ensemble average of an observable for a particular state of the system is called the expectation value of that observable. 𝑄 = ׬−∞ ∞ Ψ∗𝑄Ψ𝑑𝑣 ׬−∞ ∞ Ψ∗Ψ𝑑𝑣 • The uncertainty in the observable is the square root of the variance Δ𝑄 = 𝑄 − 𝑄 2 1/2 = 𝑄2 − 𝑄 2 1/2 Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 16 Einstein-de Broglie relations 𝐸 = ℎ𝑓 = ℏ𝜔 and 𝑝 = ℎ 𝜆 = ℏ𝑘 As we continue to analyze behavior of wavefunctions it is useful for us to keep in mind two basic relations for matter waves, relating particle properites to wave properties: Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 17 Free space solution for  For V(x)=0, we can illustrate some physical points by working through the wave function logic of this physical situation without fully solving the differential equation. A. If  is to be normalizable, it must go to zero as r→infinity. B.  must be complex, because the right side of the SE has an inescapable i in it. C.  must not violate the homogeneity of free space. (The probability must be the same after we translate  by an arbitrary distance.) Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 18 Three trial functions 1) Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴 cos( 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡 + 𝜀) :a real harmonic wave 2) Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴𝑒𝑖(𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡) :a complex harmonic wave 3.) A complex wavepacket A.  normalizable? B.  complex? C.  must not violate the homogeneity of free space. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 19 Test the harmonic function Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴 cos( 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡 + 𝜀) :a real harmonic wave A. Normalizable? No, unless 𝐴 goes to zero. B.) Complex? No. Unlikely to satisfy the wave equation. C.) Homogeneous 𝑃? No. 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑡) = Ψ∗(𝑥, 𝑡) Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴2 cos2( 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡 + 𝜀) 𝑃(𝑥 + 𝑎, 𝑡) = Ψ∗(𝑥 + 𝑎, 𝑡) Ψ(𝑥 + 𝑎, 𝑡) Ψ(𝑥 + 𝑎, 𝑡) = 𝐴 cos( 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡) cos 𝑘 𝑎 + sin( 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡) sin 𝑘 𝑎 𝑃(𝑥 + 𝑎, 𝑡) = 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑡) cos2 𝑘 𝑎 + +𝐴 2 sin 2( 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡) sin 2 𝑘 𝑎 + 2 cos 𝑘 𝑎 sin 𝑘 𝑎 cos( 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡) sin( 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡) ≠ 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑡) Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 20 Test the complex harmonic function Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴𝑒𝑖(𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡) A. Normalizable? Only if 𝐴 goes to zero. නP(x,t)dx = න𝐴𝑒−𝑖(𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡)𝐴𝑒𝑖(𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡)𝑑𝑥 = න −∞ ∞ 𝐴𝑑𝑥 = 𝐴 2∞ B.) Complex? Yes. It is indeed a solution to C.) Homogeneous 𝑃? Yes. 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑡) = Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡)∗Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴 2 (independent of position) We seem to be on the right track. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 21 The complex wave packet We can construct a localized/normalizable wavepacket out of complex harmonic waves using the Fourier transform: Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 1 2𝜋 ׬−∞ ∞ 𝐴(𝑘)𝑒𝑖(𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡)𝑑𝑘 where 𝐴(𝑘) = 1 2𝜋 ׬−∞ ∞ Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡)𝑒−𝑖(𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡)𝑑𝑘 ⇒ Because this wavefunction can be localized, it is likely to be normalizable. (We will need to test specific cases.) ⇒ Because each term in it is a solution to the wave equation, the wave function must also be a solution. ⇒ Is the shape of the probability of the sum of complex harmonics translation invariant? 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑡) = ෤𝑎𝑒𝑖𝑘1𝑥 + ෨𝑏𝑒𝑖𝑘2𝑥 ∗ ෤𝑎𝑒𝑖𝑘1𝑥 + ෨𝑏𝑒𝑖𝑘2𝑥 = ෤𝑎∗𝑒−𝑖𝑘1𝑥 + ෨𝑏∗𝑒−𝑖𝑘2𝑥 ෤𝑎𝑒𝑖𝑘1𝑥 + ෨𝑏𝑒𝑖𝑘2𝑥 = 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 + ෤𝑎∗ ෨𝑏𝑒−𝑖(𝑘1−𝑘2)𝑥 + ෨𝑏∗ ෤𝑎𝑒𝑖(𝑘1−𝑘2)𝑥 = 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 + ෤𝑎∗ ෨𝑏𝑒−𝑖𝑘′𝑥 + ෨𝑏∗ ෤𝑎𝑒𝑖𝑘′𝑥 𝑃(𝑥 + 𝛼, 𝑡) = 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 + ෤𝑎∗𝑒−𝑖𝑘1𝑥−𝑖𝑘1𝛼 ෨𝑏𝑒𝑖𝑘2𝑥+𝑖𝑘2𝛼 + ෨𝑏∗𝑒−𝑖𝑘2𝑥−𝑖𝑘2𝛼 ෤𝑎𝑒𝑖𝑘1𝑥+𝑖𝑘1𝛼 = 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 + ෤𝑎∗ ෨𝑏𝑒−𝑖𝑘′(𝑥+𝛼) + ෨𝑏∗ ෤𝑎𝑒𝑖𝑘′(𝑥+𝛼) This function is just the old one, moved over. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 22 In-class exercise 1 1. Is this function physically admissible? Why or why not? 2. Where is the particle most likely to be found? 3.

Justify. •Morrison 3.1 p. 89 This is a normalized state function at t=0. The magnitude of (x,0) continues to decay smoothly to zero as x→. Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 23 In-class discussion and questions 2 • Morrison 3.3 p. 90 Quantum Physics - Spring 2024 - Class 3 24 Summary: (In which I try to clarify what we are doing) • From evidence of interference in “particle” experiments, we introduced the idea that matter must be described by some sort of wave. – De Broglie-Einstein relations: p=h/ ; E=hf • The wave is not directly observable, but the resulting probability of various outcomes is, hence we introduced a probability interpretation of quantum physics experiments. • We then assumed that there existed a wave that could yield the correct observables, with classical relations between time, energy, momentum, and position. The ramifications were then explored. – The probability of an outcome is proportional to the square of the wavefunction for that outcome. – The probability interpretation leads to the ability to compute the expectation (average) value and variance for appropriate observables once the wave function is known. – The superposition of waves to form a packet leads to a mathematical statement of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. – We could deduce the form of a useful wave equation for matter waves. • We will next explore some examples of wave functions and their observable ramifications. – Wavepackets, momentum-position transforms – More general state functions – the momentum state","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
