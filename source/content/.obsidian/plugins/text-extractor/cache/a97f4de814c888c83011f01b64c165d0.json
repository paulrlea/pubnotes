In this section I ﬁrst address optical transitions using a relatively simple classical analogy to estimate transition rate and lifetimes. I then outline a quantum mechanical approach that leads to an understanding of the origins and meaning optical selection rules. The quantum mechanical approach uses time-dependent perturbation theory, which is above the normal expectations for this course, but worth- while as a ﬁrst exposure. You will not be expected to reproduce this theory, but rather to understand the logical argument and its consequences. 1.1 A classical analogy that works pretty well Classical charge distributions radiate only when there is accelerating charge. (Pure eigenstates do not radiate - the charge distribution (probability den- sity) does not change with time.) Quantum mechanically, the wave function sloshes with time (acceleration) if two states are mixed. We will address the details in the quantum mechanical part of this chapter. For now, let’s just assume that sloshing occurs and that the dipole moment has the form −→p = q−→ d cos(ωt) where d is ≈ size of the atom. An oscillating electric dipole is the closest analogy to sloshing of a mixed 1This chapter is intended to follow Chapter 6 and precede section 7.3 in Townsend. 1 2 CHAPTER 1. ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSITIONS Figure 1.1: A schematic of the radiated ﬁeld strength as a function of angle for an oscillating dipole oriented vertically. state. Radiation from an oscillating dipole is treated in intermediate electro- magnetics texts2. I provide an outline of the argument here. Consider a large spherical shell with very small 3 charge distribution at its center. The total power passing through a spherical surface is the integral of the Poynting vector over this surface: P (r) = ∮ −→ S · d−→a = 1 µ0 ∮ (−→ E × −→ B ) · d−→a . Since the electric ﬁeld from a static dipole falls oﬀ as 1/r3 and the mag- netic ﬁeld of a moving charge falls oﬀ as 1/r2 the power passing though a surface at very large r is negligible compared to the radiating ﬁeld of the accelerating charges. First let’s consider the ﬁeld from a single charge q near the origin with acceleration a. To solve for the radiating ﬁelds, one writes the potentials V (−→r , t) and −→ A (−→r , t) and takes appropriate derivatives, and for d << 2πc/ω << r the predominant electric ﬁeld is transverse to the radius from the dipole and is approximately given by the relation: Eperp = qa 4πϵ0c2r sinθ where a is the acceleration of the charge and θ is the angle from the axis of the dipole. The magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld is given by E/c and the magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld. These electric and magnetic ﬁelds propagate radially outward at the speed of light, with 2e.g.- Griﬃths, Introduction to Electrodynamics, Chapter 11. 3This means that the distance d between the charges of the dipole is small compared to the distance r at which the observation is made and the wavelength 2πc/ω of the emitted radiation (or d << 2πc/ω << r), which is easy to satisfy for optical radiation from an atom. 1.1. A CLASSICAL ANALOGY THAT WORKS PRETTY WELL 3 the Poynting vector magnitude given by: S = ϵ0cE2 . Therefore S = q2a2 16π2ϵ0c3r2 sin2θ . The total radiated power R is found by integrating over all angles R = 1 4πϵ0 2 3 q2a2 c3 If we now consider the radiation from an electron wavefunction oscillating on a nearly stationary proton so that the average position of the electron charge oscillates as x = Asinωt so that a = −Aω2sinωt and R = 1 4πϵ0 2 3 q2x2ω4 c3 and the average radiation rate is therefore: ⟨R⟩ = 1 6πϵ0 q2x2ω4 c3 = 1 12πϵ0c3 q2A2ω4. (1.1) If we assume that the instantaneous dipole moment of an electron wavefunc- tion is p = qx then the average power emitted is can also be written: ⟨R⟩ = p2ω4 12πϵ0c3 . Exercise P1.01: a) Assuming that the frequency of oscillation is due to the diﬀerence in energy between the 2p and 1s states of the H atom, and that the amplitude of oscillation is about one Bohr radius, estimate the rate at which energy is classically radiated in eV/s. b) Estimate the classical time it takes for this atom to radiate the energy diﬀer- ence between these two states. a aActual atomic lifetimes for allowed transitions are of order 10-100 ns. This argument can be made slightly more ”quantum mechanical” by ex- plicitly calculating the time dependent dipole moment for an equal mixture 4 CHAPTER 1. ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSITIONS of two states (initial and ﬁnal). (We will justify this assumption in the next section on time-dependent perturbation theory.) Our mixed state is: Ψ = ψ1exp(−iE1t/¯h) + ψ2exp(−iE1t/¯h) . So the instantaneous expectation value of the dipole moment is: ⟨p⟩ = −q ∫ Ψ ∗−→r Ψd−→r . Ψ ∗Ψ = ψ∗ 1ψ1 + ψ∗ 2ψ2 + ψ∗ 1ψ2e (−i(E1−E2)/¯h) + ψ∗ 2ψ1e(i(E1−E2)/¯h) and for real space wavefunctions: Ψ ∗Ψ = Ψ∗Ψ = ψ2 1 + ψ2 2 + 2ψ1ψ2cos((E1 − E2)t/¯h). Notice that the only remaining time dependence is in the overlap term, so that’s where the ”sloshing” comes from. Exercise P1.02: Calculate the rate of change of the dipole moment for a mixture of the n=1 and n=2 states of an electron in a one-dimensional box of length 1 nm. 1.2 Time-dependent Perturbation theory Although the classical estimation above gives the order of magnitude of the power emitted, it does not tell us whether a transition will actually occur. It is necessary to resort to time dependent perturbation theory to do this. 4 This is a topic you will take up with more rigor in a Quantum Mechanics course. I will outline the argument here and discuss the ramiﬁcations of components of the argument. The perturbation in this case is an oscillating electromagnetic ﬁeld, which could have background blackbody radiation as its origin. We assume an electric ﬁeld polarized along the x axis E(t) = Epcos(ωt) which yields a local perturbing potential of vp(x, t) = E0xcos(ωt). We assume that the eﬀect of this potential on the atomic wavefunctions is small. The key idea in perturbation theory is that we can fruitfully express 4The source for my notes here is Chapter 10 of the text, Introduction to Modern Physics by McGervey. 1.2. TIME-DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY 5 the new solutions to the perturbed Hamiltonian H = H0 + vp in terms of the solutions to the unperturbed Hamiltonian.5 The old, unperturbed eigenfunctions are found from: H0ψl = Elψl and where ψl(x, t) = ul(x)e −iElt/¯h. Since we are interested in time-dependent eﬀects, let’s start with the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the perturbed Hamiltonian:6 (H0 + vp(x, t))χn = i¯h∂χn ∂t The ψl form a complete orthonormal set of solutions, so we can also write the new wavefunctions χn as the sum of the ψl’s: χn = ∑ l anl(t)ψl. And substituting this form for the perturbed states into the time-dependent Schrodinger equation: (H0 + vp(x, t)) ∑ l anl(t)ψl = i¯h∂∑ l anl(t)ψl ∂t Taking the derivative on the right and distributing the operators on the left: ∗H0 ∑ l anl(t)ψl + vp(x, t) ∑ l anl(t)ψl = i¯h( ∑ l ψl ∂anl(t) ∂t + anl ∂ψl ∂t ).∗ Since the operator H0 does not operate on time and anl(t) is only a function of time, and only working on the leftmost term: H0 ∑ l anl(t)ψl = ∑ l anl(t)H0ψl = i¯h ∑ l anl ∂ψl ∂t . This means that the leftmost term in the asterisked equation above can be canceled with the rightmost term, leaving: vp(x, t) ∑ l anl(t)ψl = i¯h( ∑ l ψl ∂anl(t) ∂t ) 5We can always express the new wavefunctions in terms of the old ones because the old ones form a complete set, but would like to be able to express the new ones in terms of just a few old ones. 6We’ll make all of these arguments in one dimension because the logic is the same as for three, but the math is simpler. 6 CHAPTER 1. ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSITIONS We can eliminate the sum using a standard expansion trick: by multiplying both sides by ψ∗ n′, ψ∗ n′vp(x, t) ∑ l anl(t)ψl = i¯h( ∑ l ψ∗ n′ ∂anl(t) ∂t ψl) and integrating over space to select one term (remember the ψl are orthonor- mal and anl is independent of position) ∑ l anl(t)[ ∫ ψ∗ n′vp(x, t)ψldV ] = i¯h∂ann′(t) ∂t Remember that ann′ is the coeﬃcient that tells us how much of the n′th orig- inal eigenfunction ψn′ makes up the χn state of the perturbed wavefunction. a2 nn′ therefore tells us the probability that we ﬁnd the system in state ψn′ with energy En′ given that it is in state χn. If we assume that the perturbed states are very similar to the unperturbed states, then the ψn′ state has nearly unity overlap with the χn state and if the system is in ψn′ immediately prior to application of the ﬁeld, then it will be in ψn′ immediately after the ﬁeld is applied. Therefore for short times anl ≈ 1 for l=n’ and all other anl terms are nearly zero, thus: i¯h∂ann′(t) ∂t = ∫ ψ∗ n′vp(x, t)ψldV. (1.2) In words, the rate at which the coeﬃcient of the ψn state transitions to the ψn′ state is proportional to an integral of the product of the two wavefunctions and the perturbing potential. i¯h∆ann′(t) = i¯h ∫ ∂ann′(t) ≈ ∫ t 0 ∫ space ψ∗ n′vp(x, t ′)ψldV ∂t ′. We can make the integrals more physically meaningful by remembering that the original wavefunctions are products of space and time components, ψl(x, t) = ul(x)e −iElt/¯h. Making this substitution yields: ∆amn(t) = 1 i¯h ∫ t 0 e iωnn′ tvmn∂t′ where ¯hωnn′ = (En′ − En) and vnn′ = ∫ u ∗ n′vp(x, t)uldV is called the spatial matrix element for the transition between un′ and un with the perturbation vp.7 7We are almost there! 1.2. TIME-DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY 7 Now we can use the appropriate potential for electromagnetic wave per- turbation, vp = qxE0cos(ωt) = qxE0(e iωt + e −iωt)/2 which produces a ”simple” expression for the probability of ﬁnding a system that was in state ψn at t = 0 in a new state ψm for a perturbing ﬁeld along the x-direction: ∆ann′ = iqE0 2¯h xnn′ ∫ t 0 [e i(ωnn′ −ω)t′ + ei(ωnn′ +ω)t′]dt ′. where xnn′ = ∫ u ∗ n′xundV. 8 1.2.1 Energy-Time Relationship First we address the consequences of the time integral. Later we will address the space integral. Integrating in time with the assumption that the pulse starts at time zero and continues for a short time t: 9 ∆ann′ = iqE0 2¯h vnn′[1 − ei(ωnn′ −ω)t (ωnn′ − ω) + 1 − e i(ωnn′ +ω)t (ωnn′ + ω) ] The probability the a system that starts in state ψ′ n will be found in state ψn a short time t later is ∆a2 nn′, so: |∆ann′| 2 = q2E2 0 |xnn′| 2t 2 sin 2(βt) (βt)2 (1.3) where β = (ωn′ − ωn − ω)/2 for a transition in one direction and β = (ωn′ − ωn + ω)/2 for a transition in the other. (A perturbing EM wave can induce a transition upward (absorption of a photon) or downward (emission)). All of this math so far leads to the following observations with respect to the time and frequency dependence of the probability of induced transition: • A transition is most probable when the perturbing EM wave has a frequency equal to the energy diﬀerence between the initial and ﬁnal states divided by ¯h. 8For ﬁeld along the y-axis the spatial integral is xnn′ = ∫ u ∗ n′yundV. 9By short time t, we mean that the probability of transition in time t is much less than 1. 8 CHAPTER 1. ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSITIONS Figure 1.2: Spectral response for an atomic transition due to a pulse of frequency ω • The probability that a transition occurs increases with ﬁeld amplitude and with time. • Transitions can be induced either upwards or downwards. The stim- ulation of a downwards transition by a perturbing EM wave is called stimulated emission • The width of the peak in the transition probability depends on the length of time that the perturbation is applied. This relationship be- tween the width of the peak in frequency and the time of the pulse, is another way of expressing the Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle. • The probability of transition is proportional to the square of the spatial integral xnm. Energy-Lifetime Fourier Transform The state |Ψ⟩ can be expressed in terms of its time dependence Ψ(t) or its frequency spectrum A(ω) where the two representations are related by a Fourier transform pair: Ψ(t) = 1 √2π ∫ A(ω)e −iωtdω and A(ω) = 1 √ 2π ∫ Ψ(t)eiωt So the time dependence of the probability that an atom is in a given state determines the probability that a photon of a particular frequency is emitted. When we say that an atom has a particular lifetime τ in an excited state we mean that the average rate of emission of photons from a large number of atoms corresponds to an average lifetime of τ . The actual time of emission for any individual atom is not known. If the lifetime is τ and the number of excited atoms at t = 0 is N0, then the number of atoms remaining after time t is N (t) = N0e −t/τ . 1.2. TIME-DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY 9 Figure 1.3: Breit-Wigner lineshape for a center frequency of 10 units and a lifetime of 1 unit −1 Figure 1.4: This exponential decay law applies to any random decay process. N (t) N0 = ∫ ∞ t Ψ ∗Ψdt is the probability that an atom has survived to time t, so Ψ∗Ψ = e−t/τ τ . We can therefore infer that |Ψ(t)| ∝ e−t/2τ . (1.4) If the energy of the excited state is E0, then the time-dependence of the wavefunction is given by: Ψ(t) ∝ e−t/2τ eiω0t where ω0 = E0/¯h. The energy spectrum |A(ω)| 2 of emitted photons can be found from the Fourier transform of Ψ(t) which yields the Breit-Wigner line shape: |A(ω)| 2 ∝ 1 (ω − ω0)2 + (1/2τ )2 (1.5) Exercise P1.03: Show that the Fourier transform of equation 1.4 leads to the Breit-Wigner spectrum of equation 1.5. 10 CHAPTER 1. ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSITIONS 1.2.2 The Spatial Matrix Element: Selection Rules The transition probability above still has the xnn′ = ∫ u∗ n′xundV (1.6) term, which is a spatial integral. Now we will consider the ramiﬁcations of this term. Parity The symmetry properties of the wavefunction can frequently be used to quickly determine whether a dipole matrix element is zero or not. The parity of a wavefunction is determined by how it transforms when the sign of the spatial coordinates is changed. 10 Πψ(x, y, z) = ψ(−x, −y, −z) with the eigenvalue equation: Πψλ(x, y, z) = λψlambda(x, y, z) so that an eigenfunction corresponding to λ = +1 is even and corresponding to λ = −1 is odd. The dipole matrix element involves multiplication of the wavefunctions by x, y or z, which are odd functions. If the initial and ﬁnal wavefunctions are both even or both odd, then the integral will be zero, because the product of two functions of the same parity is always even and integration of an odd function over symmetric limits is zero. The conclusion is that a dipole transition is forbidden if initial and ﬁnal states do not have diﬀerent parity. Atomic transitions The wavefunctions for atoms are usually expressed in spherical coordinates, so we’ll convert the operator x = rsinθcosφ and dV = rsinθdrdθdφ so xnn′ = ∫ π 0 dφ ∫ ∞ 0 dr ∫ 2π 0 dθu∗ munr2sin2θ cos φ. If the spatial integral is zero, then the transition is said to be ”forbidden”. This does not actually mean that the transition can not occur, remember that we used ﬁrst order perturbation approximations to get to this point. There 10See Townsend section 5.1 pp. 153 ﬀ. 1.2. TIME-DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY 11 are higher order corrections as well as higher order multipole electromagnetic interactions that might permit the transition, but the transition rate will be much lower. For any spherically symmetric potential, the angular solutions to the Schrodinger equation are the spherical harmonics Yl,m(θ, φ) = Φ(φ)P |m| l (θ). 11 Magnetic Quantum Number Consider the φ integral ﬁrst. For spherical harmonics, Φ(φ) ∝ e imφ where m is an integer. For electric ﬁeld along the x axis, we therefore want to evaluate ∫ 2π 0 e −im′φcosφe−imφdφ = 2 ∫ 2π 0 e −im′φ(eiφ + e −iφ])e imφdφ This integral will only be non-zero if m′ −m = ±1. This is our ﬁrst ”selection rule” for optical transitions. In words, the change in magnetic quantum num- ber for electric ﬁeld polarized along the x-axis, m, can only be of magnitude one. We must also consider the possibility that the perturbing ﬁeld is oriented along the z-axis. In this case z = rcosθ and therefore ∫ 2π 0 e−im′φze −imφdφ = ∫ 2π 0 e −im′φrcosθe−imφdφ = rcosθ ∫ 2π 0 e−im′φe−imφdφ. Which is non-zero only if m′ − m = 0. In summary, the transition probability can only be non-zero if m ′ − m = 0 or ±1, depending on polarization. Angular Momentum The θ integral is of the form: ∫ 2π 0 u∗ munsin2θdθ. For spherical potentials the θ portion of the spatial matrix element involves integration of associated Legendre polynomials. 12 The math is not too bad, but the arithmetic for a general proof is more involved than I want to go into in this course. To summarize the conclusion: If P |m| l (cosθ) represents the initial state and P |m|′ l′ (cosθ) represents the ﬁnal state, then the integral on θ vanishes unless l − l′ = ±1. Note that this selection rule 11See section 6.2 in Townsend, esp. p.183. 12See Appendix B in Townsend. 12 CHAPTER 1. ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSITIONS is just a special case of the parity selection rule, because the parity of an associated Legendre function is even for l=even and odd if l is odd. Exercise P1.04: Show that the θ integral is zero for a dipole transition between a Y0,0 state and a Y2,0 state.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
