Multipole expansion is useful for e.g. molecular physics (e.g. long range molecular forces). The method is used to describe electric potentials (potential energies U(r)=qV(r)) originating from electric charge distributions within atoms & molecules. Conceptually, potential energies U(r) are inserted into the Schroedinger equation HY=[(p2/2m)+U(r)]Y=EY. Calculated energy levels are compared to experimental observation (spectra). Basic (electrostatic) models of molecules can be constructed from e.g. point charges: Atomic physics H+: CO: r binominal series. =V0+V1+V2+V3+…. r The First Three Terms of the Multipole Expansion Good to remember: a is angle between r and r’ , i.e. r·r’ = r r’ cosa. However, sometimes the geometry of the problem permits to orient r or r’ along z-axis, then a=q with q the spherical coordinate.
