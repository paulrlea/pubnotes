Silicon – material of choice: + abundant + high-quality but also: - not luminescent - costly to purify and handle - not ideal for large-area applicationsPHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo Properties of organic electronics advantages: - solution processing - price (low temp & pressure) - substrate choice (flexibility) - area size - printing (roll-to-roll) - biocompatibility - molecular design disadvantages: - slower than silicon - sensitive to water, UV, oxygen...PHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo Example materials polymersmolecular Dr Monika Szumilo Already available: • Rollable TVs: https://www.lg.com/global/lg-signature/rollable-oled-tv-r • Flexible, compostable PVs • Retinal chips • Smart fabrics • … Images: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Foldable-and- photovoltaic-wide-field-retinal-prosthesis-a-3D-model-of- the-fabricated_fig1_323641091 https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/saithome/research/organic. do Semiconductivity of organic materials How can polymers and molecules become semiconductive?PHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo Hybridisation Basic state 2s 2pEnergy2pz sp3sp2 sp hybridisation sp2 hybridisation sp3 hybridisation sp 2p Excited statePHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo sp2 hybridisation 2pz sp2 sp2 hybridisationPHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo Bonding between C atoms σ-bonds: - overlap of hybridised orbitals - along the chain - strong - highly directional - forms stable carbon structures π-bonds: - overlap of 2pz orbitals - weak - restricts rotation (planarise) - forms stable carbon structures - delocalised in conjugated moleculesPHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo Conjugation delocalisation of π/π*- states over many carbon atoms CONJUGATIONPHAS0058, Lecture 1 Dr Monika Szumilo π-bonding conjugation = delocalisation of π/ π* orbitals over many carbon atoms conjugation lengthPHAS0058, Lecture 1 Dr Monika Szumilo HOMO/LUMO LUMO – lowest unoccupied molecular orbital HOMO – highest occupied molecular orbital Image from Optoelectronics group at Cavendish Laboratory conjugation length alternating single and double bonds usually indicate conjugationPHAS0058, Lecture 1 Dr Monika Szumilo π-π stacking overlap of π orbitals of neighbouring molecules delocalization • efficient charge transport • lower optical bandgapPHAS0058, Lecture 1 Dr Monika Szumilo Structure vs. conjugation length - more planar molecules have lower energy gap (longer conjugation length) - planarity may be affected by: - chemical defects - topological defects - interaction between molecules (e.g. sidechains) The size of the bandgap depends on both the number of monomers n and the effective conjugation length PolaronsPHAS0058, Lecture 1 Dr Monika Szumilo Peierl’s transition (aka. dimerization) Result: • alternated short and long bonds • longer period = lower energy • result: chain of dimers • different phases available Peierl’s transitionPHAS0058, Lecture 1 Dr Monika Szumilo Types of dimerization (phases) trans-polyacetylene cis-polyacetylene degenerate non-degenerate NB. For inorganic semiconductors degenerate indicates instead a semiconductor doped so heavily that the Fermi Energy is inside the conduction or valence band.
