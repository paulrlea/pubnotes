Two equal masses, m, are constrained to move on a frictionless plane, one on the positive x axis and one on the positive y axis. They are attached to two identical springs, with force constant k, whose other ends are attached to the origin. In addition, the two masses are connected to each other by a third spring with force constant k;2. The springs are chosen so that the system is in equilibrium with all three springs relaxed (length equal to rest length). Consider a small displacement of the masses from the equilibrium position. a) What are the eigenfrequencies? b) Find the eigenvectors of the system. c) Describe (using words) the 2 normal modes of the system.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
