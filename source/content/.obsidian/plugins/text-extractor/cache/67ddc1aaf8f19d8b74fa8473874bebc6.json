Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 4 Classical Mechanics • A particle is an indivisible point of mass. • A system is a collection of particles with defined forces acting on them. • A trajectory is the position and momentum (r(t), p(t))of a particle as a function of time. • If we know the trajectory and forces on a particle at a given time, we can calculate the trajectory at a later time. By integrating through time, we can determine the trajectory of a particle at all times. 𝑚 𝑑2 Ԧ𝑟 𝑑𝑡2 = −∇𝑉( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡); Ԧ𝑝(𝑡) = 𝑚 𝑑 Ԧ𝑟 𝑑𝑡 Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 5 Some compelling experiments: The particlelike behavior of electromagnetic radiation • Simple experiments that tell us that light has both wavelike and particle-like behavior – The photoelectric effect (particle) – Double slit interference (wave) – X-ray diffraction (wave) – The Compton effect (particle) – Photon counting experiments (particle) Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 6 The photoelectric effect • In a photoelectric experiment, we measure the voltage necessary to stop an electron ejected from a surface by incident light of known wavelength. Krane Krane Krane Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 7 Interpretation of the photoelectric effect experiment Einstein introduced the idea that light carries energy in quantized bundles − photons. The energy in a quantum of light is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave that characterizes the light. The scaling constant can be found from the slope of 𝑒𝑉𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑝 vs wave frequency, 𝜈. It is found that: 𝒆𝑽𝒔𝒕𝒐𝒑 = 𝒉𝝂 − 𝜱𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒂𝒍 = 𝑬𝒑𝒉𝒐𝒕𝒐𝒏 − 𝜱 where ℎ = 6.626𝑥10 −34 joule−sec For light waves in vacuum, 𝑐 = 𝜆𝜈 = 3𝑥10 8 m/s, so we can also write: 𝑒𝑉𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑝 = ℎ𝑐 𝜆 − Φ𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙 A convenient (non−SI) substitution is ℎ𝑐 = 1240 eV−nm.

Millikan, Phys Rev 7, 355, (1916) Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 10 Photon Momentum: Compton scattering • The Compton effect involves scattering of electromagnetic radiation from electrons. • The scattered x-ray has a shifted wavelength (energy) that depends on scattered direction (from Krane) Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 11 Compton effect We use energy and momentum conservation laws: Energy ℎ𝑣′ = ℎ𝜈 − 𝐾𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑛 : 𝐾 = kinetic energy Momentum 𝑥 component: ℎ 𝜆 = ℎ 𝜆′ cos 𝜑 + 𝛾𝑚𝑣 cos 𝜃 𝑦 component: 0 = ℎ 𝜆′ sin 𝜑 + 𝛾𝑚𝑣 sin 𝜃 𝜆′ − 𝜆 = Δ𝜆 = ℎ 𝑚𝑐 1 − cos 𝜑 𝑚 = mass of electron; 𝛾=relativistic correction to electron momentum 𝑚𝑣 Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 12 Conclusions from the Compton Effect X−ray quanta of wavelength 𝜆 have: Kinetic energy: 𝐾 = ℎ𝑐 𝜆 Momentum: 𝑝 = ℎ 𝜆 Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 13 Double slit interference The intensity maxima in a double slit wave interference experiment occur at: 𝑑 sin 𝜃 = 𝑛𝜆 where 𝑑 is the distance between the slits. (The width of the overall pattern depends on the width of the slits.) Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 14 X-ray diffraction • In x-ray diffraction, x-ray waves diffracted from electrons on one atom interfere with waves diffracted from nearby atoms. • Such interference is most pronounced when atoms are arranged in a crystalline lattice. Bragg diffraction maxima are observed when: 2𝑑 sin 𝜃 = 𝑛𝜆 𝑑 = the distance between adjacent planes of atoms in the crystal. Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 15 Laue X-ray Diffraction Pattern • A Laue diffraction pattern is observed when x-rays of many wavelengths are incident on a crystal and diffraction can therefore occur from many planes simultaneously. …pretty from Krane Photon Coincidence Experiments Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 16 A more direct proof of the particle nature of light comes from an experiment in which a set of optical transitions (shown on the left) is exploited*. When a calcium atom is excited, the electron decays in two steps from the 4p excited state to the 4s ground state. The two decays occur within nanoseconds of each other, so a detector can be set up to detect only events co-incident with the first (551 nm) event. The intensity is set so that the system only observes one event at a time. *Grainger et al., Europhys Lett 1986 Photon Coincidence Experiments • A 50% beam splitter is placed in the beam arm set up to detect 423 nm waves. • Two photomultipliers (to detect single events) are set up on the two arms out of the beam-splitter. • It is observed that each detected event in PM1 and/or PM2 occurs only in PM! OR PM2, never both. • This provides evidence that photons are indivisible quanta. Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 17 Grainger et al., Europhys Lett 1986 Single Photon Experiments Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 18 Jaques et al, Science, 2007 In this experiment, the interferometer is large enough that it is possible to move the second beam splitter D after a photon has entered the system (A) and before it arrives at D. For the upper curve (a), arrival of single photons is detected at either PM1 or PM2, but never both simultaneously. The relative path lengths are varied after the photon enters the system. In case (a) we don’t know whether the photon traveled ABD or ACD, therefore the amplitides interfere. For curve (b) the beam splitter is rapidly removed after the photon enters the system and before it arrives at point D. We therefore know which path the photon took to a given detector, and the interference pattern disappears. Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 19 The bottom line on light • In many experiments, light behaves like a wave (c=phase velocity, =frequency, =wavelength). • In many other experiments, light behaves like a quantum particle (photon) with properties: energy: 𝑬𝒑𝒉𝒐𝒕𝒐𝒏 = 𝒉𝝂 = 𝒉𝒄 𝝀 momentum: 𝒑 = 𝒉 𝝀 and thus: 𝑬 = 𝒑𝒄 Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 20 Some compelling experiments: The wavelike behavior of particles • Experiments that tell us that electrons have wave-like properties – electron diffraction from crystals (waves) • Other particles – proton diffraction from nuclei – neutron diffraction from crystals Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 21 Electron diffraction from crystals • electron diffraction patterns from single crystal (above) and polycrystals (left) [from Krane] Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 22 Proton diffraction from nuclei from Krane Persans Quantum Physics Spring 2023 23 Neutron diffraction from a crystal from Krane Diffraction of fast neutrons from Al, Cu, and Pb nuclei.
