This means that the series beaks into two independent series – one even and one odd. • For the even series there is one arbitrary constant a0 from which all others are deduced. • The odd series starts with the arbitrary constant a1. • If either series is actually allowed to go to infinity, the wavefunction will sum to infinity unless l is only allowed to have a positive integer value. This causes the recursion relation to terminate at the lth term. 3D TISE 24  solution for central potential 3 We can deduce the solution for n=0 and use with the recursion relation.
