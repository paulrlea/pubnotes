(b) Calculate the displacement x(t) of the particle. (c) Calculate the speed of the particle v(t) as a function of time. (d) After having calculated x(t) and v(t) check whether the solutions reproduce the given v(x). (e) Calculate the force F (t)=m (dv/dt) as a function of time t. Is the result in agreement with the solutions to (a) and (b)? Assume v(x=0)=0 and x (t=0)=0.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
