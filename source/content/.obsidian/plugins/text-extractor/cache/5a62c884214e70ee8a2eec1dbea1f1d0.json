Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 4 Understanding expansion coefficients • The expansion coefficient is the amplitude of a specific eigenfunction that is needed to construct the wavefunction. • We can sometimes guess/estimate the coefficient just by looking at a wavefunction. – If the wavefunction is an even function, then the expansion coefficients for odd eigenfunctions will be zero. – If the wavefunction looks like an eigenfunction then the coefficient is probably a significant fraction of one. Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 5 Time evolution • Once the expansion coefficients are known, we can calculate the time evolution of the wavefunction. 𝜓𝑖 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝜓𝑖 𝑥, 0 𝑒𝑖𝜔𝑖𝑡 Ψ 𝑥, 𝑡 = ෍ 𝑖 𝑐𝑖𝜓𝑖(𝑥, 𝑡) • Finding the coefficients: PHYS2210Spring2022_Class08_1DWavefunctionCoefficients.ipynb • Viewing time evolution: Falstad.com/qm1d Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 6 Composing a wavefunction from eigenfunctions Ψ 𝑥 = 12 𝑎2 ( 𝑎 2 − 𝑥 ) Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 7 = 𝑐1 2 𝑎 cos 𝜋𝑥 𝑎 +𝑐2 2 𝑎 sin 2𝜋𝑥 𝑎 Here is the sum for c1=0.99, c3=0.11, c5=0.04 and c2, c4, c6…=0 Calculating Energy for Mixed States • 𝐸 = ∫ Ψ∗ ෡𝐻Ψ𝑑𝑥 • ∫ 𝑐1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝜓2 ∗𝐻 𝑐1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝜓2 dx • ∫ 𝑐1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝜓2 ∗ 𝐸1𝑐1𝜓1 + 𝐸2𝑐2𝜓2 dx • 𝐸 = 𝑐1 2𝐸1 + 𝑐2 2𝐸2 Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 8 Solving the Schrodinger Equation for Piecewise Constant Potentials Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 9Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 10 The Schrodinger Equation ෡𝐻𝜓 = ෠𝐸𝜓 − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 𝜓 + 𝑉(𝑥, 𝑡)𝜓 = 𝑖ℏ 𝜕𝜓 𝜕𝑡 and if V(x) is constant in time, − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2𝜓(𝑥) 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉(𝑥)𝜓(𝑥) = 𝐸𝜓(𝑥) ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2𝜓(𝑥) 𝜕𝑥2 + (𝐸 − 𝑉)𝜓(𝑥) = 0 Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 11 Piecewise potentials 1 • Many quantum physics problems can be solved by using the solutions for constant potential in each region and then matching up the solutions and derivatives at the boundaries. – Wavefunctions must always be matched. – Derivatives must be matched if the are no infinite potential steps in the problem.

Solutions for the Schrodinger equation curve toward the x-axis in classically allowed 𝐸 > 𝑉 regions and away from the axis in classically forbidden regions. 2. For bound states, the wavefunction must go to zero for large distances outside the well. (must be normalizable) 3. Curvature increases for larger 𝐸 − 𝑉(𝑥) . 4. Solutions are continuous and smooth if the potential has no infinite steps. 5. Energy eigenfunctions have an integer number of antinodes on classically allowed regions. 6. The wavefunction amplitude is usually larger in regions with small E>V. * From https:’’www.asc.ohio-state.edu/physics/ntg/H133/handouts/wavefunctions.pdf 14Quantum Physics 1 - Persans Illustrated “intuitive” rules 15 * from Townsend Ch 4 1.
