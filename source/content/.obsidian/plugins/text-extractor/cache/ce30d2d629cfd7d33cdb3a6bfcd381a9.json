A string (initially entirely at equilibrium position) is set into motion by being struck at a point L/4 from one end by a hammer. The initial velocity is greatest at x = L/4 (with a value of v0) and decreases linearly to zero at x = 0 and x = L/2. The region is initially undisturbed. Determine the subsequent motion of the string [q(x,t)]. Discuss which harmonics (if any) are absent from the system. [10 points] 2. A string is pulled aside a distance h at a point 3L/7 from one end. At a point 3L/7 from the other end, the string is pulled aside a distance h in the opposite direction. Discuss the vibrations [q(x,t)] and which harmonics (if any) are absent.
