You will address the material in chapter 5 with greater care in Intro to Quantum Mechanics. 2 Measurement • A system may be in a superposition of multiple eigenstates of a particular observable. • When we perform a measurement of an observable, we will only observe one of these eigenvalues. – The probability that we observe that one is proportional to the square of the coefficient for that state. • After we have performed the measurement, the system is now in the eigenstate corresponding to that measured value. • We say that the superposed quantum state “collapsed” into the eigenstate when we made the measurement. 3 Operators • In Quantum Mechanics every observable is represented by an operator that is used to obtain physical information about the system from state functions. For an observable that in classical physics is represented by 𝑄(𝑥, 𝑝), the operator is ෠𝑄( ො𝑥, ො𝑝). 4 Operators – Operators must act on a function – Operators act on every function to their right unless their action is constrained by brackets – The product of operators implies successive operation (starting with the rightmost). – The sequence of operations does not necessarily commute. – addition or subtraction of operators means to distribute the operations 5 Linearity and Superposition If there exist two distinct state functions of a system with Hamiltonian H, then for arbitrary constants c1 and c2 the linear combination c1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝜓2 also satisfies the TDSE: ෡𝐻 − ෠𝐸 𝑐1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝜓2 = 𝑐1 ෡𝐻 − ෠𝐸 𝜓1 + 𝑐2 ෡𝐻 − ෠𝐸 𝜓2 = 0 An arbitrary linear combination represents a quantum state of the system. This property of an operator is known as linearity. 6 Operators and Eigenvalues In quantum physics, the form of the eigenvalue equation for an observable መ𝐴 with eigenstate 𝜓𝑎 and eigenvalue 𝑎 is: መ𝐴𝜓𝑎 = 𝑎𝜓. The collection of all eigenvalues is called the spectrum of this operator. The most familiar eigenstate is the stationary state. Ψ𝐸 = 𝜓𝐸𝑒−𝑖𝐸𝑡/ℏ which satisfies: ෡𝐻Ψ = 𝐸Ψ In an eigenstate of an observable, the uncertainty in that observable is zero. 7 The eigenstate of one observable might not be an eigenstate of another observable (but it can happen). Example− An energy eigenstate of the square well is: Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴 cos 𝜋𝑥 𝐿 𝑒−𝑖𝜔1𝑡 with 𝜔1 = 𝐸1 ℏ = ℏ𝜋2 2𝑚𝐿2 . Is this an energy eigenstate of momentum ො𝑝 = −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 ? ො𝑝Ψ = −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 𝐴 cos 𝜋𝑥 𝐿 𝑒−𝑖𝜔1𝑡 = 𝑖ℏ𝐴 𝜋 𝐿 sin 𝜋𝑥 𝐿 𝑒−𝑖𝜔1𝑡 ≠ 𝑝Ψ NO! Eigenstates of different operators • Another example: An energy eigenstate of the free wave is: Ψ = 𝐴𝑒𝑖 𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡 . Is this an eigenstate of momentum? Ƹ𝑝Ψ = −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 𝐴𝑒𝑖 𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡 = ℏ𝑘Ψ=pΨ YES> 89 Hermitian Operators/Hermiticity ෠𝑄 is Hermitian if for any two physically admissible state functions: නΨ1 ∗ ෠𝑄Ψ2𝑑𝑥 = න(෡Q∗Ψ1 ∗)Ψ2𝑑𝑥 If an operator is Hermitian, the expectation value of that operator will be real. All operators for physically measurable quantities are Hermitian. Plausibility for Hermiticity • If a quantity is physically observable it must be real, and it’s expectation value will be real as well. Thus 𝐴 = 𝐴 ∗ • In integral form: නΨ∗ መ𝐴Ψ 𝑑𝑥 = නΨ∗ መ𝐴Ψ 𝑑𝑥 ∗ = නΨ መ𝐴Ψ ∗𝑑𝑥 = න መ𝐴Ψ ∗Ψ𝑑𝑥 1011 Hermiticity: Meaning and utility • All operators representing measurable quantities in quantum mechanics are Hermitian. – Expectation values of a Hermitian operator are real. • Any real function of a Hermitian operator is also Hermitian. • The product of two Hermitian operators is Hermitian iff the two operators commute. • A linear combination of two Hermitian operators is Hermitian iff the constants in the linear combinations are real. 12 Is p Hermitian?

Start by integrating න −∞ ∞ Ψ1 ∗ −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ2 𝑑𝑥 by parts. න −∞ ∞ Ψ1 ∗ −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ2 𝑑𝑥 = −𝑖ℏ ቚΨ1 ∗Ψ2 −∞ ∞ − න −∞ ∞ Ψ2 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ1 ∗ 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑖ℏ න −∞ ∞ Ψ2 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ1 ∗ 𝑑𝑥 = න −∞ ∞ Ψ2 −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ1 ∗ 𝑑𝑥 Therefore ොp is Hermitian. Is 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Hermitian? Is ׬−∞ ∞ Ψ1 ∗ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ2 𝑑𝑥= ׬−∞ ∞ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ1 ∗ Ψ2𝑑𝑥? • You do the math. 1314 Hermiticity: Real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenfunctions • The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real. • The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are the only values that we can observe in a measurement of that observable. AND The eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator are orthogonal, constitute a complete set, and satisfy closure. 15 Proof of orthogonality of the eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator We want to demonstrate that න𝜓𝑞 ′ 𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 = 0 for two eigenfunctions of the same observable (𝑞 ≠ 𝑞′): 1) ෠𝑄𝜓𝑞 = 𝑞𝜓𝑞 and 2) ෠𝑄𝜓𝑞′ = 𝑞′𝜓𝑞′ Multiply both sides of 1) by 𝜓𝑞′∗and integrate: 𝐴) 𝜓𝑞′∗ × 1): න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ ෠𝑄𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 = 𝑞 න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ 𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 because q is real. But if ෡Q is Hermitian we also have: 𝐵) න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ ෠𝑄𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 = න( ෠𝑄∗𝜓𝑞′ ∗ ) 𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 = 𝑞′ න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ 𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 subtracting A from B we have: (𝑞′ − 𝑞) න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ 𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 = 0, but we assumed 𝑞 ≠ 𝑞′ so න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ 𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 = 0 The two eigenfunctions are orthogonal. 16 Hermiticity: Completeness Completeness of a set of eigenfunctions means that any well−behaved function of the variables on which the eigenfunctions depend can be expanded upon the set. 1) 𝑓 = ෍ 𝑞 𝑐𝑞𝜓𝑞 We can choose to represent any function in a given range of variables by an expansion in a set of eigenfunctions of any operator. It′s easy to find the coefficients 𝑐𝑞. Multiply both sides of 1) by 𝜓𝑞′ ∗ and integrate න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ 𝑓𝑑𝑥 = න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ ෍ 𝑐𝑞𝜓𝑞 𝑑𝑥 = ෍ 𝑐𝑞 න𝜓𝑞′ ∗ 𝜓𝑞𝑑𝑥 = 𝑐𝑞′ The coefficient 𝑐𝑞 is the \"projection\" of 𝑓 onto the eigenfunction 𝜓𝑞 17 A New Operator The Parity Operator: ෡Π What are its properties? Definition ෡Π𝑓( Ԧ𝑟) = 𝑓(− Ԧ𝑟) ෡Π𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑥) = 𝑓(−𝑥, −𝑦, −𝑧) ෡𝜫 is linear ෡Π 𝑐1𝑓1(𝑥) + 𝑐2𝑓2(𝑥) = 𝑐1𝑓1(−𝑥) + 𝑐2𝑓2(−𝑥) = 𝑐1 ෡Π𝑓1(𝑥) + 𝑐2 ෡Π𝑓2(𝑥) 18 ෡𝜫 is Hermitian න𝜓1 ∗(𝑥) ෡Π𝜓2(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = න ෡Π𝜓1(𝑥) ∗ 𝜓2(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥? Working on the LHS: න𝜓1 ∗(𝑥) ෡Π𝜓2(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = න𝜓1 ∗(𝑥) 𝜓2(−𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 change the dummy variable of integration න −∞ ∞ 𝜓1 ∗(𝑥) 𝜓2(−𝑥)𝑑𝑥 = න ∞ −∞ 𝜓1 ∗(−𝑥) 𝜓2(𝑥)𝑑(−𝑥) = − න ∞ −∞ ෡Π𝜓1(𝑥) ∗ 𝜓2(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 = න −∞ ∞ ෡Π𝜓1(𝑥) ∗ 𝜓2(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 And since it is Hermitian it’s eigenfunctions must form a complete, orthogonal set. – Let’s check. 19 Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Parity operator Let′s try to find λ′𝑠 that solve: ෡Π𝜓𝑞(𝑥) = 𝜆𝜓𝜆(𝑥) 𝜓𝜆(−𝑥) = 𝜆𝜓𝜆(𝑥) Now operate ෡Π on both sides ෡Π𝜓𝜆 −𝑥 = ෡Π𝜆𝜓𝜆 𝑥 ⇒ 𝜓𝜆(𝑥) = 𝑞 ෡Π𝜓𝜆(𝑥) = 𝜆2𝜓𝜆(𝑥) from which we deduce λ= ± 1 Therefore any function that is an eigenfunction of the parity operator is either even or odd. 20 Orthogonality of eigenfunctions of the Parity operator ׬ 𝜙𝜆=−1 ∗ 𝜓𝜆=1𝑑𝑥 = 0 ? • The product of an even and an odd function is an odd function. • The integral of an odd function over all space is zero. • Therefore the overlap of an even and an odd function 𝜙−1, 𝜓1 is zero. • Therefore eigenfunctions of different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Completeness of the Parity Operator Define the function Ψ+ 𝑥 = 1 2 𝜓 𝑥 + 𝜓 −𝑥 . We can show that Ψ+ 𝑥 is even: ෡ΠΨ+ 𝑥 = 1 2 ෡Π𝜓 𝑥 + ෡Π𝜓 −𝑥 = 1 2 𝜓 −𝑥 + 𝜓 𝑥 = Ψ+(𝑥) Similarly Ψ− 𝑥 = 1 2 𝜓 𝑥 − 𝜓 −𝑥 is odd. So Ψ+ 𝑥 + Ψ− 𝑥 = 𝜓(𝑥) shows that any state function can be written as a superposition of an even and an odd function. 2122 Dirac braket notation Dirac Notation − \"bra\"= \"ket\"= 𝑄 = ȁΨ1 ෠𝑄Ψ1 = න 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒 Ψ1∗ ෠𝑄Ψ1𝑑𝑥 =expectation value ȁΨ1 ෠𝑄Ψ2 = න 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒 Ψ1∗ ෠𝑄Ψ2𝑑𝑥 =matrix element ȁΨ1 Ψ1 = න 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒 Ψ1∗Ψ2𝑑𝑥 =overlap integral 1) Take the complex conjugate of the function inside the 2) Act with the operator on the function to its right. 3) Integrate the integrand over all space. It can be tiresome to write the same integrals repeatedly. Dirac notation saves some ink, and provides conceptual flexibility. 23 Useful properties of Dirac notation ȁ𝜓1 𝑐𝜓2 = 𝑐 ȁ𝜓1 𝜓2 where c is a constant 𝑐 ȁ𝜓1 𝜓2 = 𝑐∗ ȁ𝜓1 𝜓2 ȁ𝜓1 𝜓2 ∗ = ȁ𝜓2 𝜓1 ȁ𝜓1 + 𝜓2 𝜓3 + 𝜓4 = ȁ𝜓1 𝜓3 + ȁ𝜓1 𝜓4 + ȁ𝜓2 𝜓3 + ȁ𝜓2 𝜓4 Eigenvalue Expansions • This will be a somewhat more formal discussion of composing a wavefunction out of eigenfunctions. • Note that the wavefunction we wish to represent must obey the same boundary conditions as the eigenfunctions. • Wavefunctions are normalizable solutions to the wave equation that obey the same boundary conditions as the eigenfunctions. • Eigenfunctions must additionally obey the relation: ෡𝐻𝜓𝑞 = 𝑞𝜓𝑞. 2425 Summarizing Eigenfunction Expansions 26 The meaning and use of expansions • The collection of coefficients in the expansion of a state function in any complete set is merely an alternate way to represent the state function. • These coefficients and the eigenfunctions contain the same information as the state function. • Expressing a state function in terms of eigenfunctions can make apparent some properties of the state function. • Expressing the state function in terms of eigenfunctions can allow us to get information about other variables. (Expressing the wavefunction (position variable) in terms of momentum eigenfunctions allows us to determine the momentum properties of the state function.) 27 Using expansions to calculate expectation values • If we have a wavefunction that is not an eigenfunction of a given operator, the expectation value may be hard to calculate in the old way. • Expanding the wavefunction in terms of the eigenfunctions of that operator may make things easier. 28 Example: Calculation of the mean 𝑄 (𝑡) = නΨ∗ ෠𝑄 Ψ𝑑𝑥 = න ෍ 𝑐𝑛′(𝑡)𝜓𝑛′(𝑥) ∗ ෠𝑄 ෍ 𝑐𝑛(𝑡)𝜓𝑛(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = න ෍ 𝑐𝑛′(𝑡)𝜓𝑛′(𝑥) ∗ ෍ 𝑐𝑛(𝑡)𝑞𝑛𝜓𝑛(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = ෍ 𝑛′ ෍ 𝑛 𝑐𝑛′∗𝑐𝑛 𝜓𝑛′ ۧ𝜓𝑛 = ෍ 𝑛 𝑐𝑛 2𝑞𝑛 If we know the projection coefficients, we know the expectation value (and we know the probability that we will observe a specific outcome. 29 Example: Expectation value of energy Calculate the expectation value of the energy for the following non−stationary state of the SHO. Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 1 50 𝜓1𝑒−𝑖𝜔1𝑡 + 7𝜓2𝑒−𝑖𝜔2𝑡 𝑐1(𝑡) = 1 50 𝑒−𝑖𝜔1𝑡; 𝑐2(𝑡) = 7 50 𝑒−𝑖𝜔2𝑡 (all others=0) 𝐸 (𝑡) = ෍ 𝑛=0 ∞ 𝑐𝑛 2𝐸𝑛 = 1 50 3 2 ℏ𝜔0 + 49 50 5 2 ℏ𝜔0 = 62 50 ℏ𝜔0 Note that any individual measurement of E will yield an eigenenergy. 30 Physical meaning of expansions • The collection of expansion coefficients in a state function is merely an alternate way to represent this physical state. They contain the same information as the state function itself. • The expansion coefficients may be useful. – The wave function explicitly shows the dependence of the state function on space and time. If we are interested in another property, such as energy, it may be more informative to represent the state function in terms of energy eigenstates. – The coefficients cq are properly called, the probability amplitudes for the observable Q. – Knowledge of the probability of a certain outcome may provide physical insight into the situation. Commuting Operators • The commutator is the combination of two operators in which the difference is taken between the operations performed in different order: Commutator≡ 𝐴𝑜𝑝, 𝐵𝑜𝑝 = (𝐴𝑜𝑝𝐵𝑜𝑝 − 𝐵𝑜𝑝𝐴𝑜𝑝) • Whether two operators commute or not can tell us a lot about the nature of the eigenfunctions of the operators without even solving the Schrodinger equation. 31 Information from the Commutator • A complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of two Hermitian operators exists iff the operators commute. • If two operators do not commute and their commutator can be expressed as 𝐴𝑜𝑝, 𝐵𝑜𝑝 = 𝑖𝐶𝑜𝑝 where 𝐶𝑜𝑝 is a Hermitian operator, then an uncertainty relation of the form Δ𝐴Δ𝐵 ≥ 𝐶 2 must hold. 32 Example of Commuting Operators • Parity Operator: Π • Hamiltonian for a symmetric potential: – 𝐻𝑆𝑌𝑀 = − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉(𝑥) where 𝑉 𝑥 = 𝑉 −𝑥 𝐻𝑆𝑌𝑀, Π = − ℏ 2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉(𝑥) ΠΨ 𝑥 − Π − ℏ 2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉(𝑥) Ψ 𝑥 = − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉(𝑥) Ψ −𝑥 − − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕 −𝑥 2 + 𝑉(−𝑥) Ψ −𝑥 = − ℏ 2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉(𝑥) Ψ −𝑥 − − ℏ 2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕 𝑥 2 + 𝑉(𝑥) Ψ −𝑥 = 0 33 When two Hermitian operators commute, they share a complete set of eigenfunctions. • We can then measure both of these quantities simultaneously without uncertainty. • Argument Given 𝐴𝑜𝑝, 𝐵𝑜𝑝 = 0 Apply 𝐵𝑜𝑝 to the equation 𝐴𝑜𝑝𝜓𝑎 = 𝑎𝜓𝑎 . 𝐵𝑜𝑝𝐴𝑜𝑝𝜓𝑎 = 𝑎𝐵𝑜𝑝𝜓𝑎 And because they commute: 𝐴𝑜𝑝(𝐵𝑜𝑝𝜓𝑎) = 𝑎(𝐵𝑜𝑝𝜓𝑎) This tells us that (𝐵𝑜𝑝𝜓𝑎) is an eigenfunction of A𝑜𝑝 34 Uncertainty • The uncertainty of an arbitrary observable is given by: Δ𝐴 = 𝐴 − 𝐴 2 = 𝐴 − 𝐴 2 • If many measurements are analyzed, then Δ𝐴 is the standard deviation of the measurements. • The variance is defined as Δ𝐴 2 = 𝐴2 − 𝐴 2 • If we define 𝑈𝑜𝑝 = 𝐴𝑜𝑝 − 𝐴 , then න𝜓∗𝑈𝑜𝑝 2 𝜓𝑑𝑥 = Δ𝐴 2 35 Uncertainty Relations • If two Hermitian operators do not commute, their commutator can be expressed as 𝐴𝑜𝑝, 𝐵𝑜𝑝 = 𝑖𝐶𝑜𝑝 where 𝐶𝑜𝑝is Hermitian so ׬ 𝜓∗𝐶𝑜𝑝𝜓 = 𝐶 . • It can be shown that Δ𝐴Δ𝐵 ≥ 𝐶 2 . 36 Momentum-Position Example • 𝑝𝑜𝑝 = −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 and 𝑥𝑜𝑝 = 𝑥 • 𝑝𝑜𝑝, 𝑥 𝜓 = −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 𝑥𝜓 − 𝑥 −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 𝜓 = −𝑖ℏ( 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 𝑥𝜓 − 𝑥 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 𝜓) = −𝑖ℏ 𝜓 + 𝑥 𝜕𝜓 𝜕𝑥 − 𝑥 𝜕𝜓 𝜕𝑥 = −𝑖ℏ𝜓 • And applying the uncertainty relation from the previous page: Δ𝑝Δ𝑥 ≥ ℏ 2 . 3738 Commutators of x and p • A compendium of what certain symbols represent. – https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/greek_letters.png 39","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
