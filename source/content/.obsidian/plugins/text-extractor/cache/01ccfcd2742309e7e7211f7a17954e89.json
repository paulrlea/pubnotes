Assess the viability of a perovskite with the composions below. Support your analysis with appropriate calculaons. a. KFeO3 b. NaMnF3 c. MgTiO3 d. BaTiO3 e. LaAlO3 2. Predict how substuon of MA in MAPbI3 perovskite with FA and Cs aﬀects structure stability and optoelectronic properes of a perovskite. 3. A perovskite ﬁlm has a charge carrier mobility of 20 cm 2 V -1 s -1 and a carrier lifeme of 100 ns. Calculate the carrier diﬀusion length. How does this value compare to typical diﬀusion lengths in other semiconductors? 4. A perovskite solar cell has a defect density of 10 15 cm -3. Assuming that each defect acts as a recombinaon centre, esmate the carrier lifeme due to defect-assisted recombinaon. How does this compare to the radiave recombinaon lifeme in a high-quality perovskite? 5. A perovskite ﬁlm has an absorpon coeﬃcient of 10 5 cm -1 at a parcular wavelength. Calculate the ﬁlm thickness required to absorb 90% of the incident light at that wavelength.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
