Orthogonality () where and are independent solutions to a Sturm-Liouville equation. S-L equations have the form: ( ) ( ) ( ) with ( ) ( ) Examples of S-L equations are: Wav n m nm solutionregion nm x dv Ly x x y x L p x q x xx              e equation, Legendre's equation, Laguerre's equation, Hermite's equation, Bessel's equation.
