Hints - Fit the data from Section I (of the Compton Lab Instructions Manual) to the function where a is the free parameter . Don’ t for get to include a scaling 1 𝑟 𝑎 constant to the curve-fit. Include appropriate error bars. Gamma-radiation is a form of ionizing radiation. 𝛾-rays are ener getic photons, similar to visible light but at much higher frequency , and hence ener gy. They interact with matter by a variety of mechanisms, such as photoelectric ef fect, Compton scattering, and electron-positron pair production. The probability of the interaction depends both on its ener gy and the 𝛾-ray interaction cross section of the material. 𝛾-rays can be emitted by Gamma decay processes, which are a decay of an excited nucleus into a lower ener gy state. In this process, parent and daughter atoms are the same chemical element, and the emitted 𝛾-ray and recoiling nucleus e ach have a well defined ener gy after the decay. 𝛾-rays and X-rays overlap the range of the ener gy, are distinguished only by their source. When photons are generated by a nuclear reaction, they are called 𝛾-rays. 𝛾-rays extend to higher frequencies than X-rays. 𝛾-ray emission follows the inverse square law . The interaction of char ged particles and photons with matter is electromagnetic in nature, and results in the loss of ener gy or absorption of photons. Alpha particles lose ener gy predominantly by colliding with electrons in atoms and electrons lose ener gy in both the collision with electrons in atoms and by emitting radiation when their trajectory is affected by the field of nucleus. Photons lose ener gy by colliding with electrons in atoms either by photoelectric (low ener gy photons) or the Compton ef fect (medium range photons<2MeV). High-ener gy photons lose ener gy by creating electron-positron pairs. The distribution of ener gy of 𝛾-ray emission for a certain source is shown in the ener gy spectra. The ener gy spectrum of Enriched Uranium (Figure 1) shows the number of decays (or counts) as a function of ener gy of its 𝛾-radiation. The photopeak of a source describes the ener gy distribution of emitted 𝛾-rays of a particu lar nuclear transition. SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 Section II: Detection and Attenuation In order to study Compton scattering, you must be able to measure the ener gy of photons. This is achieved with a NaI crystal. When ionizing radiation such as 𝛾-radiation propagates into a scintillator NaI crystal, electrons in the crystal are excited and the radiation loses the ener gy. Rapid interatomic transfer of excited electron ener gy eventually leads to emission of a burst of luminescence. This burst of luminescence is called scintillation. The integral of the luminescent response is a measure of the ener gy of the ionizing radiation. The dimensions of the photodetector used in this lab is .2\" × 2\" Figure 1 : The 𝛾-ray spectrum of Enriched Uranium with the 𝛾-energy photopeak at 1 8 6 keV This scintillation light is detected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT), which converts single photons to a measurable electrical signal through the photoelectric ef fect. When a photon hits a metallic cathode of a PMT , an electron is ejected from the surface of the cathode. The ejected electron is directed to the electron multiplier caused by the electric field between the focusing electrode and cathode. The electron multiplier consists of an array of electrodes which has a sequentially increasing electrical potential (dynodes). When the electron hits the surface of the first dynode, several secondary electrons will be produced. These secondary electrons are further accelerated by the electric field between the first and the second dynodes. By repeating this process, suf ficiently lar ge amount of electrons, 10 5 -10 7 per incident electron, will be produced. SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 When the PMT is combined with a scintillation counter , the amplitude of the current signal is directly proportional to the ener gy of the incident photons. Finally , the electrical signal is digitized, and proportionally converted to counts. Thus, the number of counts is proportional to the ener gy of the incident photon. This concept is called spectroscopy , and an ener gy distribution measured in this matter is called a spectrum. By fitting a Gaussian to the 𝛾-ray emission ener gy p hotopeak in a spectrum, we can accurately determine the ener gy of the ionizing radiation, which you will do for the Compton scattering portion. Attenuation Expected - Determine the attenuation coef ficient of the aluminum sheets of Section II by fitting a curve to the transmission probability as a function of thickness. The transmission probability for a gamma-ray of a certain ener gy through a certain medium is (1)𝑇 = 𝑒− µ𝑥 where x is the thickness of the material and is its attenuation coef ficient. Attenuation occursµ when an incident gamma-ray loses ener gy after interacting with an electron in the attenuation material. The transmission probability , T, is where I is the total counts of incident photons at 𝐼 𝐼 0 the gamma ener gy at a certain thickness, and is total counts without any attenuation. In𝐼0 general, the attenuation coef ficient is unique for different radiation ener gies. Section III: Compton Scattering Expected - Fit a gaussian to the shifting photopeaks. The ener gy is the x-value where the peak occurs. Fit a curve to the shifting photopeak ener gy ( E’) as a function of scattering angle from the data collected in Section III to find the rest mass of anθ electron. - Include a plot of the data collected and of the curve fit. Compton scattering is the inelastic scattering of a high-ener gy photons ( 𝛾-ray) usually by an electron. In 1920, A.H. Compton observed the scattering of monochromatic high-ener gy electromagnetic waves from a carbon tar get and found that the scattered wave had a longer wavelength than the incident wave, and hence a lower ener gy. It was also observed that the change of the ener gies between the incident and scattered waves increased with scattering angle. SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 The result was inconsistent with classical wave theory where the frequency is a property of the incoming electromagnetic wave and cannot be altered by the change of the direction due to scattering. Compton modeled the data by assuming a particle nature of the photon and applied conservation of ener gy and momentum to the collision between the photon and the electron. At the time of the observation, the particle nature of light suggested by the photoelectric ef fect was still being debated; the Compton experiment gave clear and independent evidence of the particle-like behavior of light. Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1927 for the discovery of the Compton Ef fect. The Compton Ef fect is based on conservation of momentum. Knowing, relativistically , the momentum of a particle is and its ener gy is , after a collision, where the new velocity ℎ𝑣 𝑐 𝐸 = ℎ𝑣 of the particle is and the new momentum is , we can use equation (2) to find the change in𝑣' 𝑝 ener gy of the particle. , (2)ℎ𝑣 + 𝑚𝑐2 − ℎ𝑣' = 𝑝𝑐2 + ( 𝑚𝑐2 ) 2 where m is the mass of the scattered electron. The change in wavelength of a 𝛾-ray after being scattered through applying the conservation of momentum is (3)∆λ = ℎ𝑐 𝐸' − ℎ𝑐 𝐸 = ℎ 𝑚𝑐 ( 1 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠θ) In equation (3), E is the ener gy of incident photons, E’ is the ener gy of photons scattered in direction of θ, m is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, and θ is the scattering angle. When photons scatter , E’ will shift horizontally as a function of θ. The derivation for equation (3) comes from the Napolitano text. Rewriting this, we get equation (4), which is the new ener gy as a function of scattering angle. E is the initial ener gy without scattering. Hint: E is the ener gy used for calibration. (4) 1 𝐸' = 1 𝑚𝑐 2 ( 1 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠θ) + 1 𝐸 Rewriting (4), we get a clearer picture of how to use a curve fit to find m, using equation (5). (5)𝐸' = 𝐸 1 + ( 𝐸/𝑚𝑐 2 ) ( 1 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠θ) Section IV: Differ ential Cr oss-Section of Aluminum Rod and Classical Radius of an Electron SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 Note: This procedure is also described in the supplementary material found in the LMS site: filename: compton_scattering_supplementary material.pdf Expected - Use a curve-fit to determine the classical radius of an electron. - Include a plot of as a function of scattering angle θ using the measurements 𝑑σ 𝑑Ω made in Section III of the Instruction Manual. Hint - Combine the equations (6) and (7) and solve for as a function of scatteringΣγ' angle , and fit the curve to to solve for r.θ Σγ' - You should already have gaussian fits for the shifting photopeaks from the previous section, so now all you need to do is integrate those using the quadrature function from the Scipy library . This will give you the total # of counts (= total # of decays) within the photopeak. The differential cross-section for Compton scattering, first proposed by Klein and Nishina (eq. 6), is where is the cross-sectional area component in the plane of the initial electrons, and 𝑑σ 𝑑Ω 𝑑σ is the solid angle of the scattered photons scattered at an angle θ.𝑑Ω Figure 2 : The differential cross-section of a particle scattered off a scattering center. 𝑑σ 𝑑Ω In our setup, the scattering center shown in Figure 2 is the scattering volume of the aluminum or unknown rod, and the scattered particle is the one emitted from the Cesium-137 source.

The weight fraction of the scattering rod , by 𝑖 ∑ 𝑤𝑖 definition for a pure material, sums to 1. The scattering volume is dif ferent from the entire volume of the rod. The radiation from the Cs-137 source is assumed to be a rectangular beam with a width of the scattering rod and height of the lead hole the source sits in. The volume of the scattered material is therefore a shortened cylinder with a height of approximately 2 cm. I in equation (7) is the number of incident 𝛾-rays/ per second at the scattering rod.𝑐𝑚2 There are essentially two approaches in computing the differential cross-section using the data from the aluminum rod based on how I (flux of 𝛾-rays) is estimated. SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 Appr oach 1: Using the intrinsic activity of the Cs-137 source, one can setup the following equation for the photon flux at the scattering rod: , (9)𝐼 = 𝐴 0 𝑓 4 π𝑅 1 2 where is the activity of the source, 10mCi, f is the fraction of gamma-ray emissions, 0.851 for𝐴0 Cs-137, and is the distance from the source to the center of the scattering rod (=31cm).𝑅1 Remember to convert the units of Ci (Curies) to # of decays. Appr oach 2: Use the measurement of the Cs-137 photopeak (at 661.7keV) with the detector at without the0 ◦ aluminum rod in place (this was done at the beginning of Section III of the Instruction Manual). Assume the inverse square law holds and use that to compute the incident flux at the scattering rod. The photon flux at the detector will be equal to the total # of decays (= # of counts) from the integral of the photopeak which is then divided by the area of the detector and the scan time (=120s). Use the inverse square law to scale the photon flux measured at the detector in order to get the estimate at the scattering rod. Use both approaches in estimating the value of “ I”, the incident photon flux at the scattering rod, and compare the computed values of r, the classical electron radius from the curve fit. You will also need the following information to complete the computation: The solid angle of the scintillation detector is , (10)∆Ω = π( 𝐷/2 ) 2 𝑅 2 2 where D is the diameter of the scintillator (5.08 cm) and is the distance from the center of the𝑅2 scattering rod to the front of the detector . In the final part of the experiment, you will try to deduce the composition of the unknown material. Note that the dif ferential cross-section is identical, and you have measured the total decays ( ) as a function of scattering angle. Therefore the only unknown is the # of electronΣγ' scatterers in the material given by equation (8). Look at the unknown material and take a guess as to what you think it is composed of. Then look through the literature and use the documented SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 composition of the manufactured material to compute the measured value of . You may need𝑛θ to tweak the weight fraction of each element to get the best fit. SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
