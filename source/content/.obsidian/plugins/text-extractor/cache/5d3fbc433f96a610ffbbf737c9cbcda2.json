No contests will be considered after a week following the return/posting of scores of the material. Further, you must keep all your graded HWs and exams until the end of the semester in case there are any clerical errors (this may be a non-issue now, if all submitted assignments now will be saved and graded on LMS). Homework assignments: Homework assignments will be posted roughly every two weeks. Late homework will not be accepted without prior approval from the instructor. Covered material: The principles and physical applications of classical thermodynamics are developed. Basic concepts in classical and quantum statistical mechanics are introduced and their relations to thermodynamics are developed. Academic Integrity Policy: Academic integrity is one of the cornerstones of RPI. Students taking courses at RPI have a right to expect that their work will be evaluated fairly with respect to other students. They have a right to expect that other students will not attempt to enhance their own grades or the grades of their friends by cheating. Professors have a right to expect that their students are honest and submit work reflecting their own efforts. In an atmosphere of academic integrity, students and professors are on the same team trying to achieve the same learning objectives. Collaboration and discussion is allowed and encouraged in homeworks. However, you must carry out, write up, and turn in your own solutions. On exams, you’re on your own and not allowed to discuss anything with your classmates. Thus, don’t copy someone else’s solutions, and don’t cheat on exams. If I suspect you of either, I’ll ask for an explanation. If your explanation is unsatisfactory, you’ll be given a grade of zero and reported to the Dean of Students. If this happens more than once, you will be given an F for the course. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate text or problem solutions is prohibited. Submission of work generated by AI will be considered a violation of academic integrity. Diversity: At RPI we support an inclusive learning environment where diversity and individual differences are understood, respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. I expect that students, and faculty will respect differences and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other peoples' perspectives, behaviors, and world views may be different from their own. Students in this class are encouraged to speak up and participate during class. Because the class will represent a diversity of individual beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences, every member of this class must show respect for every other member of this class. Accommodations: We all learn differently, and we want every student to succeed in the course. If you have a learning need or disability, please contact Student Life office so that they can provide the appropriate documentation for accommodations. COVID-19 Notice: Rensselaer is committed to the health and safety of all students. Rensselaer will continue to monitor all new developments with COVID-19 and determine a best course of action to uphold the well-being of its students while maintaining a high quality educational experience. Covid-19 measures can change as they will be reviewed and updated as circumstances change.
