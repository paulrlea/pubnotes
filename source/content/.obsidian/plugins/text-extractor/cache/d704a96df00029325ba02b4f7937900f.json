Note that this problem is given separately from 22-25 in Gradescope and that only the print PDF of the problem is given there. You may complete this problem on another platform, but I can help you best if you use Jupyter Notebook. 22) Townsend Problem 3.5 – Probability of observation of energy eigenvalue and energy expectation values for a sum of eigenfunctions. 23) Townsend Problem 3.8 – A more math-y version (different wavefunction) of Problem 3.5. 24) Townsend Problem 3.12 – Sudden expansion of a well to twice its width and consequent probability of an observation of the new ground state. 25) Townsend 4.04","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
