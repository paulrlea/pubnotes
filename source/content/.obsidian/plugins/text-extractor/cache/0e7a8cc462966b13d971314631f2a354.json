Show explicitly, that high low high low T T Q Q = , i.e., the efficiency of this engine, using ideal gas as the working substance, is high low T T −= 1η . (This, of course, just provides an example for Carnot’s principle, that is, all reversible engines operating between the same pair of temperatures have the above optimal efficiency. Hint: based on the equation of state, the expression for the internal energy, and the definition of work, find explicitly the heat transferred during the isothermal segments of the cycle, highQ and lowQ . 2. Using the equation of state and the expression for the internal energy, find the entropy of the van der Waals gas, ),( VES (the number of particles N is fixed). (Hint: you may first try to obtain ),( VTS and then using again the expression for the internal energy for the v.d.W. gas, obtain ),( VES . 3. Determine the relationship between T and V for the (quasistatic) adiabatic process for the v.d.W. gas. Then obtain the relationship between P and V . Sketch )(VP for the above process and also sketch )(VP for the isothermal process of the v.d.W. gas (on the same graph), starting at the same temperature and volume. Compare them and discuss your findings. 4. Prove the following important and general thermodynamic relationship: P T P T V E VT −      ∂ ∂ =      ∂ ∂ . Note that this relationship is independent of the specific substance. It explicitly shows that the equation of state ),( VTP and the internal energy ),( VTE are not independent of each other. Hint: start with the First Law, PdVTdSdE −= , then use the appropriate Maxwell relationship to obtain the desired result. 5. The Joule process (or free expansion). Consider a gas, which expands into a vacuum from V1 to V2 while the system is thermally isolated. (a) Show that the temperature change during this process is given by ∫ −∂∂ −=−=∆ 2 1 )/( 12 V V V V dV C PTPT TTT . (b) Calculate the temperature change under the Joule process for the ideal gas. (c) Calculate the temperature change under the Joule process for the van der Waal gas.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
