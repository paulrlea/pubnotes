Is this consistent with the Schrodinger equation? • First calculate the time derivative of the probability density: 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑡 = 𝜕Ψ∗Ψ 𝜕𝑡 = Ψ∗ 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑡 + Ψ 𝜕Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑡 (1) • And from the SE: 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑡 = 1 𝑖ℏ − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2Ψ 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉 𝑥 Ψ and 𝜕Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑡 = −1 𝑖ℏ − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉 𝑥 Ψ∗ and substituting space derivatives for time derivatives in (1): 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑡 = Ψ∗ 1 𝑖ℏ − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2Ψ 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉 𝑥 Ψ − Ψ 1 𝑖ℏ − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉 𝑥 Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑡 = iℏ 2𝑚 Ψ∗ ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2Ψ 𝜕𝑥2 − Ψ ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑥2 = iℏ 2𝑚 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ∗ 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑥 − Ψ 𝜕Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑥 Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 5 Conservation of probability From the previous page: 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑡 = iℏ 2𝑚 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ∗ 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑥 − Ψ 𝜕Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑥 So the rate of change of the total probability is: 𝜕 𝜕𝑡 ׬ 𝑃𝑑𝑥 = ׬ 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑡 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑖ℏ 2𝑚 න −∞ ∞ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ψ∗ 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑥 − Ψ 𝜕Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑥 𝑑𝑥 𝜕 𝜕𝑡 ׬ 𝑃𝑑𝑥 = 𝑖ℏ 2𝑚 อΨ∗ 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑥 − Ψ 𝜕Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑥 −∞ ∞ = 0 The final step is because in order to be normalizable the wavefunction must go to zero at ±∞. THUS, IF THE WAVEFUNCTION IS A SOLUTION TO THE SE AND IS NORMALIZABLE, THEN PROBABILITY IS CONSERVED.

Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 8 In class activity (not to be handed in) • Evaluate the probability current for the wave function Ψ = 𝐴𝑒𝑖𝑘𝑥+𝜔𝑡 + 𝐵𝑒−𝑖𝑘𝑥+𝜔𝑡 • Each group should develop an answer and be prepared to present it to me. Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 9Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 10 Particles and waves: the Gaussian wavepacket We will simplify calculations by assuming that the spatial part of the wavefunction can be described at 𝑡 = 0 by a Normal Gaussian function centered at 𝑥0 and moving with average wavenumber 𝑘0; Ψ(𝑥, 0) = 1 𝜎𝑥 2𝜋 1/2 𝑒𝑖𝑘0𝑥𝑒−(𝑥−𝑥0)2/4𝜎𝑥 2. (We have already solved a similar problem in Notes 2. ) So 𝐴(𝑘) = 1 2𝜋 1 𝜎𝑥 2𝜋 1/2 න −∞ ∞ 𝑒𝑖(𝑘0−𝑘)𝑥𝑒−(𝑥−𝑥0)2/4𝜎𝑥 2𝑑𝑥 Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 11 Gaussian wavepacket continued to simplify further let′s take 𝑥0 = 0, so 𝐴(𝑘) = 1 2𝜋 1 𝜎𝑥 𝜋 1/2 න −∞ ∞ 𝑒𝑖(𝑘0−𝑘)𝑥𝑒−𝑥2/2𝜎𝑥 2𝑑𝑥 Then letting 𝑘′ = 𝑘 − 𝑘0, we solve by completing the square: −𝑖𝑘′𝑥 − 1 2𝜎𝑥 2 𝑥2 + 𝜎𝑥 2𝑘′2 − 𝜎𝑥 2𝑘′2 = 1 2𝜎𝑥 𝑥 − 𝑖𝜎𝑥𝑘′ 2 + 𝜎𝑥 2𝑘′2 𝐴(𝑘) = 1 2𝜋 1 𝜎𝑥 𝜋 1/2 𝑒−𝜎𝑥 2𝑘′2 න −∞ ∞ 𝑒− 1 2𝜎𝑥𝑥−𝑖𝜎𝑥𝑘′ 2𝑑𝑥 let 𝑥′ = 𝑥 2𝜎𝑥 − 𝑖𝜎𝑥𝑘′, then 𝐴(𝑘) = 1 2𝜋 1 𝜎𝑥 𝜋 1/2 2𝜎𝑥𝑒−𝜎𝑥 2𝑘′2 න −∞ ∞ 𝑒−𝑥′2𝑑𝑥′ 𝐴(𝑘) = 1 2𝜋 1 𝜎𝑥 𝜋 1/2 2𝜎𝑥𝑒−𝜎𝑥 2𝑘′2 𝜋 = 1 𝜋 𝜎𝑥 2 1 4 𝑒− 𝜎𝑥 2(𝑘−𝑘0)2 2 Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 12 Gaussian wavepacket continued 𝐴(𝑘) = 1 𝜋 𝜎𝑥 2 1 4 𝑒−𝜎𝑥 2(𝑘−𝑘0)2 2 This is a Normal Gaussian 𝑘 − distribution, centered at 𝑘0 with width 𝜎𝑘 = 1 𝜎𝑥 . • Although we specified a wave momentum 𝑘0 we find that the wavefunction actually contains a spread of wave momenta, 1 𝜎𝑥 , which increases as the spatial Gaussian narrows. Remember that Δ𝑘 = Δ𝑝 ℏ . • Waves of differing k move at different speeds, so the original wavefunction will spread with time. Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 13 Inversely correlated widths Note that if Ψ is properly normalized (නΨ∗ Ψ𝑑𝑥 = 1) then the wavevector amplitude function is also normalized to 1: න 𝐴(𝑘) 2𝑑𝑘 = 1 Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 14 An aside on the definition of the width of a Gaussian The width of a Gaussian can be defined in various ways. Two conventional ways are by the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) and twice the standard deviation. Morrison uses L=standard deviation of the position. Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 15 Time evolution of the wavefunction The general form of the wavefunction is: Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 1 2𝜋 න −∞ ∞ 𝐴(𝑘)𝑒−𝑖(𝑘𝑥−𝜔𝑡)𝑑𝑘. This means that if you are given Ψ(𝑥, 0) you can find Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡). 𝐴(𝑘) = 1 2𝜋 න −∞ ∞ Ψ(𝑥, 0)𝑒−𝑖(𝑘𝑥)𝑑𝑥. To do the top integral, you must know 𝜔(𝑘). The simplest case is for a pulse of light, 𝜔 = 𝑘𝑐 Ψ 𝑥, 𝑡 = 1 2𝜋 ׬−∞ ∞ 𝐴 𝑘 𝑒−𝑖𝑘 𝑥−𝑐𝑡 𝑑𝑘. which produces a travelling pulse that does not change shape as a function of time. Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 16 Group velocity for a wave-packet 𝜓(𝑥, 𝑡) = න𝐴(𝑘)𝑒−𝑖(𝑘𝑥−𝜔(𝑘)𝑡)𝑑𝑘 Assuming that 𝐴(𝑘) has a fairly narrow range of important 𝑘′s. we will allow ourselves to expand 𝜔(𝑘): 𝜔(𝑘) ≅ 𝜔(𝑘0) + 𝑘 − 𝑘0 𝑑𝜔 𝑑𝑘 𝑘0 +. . . Letting 𝑘′ = 𝑘 − 𝑘0 𝜓(𝑥, 𝑡) ≅ 𝑒𝑖(𝑘0𝑥−𝜔(𝑘0)𝑡 න𝑑𝑘′ 𝑒−𝑖𝑘′ 𝑥− 𝑑𝜔 𝑑𝑘 𝑡 0 Therefore in this simple expansion, the group velocity is just 𝑣𝑔 = 𝑑𝜔 𝑑𝑘 Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 17 Momentum Probability Amplitude Note that 𝐴(𝑘) clearly contains information about momentum because 𝑘 = 𝑝/ℏ. It is useful (later) to be able to describe the state function directly in terms of momentum states. Φ(𝑝) ≡ 1 ℏ 𝐴 𝑝 ℏ (the momentum probability amplitude) Then we can rewrite the wavefunction as; Ψ(𝑥, 0) = 1 2𝜋ℏ න −∞ ∞ Φ(𝑝)𝑒𝑖𝑝𝑥/ℏ𝑑𝑝 and Φ(𝑝) = 1 2𝜋ℏ න −∞ ∞ Ψ(𝑥, 0)𝑒−𝑖𝑝𝑥/ℏ𝑑𝑥. Note that the factor of 1/ ℏ is required for proper normailzation of Ψ and Φ. Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 18 Interpretation of the space and momentum state functions Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = the wavefunction and directly gives information about the probability of finding a particle at a specific position, but it is difficult to directly calculate properties like the expected momentum because momentum is not written as a function of position. Φ(𝑝) = the momentum probability amplitude and directly gives information about the probability of finding a particle with a specific momentum. They both describe the same quantum state. If the members of an ensemble are in the quantum state Ψ(x,t) with Fourier transform Φ(𝑝) = 𝐹 Ψ(𝑥, 0) then 𝑃(𝑝)𝑑𝑝 = Φ ∗ (𝑝)Φ(𝑝)𝑑𝑝 is the probability that in a momentum measurement at time 𝑡 a particle′s momentum will be found to be between 𝑝 and 𝑝 + 𝑑𝑝. Notes 4 PHYS 2210 - Spring 2024 - Class 4 19 Expectation values Given the momentum amplitude function and the associated probability distribution, we can compute expectation values: 𝑝 = න −∞ ∞ Φ(𝑝) ∗ 𝑝Φ(𝑝)𝑑𝑝 = expectation value (average) of p.
