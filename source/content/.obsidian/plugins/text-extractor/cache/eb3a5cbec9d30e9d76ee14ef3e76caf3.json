Age adjusted rates. Cancers are hard to treat and attain lower death rates. Major biopharma innovations in pipeline. Antibody and biologics treatments. Hope for larger improvements. Mortality Rates: Cardiovascular Age-adjusted cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates by sex, 1950 to 2014. *The comparability ratio 1.0502 was applied to the death rates reported in vital statistics for 1979 to 1998.

CHD indicates coronary heart disease; F: female; ICD, International Classification of Diseases; and M, male. https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309115 Causes of Death by Gender https://nchstats.com/2017/04/24/quickstats-number-of-deaths-from-10-leading- causes-by-sex-national-vital-statistics-system-united-states-2015/ Factors Influencing Demand • These include • Insurance system, premiums, copays, etc. • Patient willingness to pay • Patient need, but self-defined • Patient health status • Education • Physician factors • Demographic characteristics Demand for Medical Care Completely inelastic demand Insurance and Demand Generous health insurance will make demand for healthcare more inelastic Demand and SupplyPrice Elasticity of Demand • Calculating elasticities for health care is complicated and subject to considerable disagreement • Next two slides show that consumer demand is relatively inelastic • Low responsiveness to changes in the price of medical care and pharmaceuticals RAND Health Insurance Study • Randomly assigned 7,000 individuals to 14 different insurance plans and one HMO • Some plans had deductibles; others did not • Copayments ranged from 0%-95% with a max out-of-pocket of $1,000 per participant • Results: • Individual demand responds to cost sharing • Demand was 50% higher for those with free medical care than for those who paid 95% out of pocket Sample Price Elasticities (see column 6 only for estimates) Source: https://web.stanford.edu/~leinav/pubs/AEJPol2018.pdf E.g.: -0.23; inelastic demand.
