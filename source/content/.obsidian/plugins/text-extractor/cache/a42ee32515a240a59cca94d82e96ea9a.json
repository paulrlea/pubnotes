Methods for solving the math problem: Conductor Materials : Metals In conductors, e. g. metals, electrons move freely because at the microscopic level the valence band and the conduction band overlap. basic facts about conductors The static electric field E inside a conductor is 0 because the net electric charge density inside the conductor is 0. Any net electric charges will move to the conductor surface because they repel as a result of the Coulomb force. At equilibrium, charges are arranged such that the electrostatic potential energy of the system of charges is minimized.
