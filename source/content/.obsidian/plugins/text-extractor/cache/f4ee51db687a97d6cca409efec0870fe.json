The slope on the two sides is discontinuous due to the infinite 𝛿 function. ቤ 𝑑𝜓 𝑑𝑥 −𝛽 = 𝐾𝐴; ቤ 𝑑𝜓 𝑑𝑥 𝛽 = −𝐾𝐴; for small 𝛽, so ቤ 𝑑𝜓 𝑑𝑥 −𝛽 ቤ 𝑑𝜓 𝑑𝑥 𝛽 − ቤ 𝑑𝜓 𝑑𝑥 −𝛽 = −2𝐾𝐴; Returning to the Schrodinger equation, − ℏ 2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 𝜓 + 𝜆𝛿(𝑥)𝜓 = 𝐸𝜓 We integrate both sides once in x, from −𝛽 to +𝛽. − න −𝛽 𝛽 ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 𝜓𝑑𝑥 + න −𝛽 𝛽 𝜆𝛿(𝑥)𝜓𝑑𝑥 = න −𝛽 𝛽 𝐸𝜓𝑑𝑥 The rhs goes to zero as 𝛽 ⇒ 0 because the integrand is finite. 6 so, න −𝛽 𝛽 ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 𝜓𝑑𝑥 = න −𝛽 𝛽 𝜆𝛿(𝑥)𝜓𝑑𝑥 Doing both integrals separately, ℏ2 2𝑚 ቤ 𝜕𝜓 𝜕𝑥 −𝛽 𝛽 = 𝜆𝜓(0) and substituting ቤ 𝜕𝜓 𝜕𝑥 −𝛽 𝛽 = −2𝐴𝐾 (from the previous slide), we have − ℏ2𝐾 𝑚 = 𝜆 𝐾 = − 𝜆𝑚 ℏ2 ⇒ 𝐸 = ℏ2𝐾2 2𝑚 = − 𝑚𝜆2 2ℏ2 7 𝜓 𝑥 = A exp − 𝜆𝑚 ℏ2 |𝑥| is the only bound state. A Model Molecule We will use the Dirac Delta function as a simplified representation of an electron bound to an atom. We will address the case of an electron bound to a proton in a Coulomb potential later in this course. Consider two delta function potentials near one another. 8 2𝑚 ℏ2 𝑉 𝑥 = − 𝜆 𝑎 [𝛿 𝑥 − 𝑎 + 𝛿 𝑥 + 𝑎 ] Model Molecule Wavefunction Shape • We expect that the solution will look something like this:. 9 Model Molecule Wavefunction • Since 𝐸 < 𝑉 everywhere except for the two points a and –a, and the wavefunction must be normalizable, the solutions must be of the form: 𝜓 𝑥 = ൞ 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < −𝑎 𝐴 exp 𝐾𝑥 + 𝐵 exp −𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 − 𝑎 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 𝐷 exp −𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎 < 𝑥 • Where 𝐾 = 2𝑚 𝐸 ℏ2 • The lowest energy solution must be an even function, so C=D and A=B. 10 Model Wavefunction (2) Applying the symmetry conditions: 𝜓 𝑥 = ൞ 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < −𝑎 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 − 𝑎 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 𝐶 𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎 < 𝑥 Continuity at x=a yields: 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 = 𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑎 And the condition on the discontinuity in the derivative at x=a yields: −𝐾𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑎 − 𝐴𝐾 sinh 𝐾𝑎 = − 𝜆 𝑎 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 12 Putting the two conditions together: −𝐾𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 − 𝐴 sinh 𝐾𝑎 = − 𝜆 𝑎 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 And dividing by 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 tanh 𝐾𝑎 = 𝜆 𝑎 − 1 Which can be solved numerically. Here is a graphical representation to illustrate Where the dashed line is the energy for a single well. The particle has lower energy when bound to two wells near one another – binding. 13 The solution above yields the eigenstate energy and wavefunction for the ground state. This process can be repeated with the assumption that the eigenstate is odd about the center to search for a second state. It is not surprising that it is found that the odd state is at higher energy than the ground state. There are no other bound states. Discuss covalent bonding and LCAO. Discuss finding the kinetic energy expectation value.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
