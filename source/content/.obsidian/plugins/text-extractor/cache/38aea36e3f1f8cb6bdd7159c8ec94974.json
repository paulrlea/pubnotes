Its themes are embedded in the myriad beautiful connections among the physical concepts that govern the atomic and sub-atomic domain of matter. It is also a book about how these concepts manifest themselves in the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics. In practice, these formulas are tools for solving problems involving microscopic systems; by applying them to a host of such problems you can begin to gain \"quantum insight\" into the nature of reality as understood in modem physics . Such understanding amounts to nothing less than a new way of thinking about the universe . My goal in this book is to provide an in- depth introduction to the concepts of quantum physics and their practical implementation. Although definitely a physics text, this book contains several dol1ops of history, biography , and philosophy. I want you to appreciate that quantum physics is more than a col1ection of abstract laws and equations; it is a paradigm of reality at its most fundamental level, a paradigm with profound, provocative implications. And I want you to meet a few of the men and women who, early in the 20th century, created this towering intel1ectual achievement. So in these pages you 'll have a chance to read some of their words. I have tried to write a \" user-friendly\" textbook and an honest one. I have not dodged or hidden the difficulties of quantum mechanics or its applications. This is not Quantum Physics Made Simple-I don't believe quantum physics can be made simple. But I have tried to make it clear, sacrificing where necessary the elegance of brevity and rigor on the altar of clarity. Nor is this book Quantum Mechanics for Everybody. You'll need a finn foundation in freshman and sophomore physics (mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and thermo- dynamics), a solid working knowledge of calculus and algebra, and at least a passing acquaintance with the physics of waves. xv This book contains more material than one can cover in a single semester, so be selective in what you study. I and others who have used the book have found that by omitt ing some of the optional (starred) sections, undergraduates (at the junior level ) can cover Volume I in about 15 weeks . Since I began writing this book in 1981, many colleagues have asked, \"Why write another quantum mechanics text?\" A fair question. Neither the selection of topics nor their sequence in this book is particularly unconventional. But what I hope distinguishes it is its persistent emphasi s on comprehension of the fundamentals of quantum physic s and on how various aspects of this subject relate to one another, the sense in which quantum mechanics is a coherent intellectual structure. I care at least as much that you understand quantum mechanics as that you know how to use it to solve problems. Consequently Parts I and II focus on explaining and motivating the postulates that underlie the machinery of quantum mechanics. You can cover this material rather quickly, but do take time to think about it. The postulates are the heart and soul of quantum physics. Our first applications, in Part III, are simple single-particle systems in one dimension. Such problems highlight the essentials of quantum physics but avoid the mathematical clutter and complexity of three-dimensional systems. These are not mere pedantic exerci ses; research physici sts often use one-dimensional models to approximate real-world systems that are too complicated to solve or understand. So at the end of most chapters in Part III we'll take a look at such applications. In Volume II we 'll apply these fundamentals to the \"real world\" of three-dimensional, many-particle microscopic systems and will learn how to solve problems that are too dif- ficult to admit exact solution. There we'll take up approximation methods such as per- turbation theory and the variational method, three-dimensional properties such as orbital angular momentum, a new kind of angular momentum called spin, and many-particle systems, including atoms and molecules. In both volumes I have provided considerable structure to help you organize your study. In addition to the customary chapters, sections, and subsections, they contain all sorts of asides , footnotes , boxed results , tables of formulae, etc. Think of this book as a layer cake with several levels of flavor. The most important material is in the top layer, the text. In the asides and footnotes you 'll find all sorts of tasty morsels: supplementary information, extensions of material, suggested readings and references-things that would interrupt your train of thought were they in the text proper. The best source of advice about how to study a book is not the author . Several students who used this manuscript in preliminary form, suggest the following: Plan to go through each chapter several times. On your first reading, skip sections or subsections that seem difficult, plannin g to return to them later. The first time through, don't even read the asides and footnotes; come back to them also on subsequent readings. Above all, work the Questions , Exercises and Problems. The best advice I have ever read about how to study was written by the mathe- matician Paul R. Halmos in his \"autornathography\" I Want to Be A Mathematician (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1985), \"[Sjtudy actively. Don't just read [the text]: fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs .\" Halmos was writing about math, but his advice pertains as well to physic s. If you follow it, you will come away from this book with a solid, working knowledge of quantum physics; if you ignore it, the prospects are grim. You can no more learn quantum mechanics without practice than you could learn how to ride a bike, play a piano, or swim without riding, playing, or swimming. xvi Preface That's why you'll find in each chapter a host of Questions that will provoke you to think about the material and , at the end of each chapter, a wide selection of Exercises and Problems. Some of these anticipate material in subsequent chapters; others extend the content of the chapter you just read; still others provide opportunities to become familiar with new ideas through simple practice. I hope you will at least think through all the Questions and work all the Exercises. The Problems are a bit more challenging, but I've provided lots of help: most contain detailed directions, suggestions, helpful hints, etc. I cannot overemphasize the importance of your working as many of these as poss ible. You'll also find throughout the book a host of very detailed examples. Rather than simply work these examples, I've tried to show you how to approach them , how to figure out how to work them. Please don 't treat these as recipes in a cookbook. Rather, consider them as paradigms; each illustrates one of many possible ways to apply the principles you have studied. You will learn more and have more fun if instead of parroting what I do, you discover your own approaches to problem solving Of course, presenting examples in great detail takes a lot of space, and I've been able to include only a handful of the many useful illustrations of introductory quantum mechanics. So seek out others. Dig around in the many fine quantum books you'll find in your library (see the Bibliography at the end of this book) . Better yet, make up your own examples. Again , Halmos 's advice is invaluable: \"A good stock of examples, as large as possible, is indispensable for a thorough understanding of any concept, and when I want to learn something new, I make it my first job to build one.\" Each chapter also contains recommended readings, annotated lists of additional sources that will enhance your understanding and enjoyment of quantum physics. Please don 't ignore these recommendations. Reading several explanations of important topic s is good strategy for the study of any subject, but it's particularly important for quantum mechanics, which is so counter-intuitive that you need to see it from several vantage points. This book grew out of my desire to convey a sense of the fascination and beauty of quantum physics. This won 't be the only time you study this subject, nor should it be. Quantum mechanics is like a many -faceted jewel: every time you look at it you discover amazing new things . But I have the privilege of introducing the subject to you, so I particularly hope that this book communicates some of my enthusiasm for it. I believe that learning quantum physics can and should be a joyous activity. Although undeniably hard work , the study of quantum mechanics and its applications to atoms, molecules, solids, nuclei , and the whole rest of the microcosm can be a tremendously exciting intellectual adventure. Finally, I want to know what you think. I hope that , if you feel so inclined, you 'll write to me at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma 73019 with your opinions of this book, your reaction to quantum physics, any errors you find in the text, or any suggestions you have for improvement should there be a second edition. But for now, settle down in a comfortable chair, get out some scratch paper, and dig in. You are about to be plunged into the Marvelous. Michael A. Morrison Norman, Oklahoma Preface xvii Acknowledgments One of the great pleasures of finishing a book is thanking those who helped in its creation. First and foremost lowe a great intellectual debt to the mentors who have helped me learn how to think about quantum physics : my professors at Rice University, G. King Walters, Neal F. Lane, and Thomas L. Estle, and my long-time friend and colleague Dr. Lee A. Collins. My other mentors I know only through their works . Like most later- generation textbooks, mine is in part a mosaic of variations on the best of what I have found in many sources, primarily in the vast library of quantum mechanics texts that preceded this one . I have acknowledged these sources collectively in the Bibliography at the end of this book and, where memory served, in footnotes to the text. Closer to home, I am grateful to my fellow faculty members in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Oklahoma. During the many years since I began work on this book, they have consistently tolerated, encouraged, and supported me. In particular, Drs. Robert Petry, Thomas Miller, Deborah Watson, and Gregory Parker used various incarnations of this manuscript in classes and provided valuable feedback and brickbats. And Drs. Miller, Parker, Jack Cohn , Ryan Doezema, and Suzanne Willis read portions of the manuscript for technical accuracy. Students played a crucial role in the latter stages of work on this book . I have tested all or part of the manuscript in five courses. Although space precludes my thanking all of the long-suffering students in those classes, I must single out a few-Thomas Haynes , Brian Argrow, Jose Rodriguez, Bok-hyun Yoon, and Bryan Biegel-for their extraordinary efforts on behalf of this project. Three graduate students, Wayne Trail , Bill Isaacs, and Brian Elza, carefully read the manuscript in proof and found errors I would not have believed were still in it. Finally , I'm indebted to three colleagues, Drs. Ron Olowin, Richard Henry , and Sheridan Simon , who provided solace and suggestions during our eleventh-hour search for a new title. xvIII I and this book also benefited from the advice of a number of outside reviewers, including Drs. Robert Hallock , Sheridan Simon , John L. Stevens , Sanford Kern, H. A. Gersh, Stephan Estreicher, and Robert Silbey. Thanks folks: I didn 't adopt all your suggestions, but I considered each one carefully. Preparing this manuscript for production would have been impossible had it not been for superb technical help from two sources. Ms. Johnette Ellis provided assistance beyond the call of duty during the trying end-game months of the summer of 1987. And my wife Mary, who does not share my fondness for physics , nevertheless proofread this entire , vast manuscript. Finally, I must acknowledge the staff at Prentice Hall and the physics editors with whom I worked on this project: Logan Campbell, who initiated it; Doug Humphrey, who served as midwife and father confessor through the long years of its evolution; and Holly Hodder, who saw the final manuscript into production. Most of all, I'm grateful to my production editor, Debra Wechsler, whose care, concern, and oversight has helped immeasurably to make this the book I envisioned when I started .

I wish to guide you on an excursion which is long and rather difficult but worth the trouble, so I am going to climb ahead of you, slowly. -Golem's Inaugural Lecture in ImaginaryMagnitude by Stanislaw Lem How does the universe work? What are the principles that underlie natural phenomena? Philosophers have pondered such questions for millennia; their answers reflect the world view of Western civilization-how we perceive ourselves in relation to the universe. In the early years of this century the dominant world view was determinism , a tenet that had its origins in the philosophical musings of Descartes. Descartes' metaphor for the universe was a gigantic clockwork machine, a Rube Goldberg device that grinds relentlessly onward, towards eternity. According to this interpretation, the future is preordained and fully predictable. All of existence is described precisely by physical laws, and, in principle, can be known by man. Nature, however, had a surprise in store for philosophers. In the first decades of the twentieth century, they were to see this world view subverted, uprooted , and toppled by a young upstart physical theory called quantum mechanics. Theoretical physics has come a long way since those fateful days in the 1920's and 30 's when physicists were taking the first tentative steps towards a radical new definition of reality . So far have we come that in 1981 the physicist Steven Hawking could reasonably predict that! . .. by the end of the century . .. we might have a complete, consistent, and unified theory of the physical interactions which would describe all possible observations. The foundation of that unified theory is quantum mechanics, the subject matter of this book. What is quantum mechanics? You probably know that if you want to understand how a transistor works or the principles behind the laser in your compact disc player you'd better not use classical physics . Newton 's mechanics and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can explain macroscopic phenomena, such as the motion of billiard balls or rockets, but fail spectacularly when applied to microscopic phenomena, such as proton- atom scattering or the flow of electrons in a semiconductor. An understanding of such processes requires a better mousetrap: quantum mechanics. More precisely, quantum mechanics is a collection of postulates based on a huge number of experimental observations, and the tools derived from those postulates. We use these tools to analyze, predict, and understand microscopic phenomena. Hence quantum theory forms the bedrock of the modem physics of matter-atoms, molecules, and solids-and is at the core of such diverse sciences as astrophysics and biochemistry. In its more pragmatic guises, quantum mechanics plays a vital role in a vast array of technological applications, some of which we use every day-e .g., the microchips in the computer on which I am writing this chapter. lIn an article optimistically entitled \"Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?\" [Phys. Bull. 32, 15 (1981)) . 2 Chap. 1 Introductory Thus, in one form or another, quantum physics pervades the life of everyone in our high-tech world. Discussing the importance of quantum mechanics to non-physicists, Heinz R. Pagels has written/ When the history of this century is written, we shall see that political events-in spite of their immense cost in human lives and money-will not be the most influential events. Instead the main event will be the first human contact with the invisible quantum world and the subsequent biological and computer revolutions. You are about to make contact with the quantum world. In this chapter, we'll ease into this bizarre world, beginning in Â§ 1.1 with a short review of the structure of classical mechanics. We'll also see the way in which that structure supported the deterministic ideas of philosophers of the early 1900's. Then in Â§ 1.2 we'll take a whirlwind tour of the world according to quantum physics, focusing on some of the new ideas that so devastated the Newtonian view. This chapter and the next provide a bird's eye view of quantum theory; in them , we'll examine qualitatively the central ideas of this theory. Then, beginning in Chap. 3, we'll set off on our voyage of discovery, formulating these notions mathematically and applying them to the denizens of the microscopic universe. 1.1 THE CLASSICAL POINT OF VIEW Consider Newtonian mechanics. In their simplest form, the laws of classical mechanics are written in terms of particle trajectories. So the trajectory underlies the structure of classical physics, and the particle underlies its model of physical reality . We start with these basic elements. Particles and Their Trajectories Physicists, classical or otherwise, study the universe by studying isolated fragments of it. These little chunks of existence are called systems: classical physics pertains to macroscopic systems, quantum physics to microscopic systems.' A system, then, is just a collection of particles that interact among themselves via internal forces and that may interact with the world outside via external fields. To a classical physicist, a particle is an indivisible mass point possessing a variety of physical properties that can be measured. In physical theory , measurable quantities are called observables. By listing the values at any time of the observables of a particle, we can specify its state. (The trajectory is an equivalent, more convenient way to specify a particle 's state.) The state of the system is just the collection of the states of the particles comprising it. Aside: Extrinsic versus Intrinsic Properties. Classical physicists often characterize properties of a particle as intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic properties don't depend on 2The Cosmic Code: Quantum Physics as the Language of Nature (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1982), page 98. 3The validity of partitioning the universe into systems for the convenience of scientists is discussed in Chap. 4 of The Origin of Knowledge and the Imagination by J. Bronowski (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978). Sec. 1.1 The Classical Point of View 3 the particle's location, don't evolve with time, and aren't influenced by its physical environment; rest mass and charge are intrinsic properties. Extrinsic properties, on the other hand, evolve with time in response to the forces on the particle; position and momentum are extrinsic properties. According to classical physics, all properties, intrinsic and extrinsic, of a particle could be known to infinite precision . For example, we could measure the precise val- ues of the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. Of course, precise knowledge of everything is a chimera-in the real world, neither measuring apparatus nor experimental technique is perfect, and experimental errors bedevil physicists as they do all scientists. But in principle both are perfectible: that is, our knowledge of the physical universe is limited only by ourselves , not by nature. How does a classical theorist predict the outcome of a measurement? He uses trajectories.\" The trajectory of a single particle consists of the values of its position and momentum at all times after some (arbitrary) initial time t o:5 {r(t) , p(t) ; t ~ to}, trajectory where the (linear) momentum is, by definition, d p(t) =m dtr(t) = mv(t) , (1.1) (1.2) (1.3) with m the mass of the particle . Trajectories are the \"state descriptors\" of Newtonian physics . To study the evolu- tion of the state represented by the trajectory (1.1), we use Newton's Second Law, d2 m dt2r(t) = -Y'V(r, t), where V (r, t) is the potential energy of the particle.\" To obtain the trajectory for t > to, we need only know V (r,t ) and the initial conditions, the values of rand p at the initial time to- With the trajectory in hand, we can study various properties of the particle in the state that the trajectory describes, e.g., its energy or orbital angular momentum. Notice that classical physics tacitly assumes that we can measure the initial condi- tions without altering the motion of the particle-e.g., that in measuring the momentum of the particle , we transfer to it only a negligible amount of momentum.\" Thus the scheme of classical physics-which is illustrated in Fig. I. I-is based on precise specification of the position and momentum of a particle. I do not mean to imply by this cursory description that classical physics is easy. Solving the equations of motion for a system with lots of particles interacting among 4This is, of course, a gross oversimplification. For a closer look at Newtonian physics, see Herbert Goldstein's classic text Classical Mechanics. now in its second edition (Reading, Mass. : Addison-Wesley, 1983). 5Conventionally, we think of a trajectory as a path in geometrical space . In classical physics, however . a trajectory is usually taken to mean a path in \"phase space\" defined by the position and momentum at all times t ~ to. 6 As written. Eq. (1.3) is valid for conservative forces, i.e.â€¢ ones that do not depend on the velocity v. Recall that the force is related to the potent ial energy by F = -V V (r,t ). 7To determine p(to) we must measure v(to) . This quantity is the rate of change of position, so to measure it we must observe r(t) at two nearby times-say, to and to + ilt, mak ing the (known) time increment ilt as small as our apparatus will allow . Such position measurements necessarily entail a change in the particle's momentum , but this effect is insignificant for a macroscopic particle. 4 Chap. 1 Introductory Particle masses Forces on and between part icles Init ial conditions at to Trajectories {r;(t) , p;(t) ; t;;;' to} for all part icles Figure 1.1 The Newtonian Universe Grinder. Fed the proper information, the great machine of classical mechanics can predict the future of the universe. This machine is now obsolete. themselves or exposed to complicated external fields is a formidable task. Contemporary applications of Newtonian mechanics to problems like celestial mechanics (the motion of the planets in our solar system) require massive computers and budgets to match. At worst, one may be unable, using present technology, to solve these equations. The important point is that in principle, given sufficient time and scratch paper, we could predict from the initial positions and momenta of all particles the precise future behavior of any system-indeed, of the entire universe. That's the classical view. The Determinate Universe The underlying assumptions and philosophical implications of classical physics are so familiar that you may have never given them a second thought. For example, classical physics ascribes to the universe an objective reality, an existence external to and inde- pendent of human observers. This assumption reassures us that when we do research in physics we are studying what is actually \"out there,\" beyond and distinct from our consciousness, and that we can design experiments that do not affect in any significant way the systems they measure. That is, in an objective universe we can control the interaction between the observer and the observed and, if clever enough, can make this interaction negligibly weak. Our other central assumption about the nature of the classical universe is that it's predictable: knowing the initial conditions of the constituents of any system, however complicated, we can use Newton's Laws to predict its future. Precisely, without am- biguity or uncertainty. This notion is the essence of determinism, which, supported by Newtonian mechanics, dominated philosophical thinking until the advent of quantum theory. Sec. 1.1 The Classical Point of View 5 If the universe is determinate, then for every effect there must be a cause. After all, if all events, all phenomena can be predicted and explained precisely by physics, then it must be possible to backtrack from any event to find, somewhere in the dim recesses of history , its cause. We may have to look long and hard-the bird that just fell off a tree limb outside my window may have been influenced by an event during the Peloponnesian wars-but somewhere there is a cause. Or so says the principle of causality. Causality was an important element of nineteenth century philosophy. It had im- portant implications for physicists of that era, for it guaranteed the reproducibility of experiments-i.e., that two identical systems with the same initial conditions (i.e., in the same state) subject to the same measurement will yield identical results. Same causes: same effects. Very neat and tidy. I suppose the deterministic world view implied by Newtonian mechanics could, even today, seem comforting, for it implies that the universe can be understood fully and dealt with rationally. But it has a dark side. For example, if the universe is ruled by causality, then free will is a meaningless concept, for the universe is a vast, mindless machine that controls our every action, our every decision . Everything that happens happens because of something that happened in the past, not because we chose to make it happen. According to this view, if you \"decide\" to get married or to take a job or to collect water buffalo, you do so not by choice but because of past events. In such a universe, our loves, hopes, and dreams are but delusions, hiding the grim reality that we are but cogs in Descartes' clockwork machine . Goals are irrelevant; human aspirations pointless. Thus determinism is a dehumanizing philosophy. It describes a universe that is infinitely predictable, holding few surprises. All can be known ; nothing is unexpected. Determinism is boring. It is also wrong. 1.2 THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS: THE QUANTUM POINT OF VIEW We shall be plunged normally into the marvelous. -Noel Arnaud We have seen that Newtonian mechanics is constructed from particle trajectories. One reason classical physics fails when applied to microscopic systems is that the constituents of such systems are not particles in the classical sense of the word. Moreover, they do not have trajectories . Thus to understand the physics of the microworld-that is, to understand the results of experiments on microscopic particles-we must radically revise our conceptual description of a particle. When Is a Particle Not a Particle? In describing the quantum world, we must abandon the classical notion of a particle as an indivisible mass point with an independent existence and well-defined, measurable extrinsic properties. Whatever microscopic entities are, they are certainly not indivisible 6 Chap. 1 Introductory mass points. We can verify this assertion in the laboratory. In suitably designed experi- ments quantum \"particles\" act like classical particles-appearing, for example, as spots on a screen. But in other experiments their transit through space is like that of a wave, manifesting behavior such as diffraction and interference, as though they were diffuse wave fronts (see Â§2.5). This apparently contradictory behavior is a manifestation of the wave-particle duality that characterizes the domain where quanta dwell. In our study of duality in Chap. 2, we'll see why it poses such a challenge to the student of quantum physics: it renders useless the conventional mental images with which we visualize physical phenomena. Thus, an atomic electron is not a tiny \"planet\" orbiting a \"nuclear sun,\" as in the Rutherford and Bohr models of the atom. But neither is it a \"fuzzy\" thing, smeared out over a region of space, as it is portrayed in many introductory physics texts. The electron is something else, neither particle nor wave but eerily reminiscent of both.s The dual nature of subatomic particles subverts the classical concept of a particle. But the true nature of microscopic entities is even more nebulous than is implied by wave-particle duality, for the properties of quantum particles are not, in general, well- defined until they are measured. In a sense, the physical properties of electrons, protons, and the like are \"potential\" orvlatent\" properties until an experimenter-a macroscopic being-performs a measurement (see Chap. 5). You will encounter this disquieting aspect of quantum mechanics if you ask a quantum physicist to predict the value you would obtain were you to measure, say, the position of an electron in a metal. He cannot give you a definite answer, even if he knows fully the state of the electron just prior to the proposed measurement. The inability of quantum theory to provide precise answers to such simple questions is not a deficiency of the theory; rather it is a reflection of its essential nature. We can see this if we look at how quantum mechanics specifies the state of a particle. Unlike a classical state, a quantum state is a conglomeration of several possible outcomes of measurement of physical properties. At most, quantum physicists can tell you only the possible outcomes and the probability that you will obtain one or another of them. Quantum mechanics is expressed in the language of probabilities, not certainties. (A grammar of this new language appears in Chap. 3.) It is inherently statistical in nature, describing not definite results of a measurement on an individual system, but rather possible results of measurements on a large number of identical systems. What, then, controls what actually happens in a particular measurement--e.g., which of the possible values of position a particle exhibits when we measure this quantity? Random chance. Of course, were we to carry out a position measurement on a single particle, we would get a single value. So immediately after the measurement, we can meaningfully talk about the position of the particle-its position is the number we got in the mea- surement. But what about immediately before the measurement? According to quantum mechanics, the particle does not then have a position. Rather, its position prior to mea- surement is latent-a mere possibility, waiting to be made actual. Thus by the act of measurement, we change the state of the particle from one in which it is characterized by a plethora of possible positions to one in which it has a single, well-defined position. Clearly, measurement will playa more vital role in quantum 8Nonetheless, we persist in refening to subatomic whatevers as \"particles.\" (To avoid an excrescence of punctuation, we leave off the quote marks.) The distinguished physicist Sir Arthur Eddington once suggested the term wavicles for quantum particles. Perhaps fortunately, the word never caught on. Sec. 1.2 The Quantum Point of View 7 physics than in classical physics. When we study the microworld, experimentation is not just a way of discovering the nature of external reality, but rather is a way of creating certain aspects of reality! In contrast to the assumptions of classical physics, an observer cannot observe a microscopic system without altering some of its properties. Intrinsically indeterminate interactions between the observer and the observed are an inevitable feature of the quantum universe, one that applies not just to position, but to all properties of microscopic particles. Some physicists believe that we macroscopic observers \"create\" the microscopic building blocks of the universe by actualizing via measurement their various physical properties. This interaction is unavoidable: the effect of the observer on the observed cannot be reduced to zero, in principle or in practice. This fact, which is reflected in the mathematical structure of quantum theory and has been verified by countless experiments, demolishes the philosophical notion of an objective universe, the idea that what we study in physics is necessarily a \"real world\" external to and independent of our perceptions.\" The observer-observed interaction is also uncontrollable. Although we can be sure that when we measure the properties of a microscopic particle we will change its state, we can neither predict nor influence precisely how the state will be changed. Random chance determines that. In fact, randomness governs microscopic phenomena even when man is not study- ing them. A famous example of this seeming perversity of nature is radioactive decay of an atom. Quantum mechanics prohibits us from predicting precisely when a particular atom will decay, emitting radiation. At most, we can determine the probability that it will decay in a given time interval. The role of randomness in microscopic physical processes shatters the illusion that the universe is deterministic, The Decline and Fall of the Trajectory So much for the idea of using the classical model of a particle to describe a microscopic entity. But can we salvage the basic state descriptor of classical physics, the trajectory? The first step in determining the trajectory of a particle is measuring its initial conditions , x (to) and Px(to).10 To determine the accuracy of our results, we would perform such a measurement not on just one particle, but on a large number of identical particles, all in the same state.11 Each individual measurement yields a value for x and a value for Px (subject to experimental uncertainties) . But the results of different measurements are not the same, even though the systems are identical. If graphed, these results are seen to fluctuate about a central peak, as illustrated in Fig. 1.2. (A similar spread of results characterizes measurement of the y- or z- components of position and momentum.) At first, the fact that the results of many identical experiments are not the same doesn't worry us; we think it's just a manifestation of the experimental error that bedevils 911 also gives rise to a host of fascinating metaphysical questions: Do pan icles exist if their properties are not being measured? Is what we study in physics reality or merely our perceptions of reality? What are the implications of quantum theory for the existence of God? With some regret, I'll not discuss these questions in this text. lUActually, we have to measure all three Cartesian component s of position and momentum: x (t o), y(t o), z (to ), and Px(to ), py(to), pz(to). But I can make my point by considering only the x components. 11 Such an aggregate of identical systems in the same stale is called an ensemble, a concept you'll meet formally in Chap. 3. 8 Chap. 1 Introductory I I I I I I I I I I t..x (a) x (b) p Figure 1.2 The results of measurement of the x components of the position and mo- mentum of a large number of identical quantum particles. Each plot shows the number of experiments that yield the values on the abscissa. Results for each component are seen to fluctuate about a central peak, the mean value. all measurements. According to classical physics, we can reduce the errors in x and Px to zero and thereby determine precisely the initial conditions. But we cannot unambiguously specify the values of these observables for a micro- scopic particle. This peculiarity of nature in the microscopic realm is mirrored in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP). In its simplest form, the HUP shows that any attempt to simultaneously measure x(to) and Px(to) necessarily introduces an impreci- sion in each observable.F No matter how the experiment is designed, the results are inevitably uncertain, and the uncertainties .D.x(to) and .D.Px(to), which are measures of fluctuations like those in Fig. 1.2, cannot be reduced to zero. Instead , their product must satisfy the condition (see Chap. 4) where h is Planck's Constant (See Chap. 2) h == 6.626 X 10- 34 J-sec. (1.4) (1.5) Not a very big number, but not zero either. [Similar constraints apply to the pairs of uncertainties .D.y(to), .D.Py(to) and ~z(to), ~P%(to).] Position and momentum are fundamentally incompatible observables, in the sense that knowing the precise value of one precludes knowing anything about the other. But there is a deeper dimension to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Quantum theory reveals that the limitation reflected by Eq. (1.4) on our ability to simultaneously 12you are probably familiar with one illustration of this principle: the gamma-ray microscope. This experiment is discussed in almost all lower-level modem physics texts as a gedanken (thought) experiment. But today, with the advent of electron microscopes, it is a reality. See B. G. William, Amer. Jour . Phys., 52, 435 (1984). Sec. 1.2 The Quantum Point of View 9 measure x and Px is implicit in nature. It has nothing to do with a particular apparatus or with experimental technique. Quantum mechanics proves that a particle cannot si- multaneously have a precise value of x and a precise value of Px . Indeed, in Chap. 4 we'll derive the HUP from first principles. Similar uncertainty principles constrain our ability to measure other pairs of incom- patible observables. But uncertainty relations such as (1.4) are not veiled criticisms of experimental physicists. They are fundamental limitations on knowledge: the universe is inherently uncertain. Man cannot know all of existence. We might think of uncertainty relations as nature's way of restraining our ambitions. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle strikes at the very heart of classical physics: the trajectory. Obviously, if we cannot know the position and momentum of a particle at to we cannot specify the initial conditions of the particle and hence cannot calculate its trajectory. Indeed, since the HUP applies at any time, it makes no sense to ascribe a trajectory to a microscopic particle. We are forced, however reluctantly, to conclude that microscopic particles do not have trajectories. But once we throw out trajectories, we must also jettison Newton's Laws. And there goes the ball game: stripped of its basic elements and fundamental laws, the whole structure of classical physics collapses. The demise of classical physics occurred around 1930. Sitting amidst the rubble, physicists of that era realized that their only alternative (other than to change careers) was to rebuild-to construct from scratch a new physical theory, one based on elements other than trajectories and on laws other than those of Newton and Maxwell. Thus began the quantum revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Classical and Quantum Physics Get Together To say that classical physics died around 1930 is a bit too dramatic. The physics of Newton and Maxwell still accurately and beautifully describes the macroscopic world. Knowing this, physicists developing quantum mechanics demanded that when applied to macroscopic systems, the new physics must reduce to the old physics. Thus, as the size of the system being studied increases, the quantum laws of motion (which we'll discover in Chap. 6) must go over smoothly into those of Newtonian mechanics, and non-classical phenomena such as uncertainty and duality must become undetectable. Neils Bohr codified this requirement into his Corresponden ce Principle, the essential elements of which are sketched in Fig. 1.3. We shall return to this principle repeatedly, since the ability of quantum mechanics to satisfy it is an important theoretical justification of the new physics. _10- 10 m (atoms. molecules) >0.01 m (us, etc .) â€¢ Ouantum Classical physics ---------- phys ics Laws Physical models Predictions Figure 1.3 The rudiments of the Correspondence Principle. the theoretical link between the microworld and the macroworld . 10 Chap. 1 Introductory The experimental justification of quantum theory is that it works. The predictions, qualitative and quantitative, of quantum mechanics have been verified by a host of experiments on a diverse collection of systems. These verifications are of paramount importance to physics, for in some ways quantum theory is a fragile creation. It is an inferential theory, in which we devise a handful of postulates (see Part II) and from them derive equations, which can then be put to the test of experimental justification. If the equations pass this test, then we have confidence that the postulates, which cannot be directly tested, are correct. But it would take only one repeatable experiment whose results confounded the equations of quantum mechanics to bring the whole structure tumbling down. To date, the edifice stands. Quantum mechanics remains the only theory we have to explain how matter is constructed and how physical processes at the atomic level work. The Indeterminate Universe As this whirlwind overview may suggest, the new physics, quantum physics, differs from classical physics in nearly every way imaginable-from its elements and laws to the kind of knowledge it provides. It is in this last respect that the implications of the quantum revolution are most profound. Classical physics yields precise information about the properties and behavior of individual, independent systems. It holds out to the scientist the promise that, in principle at least, he can know everything. Quantum physics says that this is just not so, that nature imposes fundamental limitations on knowledge, constraints such as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. These limitations derive from the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. The new physics yields only statistical information about aggregates of identical systems. It is mute about the behavior of individual systems. Moreover, the statistical information provided by quantum theory is limited to the results of measurements. 13 That is, quantum physicists are not allowed to infer facts about a system unless these facts could be verified by experiment. This is a severe limitation-for example, it prohibits us from ascribing an orbit (a path) to a particle, because measurements of position are necessarily performed at discrete times (see Â§ 2.5). Even if we measure the position of a particle at two very nearby times, t 1 and t2, we cannot even make the simple inference that it traveled from r(tt} to r(t2) via a path in geometric space; we can only say that we found it at r(tt} at tl and then at r(t2) at t 2 â€¢ This limitation, that physics describes only observed phenomena, forces us to think about reality in a strange, new way. At its most fundamental level, reality seems to be discontinuous. Here is Erwin Schrodinger, the father of quantum mechanics, on this most non-classical feature of his theory: . . . it is better to regard a particle not as a permanent entity but as an instanta- neous event. Sometimes these events form chains that give the illusion of permanent beings--but only in particular circumstance and only for an extremely short period of time in every single case. Quantum physics is a harsh taskmaster. 131n the words of one textbook author: Thou shalt not make any statement that can never he verified. [R. G. Winter, Quantum Physics (Belmont, Ca.: Wadsworth, 1979Â»). Sec. 1.2 The Quantum Point of View 11 In closing, I should note that alI this has not set welI with many physicists. Even today, some find the world view implied by quantum mechanics-a subjective universe, acausal and i:-!detenninate, where the knowledge accessible to man is limited-to be intolerably offensive. And the battle over the interpretation of quantum mechanics goes on. (You'll find accounts of minor skirmishes in Parts II and IV of this book.) But alI agree on the usefulness of the theory for predicting and understanding the physics of matter. It is, after all, the only game in town. 1.3 FINAL THOUGHTS: WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? From the overview in Â§ 1.2, you may have concluded that quantum mechanics is not a particularly easy subject. 'Tis true; to pretend otherwise would be deceitful. But why is learning quantum mechanics hard? There are, I think, three reasons. First, we grew up in and now inhabit a macro- scopic world. Our intuition-o ur sense of how things ought to behave-has been rein- forced every waking minute by experiences in a world that abides by classical physics. Moreover, as students of physics, our intuition has been deepened and further reinforced by our study of classical physics. Quantum physics is an affront to that intuition. To understand it, to use it effectively, we must develop a new way of thinking about the way things work, because, as Richard P. Feynman has wriuen.!\" Things on a very small scale behave like nothing you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen. Second, quantum physics operates at a level that is one step removed from reality. It is more abstract than classical physics. While classical physicists can deal with well- defined trajectories that describe particles they can visualize, quantum physicists must forever wander through a haze of uncertainty, probabilities, and indeterminacy, trying to understand a universe they cannot directly observe. The microcosm can be understood, but it cannot be seen. Third, quantum mechanics is inherently mathematical. There is an important dis- tinction here between classical and quantum physics. In classical physics we use math- ematical methods to implement the ideas of the theory, but we can discuss those ideas without recourse to mathematics. This is not possible with quantum mechanics. Notwith- standing the achievements of writers who have recently tried to popularize quantum theory-several of whose books I have included in this chapter 's Selected Reading list- I believe it is impossible to fully grasp the principles of quantum theory without seeing them expressed mathematically. Math is more than a tool for solving quantum mechanics problems: mathematics is the language of quantum physics. As we move deeper into quantum theory, we'll see physics and math become inextricably intertwined. Thus quan- tum physics demands that we think in a new, abstract, inherently mathematical way-no easy task. 141n Volume III of The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1965). Only the third volume of Feynman's lecture series is devoted to quantum mechanics, but 1 strongly recommend the whole series to every serious student of physics. 12 Chap. 1 Introductory Finally, we must re-think and redefine many familiar words and concepts, and when we use these words to discuss quantum concepts, we must do so with great care and precision. Familiar terms such as \"particle\" and \"motion\" assume in the quantum domain subtle overtones and shades of meaning that we ignore at our peril. We have already seen an example of this in our discussion in Â§ 1.2 of the \"position\" of a microscopic particle. The \"position\" of a quantum particle prior to its measurement is not a single, well-defined number, such as IO.7m. Rather it must be specified as a collection of several-maybe an infinity of-values, none of which represent the position of the particle. Instead, each value represents a possibility, a location at which the particle might be found. In spite of these roadblocks-our classical intuition, the inherently abstract, math- ematical nature of quantum mechanics, and the need to use old words in new ways-I believe that you can understand quantum physics. Even if you cannot visualize what goes on in the microworld of atoms and molecules, you can grasp the beautiful and powerful physical laws that govern that world. After all, countless physicists have done it. This is our world. And welcome to it.

The diameter of an atom in its ground state is roughly 1 A. Suppose we want to locate an electron in an atom; to do so using a microscope would require us to use radiation of wavelength A ~ 1 A. (a) From the wavelength of a photon , we can calculate its momentum using the de Broglie relation [see Eq. (2.16)] p = h/A. Calculate the momentum of a photon corresponding to a wavelength of 1 A. (b) Suppose a photon with momentum p collides with the atomic electron. The amount of momentum transferred from the photon to the electron lies somewhere in the range from oto p. Consequently, the electron is left with a momentum uncertainty !:J.p. What is !:J.p for the electron in this problem? 14 Chap. 1 Introductory (c) Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, calculate how accurately you could deter- mine the position of the electron in the atom . What does this calculation tell you about the advisability of using a microscope to try to \"locate\" an electron in an atom? 1.2 Time Evolution of Uncertainty. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Eq. (1.4) relates the uncertainties in the position and momentum of quantum particles at a particular time. But what happens to these uncertainties as time passes? To answer this question rigorously, we would need quantum mechanical machinery that we won't learn until Part IV, but with our present knowledge we can get a rough idea based on a semi-classical analysis. IS Consider a beam of identical microscopic particles of mass m. The particles are free, i.e., they move (at a non-relativistic velocity) in the absence of extemal forces. For simplicity's sake, we'll consider only motion in one dimension, -00 < x < +00. Suppose the position of a particle at an initial time to = 0 is known to within an uncertainty ~xo about xo, and the initial momentum to within ~po about Po. (a) How accurately can we determine the velocity at to? (b) Write down a classical expression for x(t), the position at time t ~ to , assuming that the position at to is Xo and the momentum at this time is po. Express your answer in terms of xo, the initial velocity vo, and t. (c) Of course, the position at to is unknown to within the uncertainty ~xo, and the momen- tum to within ~po. From your answer to [bl, determine upper and lower bounds on x(t) . (d) Now, derive an expression for ~x(t) in terms of ~xo, h, m, and t . (e) Suppose we work very hard to determine the position at to to great precision, so that ~xo Â« 1. What are the consequences of all this effort for our knowledge of the position at some time t > to? 1.3 The Energy-Time Uncertainty Relation. Consider a beam of microscopic free particles, each of mass m, traveling along the x axis. In this chapter we noted the uncertainty relation (1.4) ( 1.3.1) This relation expresses the limitation nature imposes on our ability to measure simultaneously the position and momentum of the particle. There is another uncertainty relation (which we shal1 study in Â§11.8), the energy-time uncertainty relation: ~E~t~ ~1i. (1.3.2) In the energy-time relation, ~t is the time required to measure the energy E of a system. and ~E is the uncertainty in the resulting value. In effect, this relation says that to measure an energy exactly would take forever. Since the energy and momentum of a free particle are related, we should expect these uncertainty relations to be related. Derive the energy-time uncertainty relation (1.3.2) from the position-momentum uncertainty relation (1.3.1). Be sure to explain or justify each step of your derivation. (Consider very smal1 uncertainties ~E and ~1).) Hint: If the particle moves through a distance ~x in a time interval ~t, then ~x = (p/m )~t. 15 A semi-cla ssical analysis is one in which classical physics is discretely and carefully used for cenain aspects of a quantum problem. Applied correctly. sem i-classical techniques can yield accurate approximations to a full quantal analysis . Applied indiscriminately or without thought. they can yield utter garbage. Caveat emptor. Exercises and Problems 15 1.4 Revenge of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. A locomotive engine is at rest in a train yard. The locomotive is macroscopic, so we can see that it is at rest and where it is-i.e., we know its position with certainty. Suppose we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to estimate the position uncertainty ~x. Consider the following argument: Since the engine is at rest, its momentum p is zero. Moreover, since ~p = 0, the uncertainty in its position is infinite. Therefore the position of the locomotive is completely unknown . It would seem that the HUP has let us down, for it has led to a conclusion that directly contradicts the experience of our own eyes. Find the flaw in the above argument. Problems 1.1 Testing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. An ambitious undergraduate decides to check out the uncertainty principle for macroscopic systems. He goes to the top of the University clock tower and drops a marble (of mass m) to the ground, trying to hit one of the (many) cracks in the pavement beneath him. To aim his marble, he teeters precariously directly over the desired crack and uses a very sophisticated apparatus of the highest possible precision, which he has borrowed from one of the superbly equipped freshman physics laboratories. (a) Alas, try as he might, the student cannot hit the crack. Prove that the marble will inevitably miss the crack by an average distance of the order of [hl(21rm)l~(HIg)t, where 9 is the acceleration due to gravity and H is the height of the tower. (b) Assuming reasonable values for H and m , evaluate the order of magnitude of the dist.ance in part (a) in MKS units. (c) Discuss your result in terms of the Correspondence Principle. 1.2 No Rest for the Weary (in the Microworld). One of the most extraordinary features of microscopic systems is that if they are bound (i.e., confined by forces) they can never be at rest. The explanation for this bizarre fact, as for so many bizarre features of the microworld, is related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The state of minimum total energy of a system is its ground state. The ground-state energy of a system is its zero-point energy. Consider a beam of particles of mass m moving in one dimension. Suppose their potential energy is that of a simple harmonic oscillator of natural frequency wo, 1 2 2 V(x) = 2mwox . Use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to derive an approximate expression for the ground- state energy of the particles in the beam. Hint: The average momentum of the particles as they undergo simple harmonic motion is zero, so the value of their momentum is of the order hi ~x. 1.3 Quantum Ideas Incarnate: The Particle in a Box. Consider an ensemble that consists of a huge number of identical systems. Each system is a particle of mass m confined to a one-dimensional square well of width L. The potential energy of such a particle is { 00 x <-t V(x) -- 0 -t ~ x ~ t 00 x> t 16 Chap. 1 Introductory (a) From arguments based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle derive an expression for the minimum kinetic energy Tm in that the particle can have. Provide a clear, complete explanation of your reasoning. (b) Calculate the minimum kinetic energy of an electron that is confined to a nucleus. Take as the diameter of the nucleus the typical value 10 fermi. Express your answer in MeV. Hint: The dimensions of a nucleus correspond to a very small infinite square well. From your answer to part (a) what qualitative conclusion can you draw about the magnitude of the kinetic energy and hence of the velocity of the particle? (c) In early studies of beta decay. nuclei were observed to emit electrons with energies of several hundred keY. Initially, these observations were taken as evidence that electrons are the building blocks of nuclei. Comment briefly on this hypothesis. basing your remarks on your answer to part (b). (d) Suppose the mass of the particle is m = 1 milligram and the width of the box is L = 0.1 mm. Evaluate the minimum energy in eV. Can the fact that Em in # 0 for this system be observed? Why or why not? 1.4 Yet Another Uncertainty Relation. Consider a microscopic particle of mass m that moves in a circle of radius T .

It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. -Sherlock Holmes to Dr. Watson in A Scandal in Bohemia by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Quantum physics is chock full of bizarre, non-classical ideas; weird concepts haunt nearly every section of this book. Three of these ideas--quantization, uncertainty, and duality-<1eserve special treatment, for they are the bedrock of quantum theory. Quantization is probably familiar to you, but you wouldn't have encountered it in a classical physics book. The observables of macroscopic systems are not quantized. The energy of a ball on a string, the linear momentum of a hockey puck, and the angular momentum of an astronaut in a centrifuge-all can take on any of a continuum of values, subject only to whatever constraints are imposed by forces acting on the system. In the macroscopic world nature is continuous. Not so in the microworld, where there is abundant evidence that nature is inherently discrete . Physicists have been aware of this fact since pre-quantum days. By 1900, for example, spectroscopists knew that radiation was emitted by atoms and molecules at discrete frequencies. But the first direct evidence of quantization of energy appeared in collision experiments performed in the early 1900's by James Franck (1882-1964) and Gustav Hertz (1887-1975).1 For several years, Franck and Hertz had been measuring the ionization potentials of atoms, and this experience influenced their interpretation of the results of their col- lision experiments.r In these experiments, they scattered electrons from various atoms; for example, in their most famous experiment, Franck and Hertz accelerated electrons emerging from a heated platinum wire, and sent the resulting beam through a gas of mercury vapor. By measuring the current in the scattered electron beam as a function of the energy of the incident electrons, Franck and Hertz could study the energy loss suffered by the electrons in their collisions with atoms of the gas. They found that the scattered current exhibited a series of sharp drops, each occurring at an incident energy equal to an integral multiple of 4.geV. Franck and Hertz were initially led astray by their prior experience studying ioniza- tion; they concluded that 4.geV is the ionization potential of mercury. But Neils Bohr, on learning of Franck and Hertz's results, realized that the electrons were not ionizing the mercury atoms but rather were exciting them-losing energy to the atoms through inelastic collisions. Drawing on his model of the atom, Bohr further deduced that the energy spacing at which the current drops occur, 4.9 eV, is the separation of two discrete energy levels of the mercury atom,\" In 1914, when Franck and Hertz reported their work, physicists thought that it supported the Bohr theory of the atom-which has since been superseded by quantum lGustav was the nephew of Heinrich Hertz, whom we'll meet in Â§ 2.1. 2For a detailed account of the Franck-Hertz experiment. see Â§ 3.5 of Introduction to Modern Physics, 2nd ed. by J. D. McGervey (New York: Academic Press. 1983). 3Recem precise measurements of the energy separation between the ground state and the first excited state of mercury give the value 4.86eV. The ionization potential of mercury. by the way, is 1O.43eV. 19 theory.\" Nevertheless, the Franck-Hertz experiment stands as one of the first demonstra- tions of energy quantization in atoms, a striking example of non-classical shenanigans in the microworld. Another underlying concept of this world is uncertainty. In Chap. I, I showed you an example of this principle: Nature imposes a peculiar indeterminacy on any attempt to simultaneously measure the position and momentum of a quantum particle. The mathematical manifestation of this indeterminacy is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which we'll return to (and derive) in Chap; 4. Duality, the third great quantum idea, is the focus of this chapter. Wave-particle duality is one of the more confounding ideas of quantum physics, for it most directly challenges our classical intuition about how the world behaves. But we must face the challenge of duality; before we can begin to understand the ways of the microworld, we must disabuse ourselves of the idea that quantum particles can be understood as either classical particles or classical waves. The essence of wave-particle duality is beautifully encapsulated in a single experiment, the famous double-slit experiment. After laying some background in Â§ 2.1-2.3, we'll investigate this provocative experiment in Â§ 2.4. 2.1 WAVES VERSUS PARTICLES The behavior of a microscopic \"particle\" differs in subtle ways from that of a classical particle; in some respects, it resembles the behavior of a classical wave. So before we plunge into the microworld, let's remind ourselves of the classical pictures of particles and waves. . In Chap. I we reviewed the characteristics of a classical particle and the analysis of its motion using Newtonian mechanics. For example, a macroscopic particle has a well-defined position and linear momentum at any time, and from these observables we can calculate its energy. Essential to this description is the notion of spatial localization . The idea that a particle is a localized thing is implicit, for example, in the description of transport of energy through space by a particle in a localized lump. This quality of _the classical description of a particle is, in tum, reflected in the \"state descriptor\" of Newtonian theory: the trajectory. The characteristics of a wave are quite different from those of a particle. A wave is not spatially localized-this quality is reflected in the properties by which we char- acterize a wave, such as the wavelength . Like a particle, a wave carries energy and momentum, but it does so in a non-localized manner, distributed over a wave front. And a wave exhibits distinctive, non-particle-like behavior such as diffraction, interference, and polarization. Not surprisingly, then, the theory classical physicists use to describe the propagation of a wave and its interaction with matter-the electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell (l831-1879)-is quite different from that of Newtonian particle dynamics. So at the macroscopic level, classical physics elegantly and cleanly separates into wave mechanics and particle dynamics. Alas, this division does not apply to microscopic particles, which adamantly refuse to adhere to either the classical wave model or the classical particle model. In some circumstances microscopic particles behave according to the laws of classical mechanics. 4 Although the Bohr model of the atom, the heart of what is called \"the old quantum theory,\" is of enormous historical importance, we shall not study it, because this model is almost 100% wrong. For a good treatment, see Chap. 4 of Quantum Physics of Atoms. Molecules. Solids. Nuclei and Particles. 3rd ed. by R. Eisberg and R. Resnick (New York: Wiley, 1985). 20 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld For example, some collisions of highly energetic atoms with molecules can be explained by using classical collision theory . Yet, in other circumstances quantum particles behave like waves: e.g., electrons that have been scattered by a crystal exhibit a diffraction pattern when they are detected. Analysis of this pattern reveals that in this experiment the electrons propagate precisely as though they had a well-defined wavelength and frequency . .. as though they are waves.! \"This situation,\" you may be thinking, \"is a mess. You tell me that light isn't a wave. And electrons aren't particles. Well, then, what are they? And how can I understand the behavior of electrons if not with Newtonian mechanics, and of waves if not with Maxwell's theory? What is going on here?\" *2.2 ON THE NATURE OF LIGHT Remember, light and shadow never stand still. -John Constable, 19th century landscape artist. To probe deeper into wave-particle duality, we're going to trip lightly through the history of man's evolving ideas about the nature of electromagnetic radiation. This overview need not be comprehensive; you can find several excellent, more complete historical accounts in the Suggested Readings list for this chapter. Corpuscular theories of light, which treated light as though it were composed of particles, have been batting around since the days of Newton and Laplace. But light has an irritating tendency to exhibit distinctively non-particle-like behavior, such as diffraction and interference, which corpuscular theories could not explain. Once Maxwell introduced his wave theory of electromagnetic radiation (in 1870) and it became clear that this theory could beautifully explain such phenomena, most physicists abandoned corpuscular theories of light. According to Maxwell, all electromagnetic radiation-light included-eonsists of real waves propagating through space, waves that carry energy distributed over con- tinuous, non-localized spherical wave fronts. In the late 19th century, it seemed that Maxwell's theory could explain even the most complicated electromagnetic phenomena; so convincing were its successes that in 1886, the distinguished physicist Heinrich Hertz (l857-1894)-uncle of Gustav-wrote: \"the wave theory of light is, from the point of view of human beings, a certainty.\" Hertz, as we shall see, was wrong.\" Walking the Planck It was Albert Einstein (1879-1955) who, in 1905, resurrected the notion that electromag- netic radiation is particle-like rather than wave-like in nature . But where did this idea originate? Einstein has written that the seeds of his 1905 theory were planted by research 5Never let it be said that physics is without irony. The fact that electrons propagate like waves was demonstrated in 1927 by G. P. Thompson (1892-1975). By scattering electrons through a thin gold foil, he conclusively verified the wave nature of the electron, and. in 1937. received the Nobel prize. Several years before. in 1906. G. P.'s father, J. J. Thompson (1856-1940). won the Nobel prize for discovering the electron (1897) and for measuring its charge to mass ratio. J. J.'s experiment was interpreted as conclusive proof of the particle nature of the electron. 6\"When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible. he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible . he is very probably wrong.\"-Arthur C. Clarke. in Profiles of the Future. Sec. 2.2 On the Nature of Light 21 carried out at the tum of the century by the German physicist Max Planck (1858-1947). Although encouraged by his physics teacher to pursue a career as a musician, Planck persevered in physics. His teacher's advice was lousy; Planck's studies of radiation inside a heated cavity led, via a line of reasoning he himself described as an \"act of desperation,\" to the concept of quantization of energy and thence to the birth of quantum physics. Planck did not set out to revolutionize physics. Instead, following in the footsteps of his teacher G. R. Kirchhoff (1824-1887), he sought to understand why hot bodies glow. This phenomenon, which is called black-body radiation, may be familiar to you if you sculpt. Suppose you have crafted a clay pig. To harden the clay, you fire the pig-i.e., put it in a kiln (an oven) and heat to roughly 2000Â° F for about 10 to 12 hours. Suppose there is a tiny hole in the oven, too small to admit light but large enough to see through. At first, of course, you see darkness. But as the pig gets hotter and hotter, it begins to glow. As the temperature of the kiln further increases, this glow becomes orange, then yellow, then white, and fills the oven, obliterating all detail of the pig. Why?Planck formulated this question in slightly more abstract terms, asking: what is the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation inside a heated cavity? More specifically: how does this spectrum depend on the temperature T of the cavity, on its shape, size, and chemical makeup, and on the frequency v of the electromagnetic radiation in it? By the time Planck got into the game, part of the answer was known. Kirchhoff and others had shown that once the radiation in the cavity attains equilibrium with the walls, the energy in the field depends on v and T but, surprisingly, is independent of physical characteristics of the cavity such as its size, shape, or chemical composition. The cavity, of course, encompasses a finite volume. Planck was interested in the radiative energy inside the cavity, not on effects that depend on its volume, so he worked in terms of an energy density. In particular, he sought an expression for the radiative energy density per unit volume p(v , T ). If we multiply this quantity by an infinitesimal element of frequency, we obtain p(v, T )dv, the energy per unit volume in the radiation field with frequencies between v and v + dv at cavity temperature T . Rather than confront the distracting complexities of a real heated cavity, Planck based his work on a model originally introduced by his mentor Kirchhoff. Kirchhoff called his model of a heated cavity in thermal equilibrium a \"black-body radiator.\" A black body is simply anything that absorbs all radiation incident on it. Thus, a black- body radiator neither reflects nor transmits; it just absorbs or emits. From the work of W. Wien (1864-1928), Planck knew that the radiative energy density p(v, T) for a black body is proportional to v 3 and, from the work of J. Stefan (1835-1893), that the integrated energy density 10 00 p(v, T)dv is proportional to T 4 â€¢ But this information did not fully describe the dependence of p(v, T) on v and T; experimental evidence implied a further, unknown dependence on vIT. Wien had actually proposed an equation for the energy density of a black-body radiator, but the theoretical foundation of his theory was shaky. Moreover, his equation worked only in certain circumstances; it correctly explained the u and T dependence of p(v , T) for low temperatures and high frequencies. But it predicted that heated black bodies should emit a blue glow at all temperatures-a prediction confounded by our pig. Planck knew of this defect in Wien's theory, for experiments published in 1901 by H. Rubens and F. Kurlbaum conclusively showed it to fail for high temperatures and low frequencies. 22 Chap . 2 Into the Microworld In his research, Planck focused on the exchange of energy between the radiation field and the walls. He developed a simple model of this process by imagining that the molecules of the cavity walls are \"resonators\"-electrical charges undergoing simple harmonic motion. As a consequence of their oscillations, these charges emit electro- magnetic radiation at their oscillation frequency, which, at thermal equilibrium, equals the frequency v of the radiation field. According to classical electromagnetic theory, energy exchange between the resonators and the walls is a continuous process-i.e., the oscillators can exchange any amount of energy with the field, provided, of course, that energy is conserved in the process. By judiciously applying classical thermodynamics and a healthy dose of physical intuition to his model, Planck deduced an empirical formula for the radiative energy density:\" Av3 p(v,T) = / . eB v T-1 (2.1) In this equation, A and B are constants to be determined by fitting to experimental data; that's why it is called \"empirical.\" Equation (2.1) agreed beautifully with experimental data for a wide range of fre- quencies and temperatures. And, in the limit v ----+ 00 and T ----+ 0, it reduced properly to Wien's law. But Planck was concerned that he could not rigorously justify his for- mula. In a letter dated 1931, he wrote of his dissatisfaction: \"a theoretical interpretation had to be supplied, at all costs, no matter how high . . . I was ready to sacrifice every one of my previous convictions about physical laws.\" Planck had to do just that. For his second assault on the energy density of a black body, Planck adopted a sta- tistical method based on the concept of entropy as interpreted probabilistically by Ludvig Boltzmann (1844-1906). At one point in his derivation, Planck introduced a simplifying assumption (i .e., a trick to facilitate his mathematics). His ploy was conventional in mathematical analysis , and Planck expected to remove his assumption at the end. Planck was in for a rude shock. His assumption is both simple and radical. He knew that a classical black body could exchange any amount of energy with the walls of the cavity; nevertheless, for purposes of his derivation, Planck assumed that only discrete amounts of energy can be absorbed or emitted by the resonators that comprise the walls of the black body. He called these discrete amounts of energy \"quanta.\" To each quantum Planck assigned an energy equal to an integral multiple of hu, where h is the constant h = 6.63 X 10-34 J-sec. Having made this assumption, Planck easily derived the radiation law T 87l\"v2 hv p(v, ) = ~ ehv/kBT _ 1 ' (2.2) where c = 3.0 X 108 m-sec is the speed of light and kt: = 1.38 x 10- 23 J-K- 1 is Boltzmann's constant. Comparing this result with Eq. (2.1), we see that in his new equation Planck derived expressions for the constants A and B that appeared in his empirical form. 7you can find a very nice account of Planck's analysis in Chap. I of The Quantum Physicistsand an Introduction to Their Physics by William H. Cropper (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970). Sec. 2.2 On the Nature of Light 23 This derivation was the theoretical justification Planck sought for the distribution of radiation in a black body. But in laying the foundation for his theory, Planck paid an enormous price, for try as he might, he could not get rid of his artificial constant h. Setting h = 0 inevitably led to a result that disagreed with a huge body of experimental data. Yet, if h is non-zero, then Planck's theory is seriously at odds with physicists' understanding of energy exchange as a continuous process. Planck's rash assumption heralded the strange new physics of the quantum, which dominated the physics community for the next three decades. But physicists, who were then and are today a rather conservative lot, did not take well to being told that their understanding of so basic a process as energy exchange was fundamentally incorrect. Attempts to derive Planck's result without making his drastic assumption failed, and for several years Planck's quanta languished in obscurity, largely ignored. Yet, Planck's assumption was nothing compared to the surprise Einstein had in store. Particles of Light Einstein thought he saw an inconsistency in the way Planck used Maxwell's wave theory of electromagnetic radiation in his derivation. With characteristic intellectual courage, Einstein decided that this inconsistency implied a flaw not in Planck's theory but in Maxwell's. This radical contention shifted the emphasis in research on black bodies from the resonators that comprise the walls to the radiation field itself. Ultimately, it completely altered the way we think about light.8 In 1905 Einstein proposed that the energy in an electromagnetic field is not spread out over a spherical wave front, as Maxwell would have it, but instead is localized in indivisible clumps-in quanta. Each quantum of frequency t/ , Einstein averred, travels through space at the speed of light, C = 3.0 X 10 8 m-sec, carrying a discrete amount of energy hv and momentum lu/]Â«. Thus, in Einstein's model, light transports energy in the same way particles do. G. N. Lewis subsequently dubbed Einstein's quantum of radiation energy a photon, the name we use today. The photon model cast Planck's theory of black-body radiation in, so to speak, a new light. Planck thought that energy exchange between the resonators of the cavity and the field occurs in units of hu because of some strange property of the resonators. To this Einstein said: No; the explanation is that the radiation field itself is quantized. Planck's result is consistent with this extraordinary notion; if the energy in the field is contained in photons-quanta of magnitude hv-then of course only integral multiples of the photon energy can be exchanged with the walls. The photon model explained more than just black-body radiation. One of Einstein's greatest achievements was using it to understand the photoelectric effect-the ejection of electrons from a metal, such as sodium, when light impinges on it. (You see the photoelectric effect in action every time an electric eye opens an elevator door for you or closes one on your foot.) Yet, the photon was too radical for physicists of the early 1900's, and Einstein's model of the electromagnetic field encountered strong opposition. Even as late as 1913-years after the publication of Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect-four distinguished German physicists (including Max Planck) wrote in a petition recommending Einstein's appointment to the Prussian Academy of Science: 8Einstein's radical theory of light grew out of his study of the entropy of high-frequency radiation in a low-temperature cavity. For a readable account of this background research. see The Quantum Physicists and an Introduction to their Physics by William H. Cropper (London: Oxford University Press. 1970). 24 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld Â· .. That he may sometimes have missed the target in his speculations, as, for example, in his hypothesis of light quanta, cannot really be held too much against him, for it is not possible to introduce fundamentally new ideas, even in the most exact sciences, without occasionally taking a risk. One year later the American experimentalist R. A. Millikan (1868-1953) reported a precise verification of Einstein's equation for the energy of a photon, E = hu, and the first measurement of Planck's constant. Yet physicists still resisted abandoning their long-cherished idea that light was a wave. Then, in 1923, Arthur H. Compton (1892-1962) published the results of his x-ray scattering experiments, and drove the last nail into the coffin of the wave theory of light. Compton scattered x-rays-electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength around 10- 10 m and a frequency around 1018sec- l- from a thin layer of a light element such as carbon and measured the shift in the wavelength of the x-rays due to the scattering. His results were seriously at odds with the predictions of Maxwell's beleaguered theory. Compton's data clearly showed that the wavelength of the scattered radiation is larger than that of the incident radiation. After several foredoomed attempts to explain this result with classical theory, Compton tried the photon idea. If x-rays carry en- ergy in localized clumps, he reasoned, then we can apply classical collision theory to their interaction with the electrons of the target. Compton used the classical laws of conservation of energy and linear momentum-as though he were analyzing a game of billiards-and was able to derive the correct expression for the wavelength shift. This analysis vindicated Einstein's idea. It was too much even for diehards: the photon was accepted. What Is Light? Einstein's brilliant notion still does not fully illuminate the nature of light. The photon is a particle-like model, but clearly light does not actually consist of classical particles. Particles do not diffract. They don't interfere. But light does. Yet, this model demolishes the idea that light is a classical wave. Indeed, the nature of electromagnetic radiation after Einstein seemed more ephemeral than ever; depending on the physical conditions, light seemed to behave either like a wave or like a particle. J. J. Thompson wrote that the conflict between these two models was like \"a struggle between a tiger and a shark; each is supreme in his own element, but helpless in that of the other.\" The more you think about wave-particle duality, the more befuddling it seems. If you are new to this idea, you can probably imagine the shock, frustration, and confusion that the interpretive problems of duality induced during the early years of quantum theory. Banesh Hoffmann has written of the impact of this puzzle on physicists of the timet? They could but make the best of it, and went around with woebegone faces sadly complaining that on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays they must look on light as a wave; on Tuesdays, Thursdays , and Saturdays as a particle. On Sundays, they simply prayed. 9See his delightful and often hilarious book The Strange Story of the Quantum, (New York: Dover, 1959). Sec. 2.2 On the Nature of Light 25 *2.3 UNDERSTANDING DIFFRACTION THE CLASSICAL WAY Diffraction, which was first observed by Leonardo da Vinci, is often considered to be the signature of a wave. Diffraction occurs when ripples in a pond encounter a pair of logs that are close together, when light passes through a narrow slit in a window shade, or when x-rays scatter from a crystal. In each case, we can explain the distinctive pattern that forms using classical wave theory. Understand what happens to a wave when it passes through a small aperture-that is, understand diffraction-and you are well on your way to understanding the behavior of waves in more complicated situations. In this section, I'll refresh your memory about this characteristic wave phenomena. 10 A schematic of a single-slit diffraction experiment with light is shown in Fig. 2.1. Monochromatic light of frequency v is incident on a diaphragm in which there is a single slit of width w. We'll assume that the light source is far to the left of the diaphragm, so the incident radiation can be represented by a plane wave. The width of the slit must be small compared to the wavelength A = c]v of the radiation if the slit is to appreciably diffract the light; for example, to diffract visible light enough to observe this phenomenon, we require a slit of width w ~ 10- 4 cm. Light scattered by the diaphragm falls on a detector, such as a photographic plate or a photocell, located at a distance D far to the right of the slit. The detector measures the energy delivered by the scattered wave as a function of the distance x in Fig. 2.1. t~ T -----w- ...i..x=o Lt-D-J Figure 2.1 A highly simplified single-slit diffraction apparatus. At the detector, the distance x is measured from a point on a perpendicular from the midpoint of the slit. The analysis of this experiment 'is performed in terms of the radial distance r from the midpoint of the slit to the point x and the corresponding angle 9. (In this figure, the ratio of the slit width w to the distance D from the diaphragm to the detector has been exaggerated ; in an actual double-slit experiment , D Â» w .) . Light scattered by the single-slit diaphragm forms a beautiful diffraction pattern at the detector. This pattern is characterized by a very bright central band located directly opposite to the slit, surrounded by a series of alternating light and dark regions. The light regions on either side of the central band are called secondary hands, because they are much less intense than the central band. Indeed, the intensity of the secondary bands drops off so dramatically on either side of the central band that only one pair of secondary bands is visible. Additional weak secondary bands exist, though, as you can see in Fig. 2.2, which is a graph of the intensity measured by the detector. If we play around with the frequency control on the light source and study the resulting diffraction IOIf you recently studied classical wave mechanics, you needn't read this review or that in Â§2.4.

A classical physicist would call upon Maxwell's electromagnetic wave theory to explain the pattern in Fig. 2.2. To understand qualitatively what happens when a plane wave passes through a diaphragm we invoke Huygens's Principle, which lets us replace the plane wave and the slit (in our mind's eye) by a large number of closely-spaced , dis- crete radiating charges that fill the region of space where the slit is located.\"! \"Scattered waves\" radiated by different oscillators-i.e., waves that emerge from different locations in the slit region-have different phases, so the superposition of these scattered waves exhibits regions of high and low intensity, as in Fig. 2.2. To put this reasoning on a quantitative footing, we would first use Maxwell's theory to derive ail expression for the electric field at a point (r, (J) on the detector (see Fig. 2.1). But the quantity measured in this experiment is not the electric field; it is the intensity- the rate at which the scattered radiation delivers energy to the detector. This quantity is proportional to the time-averaged energyflux- i.e., to the average over one period of the square of the modulus of the electric field. I'll denote by Isingle((J) the intensity at a fixed value of r due to radiation scattered by a single slit. Omitting the details of the derivation of I singlc((J), I'll just quote the result.P For convenience, I'll write the intensity in terms of its value I o at the principal maxirrium- i,e., at the point r = D , (J = 0, in the central peak in Fig. 2.2-and the handy intermediate quantity wsin (J 0=11\"--- - A ' (2.3) where, of course, A is the wavelength of the incident radiation.

Thus does classical electromagnetic theory rend the veil of mystery from the phenomenon of diffraction. *2.4 UNDERSTANDING INTERFERENCE The theory of diffraction is the foundation for study of the double-slit interference exper- iment. When first performed in 1800 by Thomas Young (1773-1829), this experiment was considered definitive proof of the wave nature of light. We can modify the single-slit apparatus of Fig. 2.1 to suit Young's experiment by simply cutting a second slit in the diaphragm. As shown in Fig. 2.3, the width of the second slit is the same as that of the first, w. We must position the second slit so that the two slits are close together-but not too close: for observable interference to occur, the slit separation s must be greater than w. Again, we shine a beam of monochromatic light of frequency v on the diaphragm and see what happens at the detector, which is far to the right of the diaphragm. Figure 2.3 Schematic of a double-slit apparatus for Young's interference experiment. The distance r to an observation point on the detector is measured from the midpoint of the part of the diaphragm separating the two slits. T x -lx=o 1-+------0------1 WT~ -----s wrh ~. This time, our detector shows an interference pattern like the one in Fig. 2.4. At first glance, this figure may look similar to the diffraction pattern of Fig. 2.2, but on closer examination we see striking differences. For one thing, the interference pattern exhibits more bright bands than the diffraction pattern. This means that the energy of the radiation scattered by the double-slit diaphragm is more evenly distributed than that scattered by a single slit. (In the diffraction pattern about 90% of the energy appears in the central band.) Finally, the individual bands in the interference pattern, which are called interference fringes, are narrower than those of the diffraction pattern. 28 Chap . 2 Into the Microworld (2.6) If we study how the interference pattern changes as we fiddle with the incident wavelength >., the slit separation s, and the slit width w, we discover that the separation between the bright bands increases with increasing >'-just as it did in the diffraction pattern, for which the separation is proportional to >./w. But also we find a difference: the separation in Fig. 2.4 is independent of the slit width w but is inversely proportional to the slit separation s. Figure 2.4 The double-slit interference intensity function Idouble(e) [Eq. (2.6)1 for S Â» A. (This condition produces several maxima in a small region of e.) s sin 0 - The angular interval between successive maxima is AIs . The key to understanding interference is superposition. When the incident plane wave encounters the double-slit diaphragm it \"splits,\" and a diffracted wave emerges from each slit. (In a sense, each slit becomes a source of radiation that travels to the detector.) These waves add in the region between the slit and the detector, and this device measures the intensity of their superposition . Now, at the detector the amplitudes of the electric fields of the diffracted waves are equal, but their phases are not. Consequently, their superposition manifests regions of constructive and destructive interference, as seen in Fig. 2.4. The trick to deriving an equation for the intensity measured in the double-slit experiment-which we'll call Idouble(lJ}-is therefore to add the electric fields of the waves diffracted by each slit. (This step is legitimate because Maxwell's equation for these fields is linear.) Having done so, we could calculate the aforementioned phase difference and would find the field from the lower slit lags the field from the upper slit by an amount (27rs/ >')sin O. The last step is to average the squared modulus of the total electric field at a point (r, 0) on the detector over one period, which yields [ sin (7r w sin0 ) ] 2 (s sin 0 ) Idouble(O) = 410 (7r~) cos2 7r->.- . Now this, I would argue, is a curious result. For one thing, 10 in Eq. (2.6) is the maximum intensity we would obtain in the diffraction pattern of a single slit of width w-i.e. , the very quantity 10 we used in Eq. (2.4). Looking deeper, we find buried in Eq. (2.6) the single-slit intensity Isingle(O). To unearth this function, I'll use the definition (2.4) of a and introduce yet another intermediate quantity s sin 0 ti.cp == 27r->.-. (2.7) With these definitions the double-slit intensity (2.6) stands revealed as Idouble(O) = 4Isingle(O) cos2 (~ti.CP) . (2.8) Sec. 2.4 Understanding Interference 29 This analysis explains the complicated oscillations we see in l <\\oul>l<,(O) as 0 is varied (Fig. 2.4). This structure is compounded of two separate oscillations, one due to the single-slit intensity I single(O)-wh ich depends on the slit width w but not, of course , on the separation-the other due to factor cos2 (11\"f sin 0). The separation s of the two slits is greater than their width w, so the latter oscillation is the more rapid of the two. In fact, the slower oscillation of the single-slit intensity forms the envelope of the double-slit intensity, as you can see in Fig. 2.5.

For this graph . we have cho sen s = 3w / 2. The double-slit pattern is more complicated than the single-slit pattern. And, as you might expect, even more elaborate interference patterns can be generated by using diaphragms with more than two slits. But no matter how baroque the resulting patterns , they can be explained by Maxwell's electromagnetic wave theory. But wait! According to Einstein, a light beam consists of photons and there- fore transports energy in spatially-localized clumps with particle-like properties. But no model based on particle dynamics can explain interference-or, for that matter, diffrac- tionY The implications of our double-slit experiment appear to contradict Einstein 's theory of light. 13We might . for example. argue that a diffraction pattern could result from particle-like scattering of photons from the edges of a single slit. Th is argument sounds good at first. but when translated into a quantitative prediction. it leads to an intensity that does not agree with experiment. For a delightful account of this argument see Chap. 6 of The Character of Physical Law by R. P. Feynman (Cambridge. Mass.: M. I. T. Press. 1965). 30 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld Yet, a model based purely on classical wave theory is also inadequate, for it cannot explain phenomena such as the photoelectric effect and x-ray (Compton) scattering. These experiments support a model in which light interacts with other subatomic particles (e.g., electrons) according to the laws of classical particle dynamics. Maybe we can resolve this conundrum by performing the double-slit experiment using a beam of particles-say, electrons. The behavior of these particles in the experi- ment should differ strikingly from that of light, This is a good idea, but, as we'll see in the next section, the experiment deepens rather than solves the mystery. 2.5 DOUBLE TROUBLE Now is not this ridiculous- and is not this preposterous? A thorough-paced absurdity- explain it if you can. -Chorus of Dragoons, in Patience by Gilbert and Sullivan Our strategy in the double-slit experiment is to send electrons through a double-slit di- aphragm and see how the intensity measured by the detector differs from the interference pattern formed by light. To implement this strategy, we must make a few modifications in the apparatus Young used when he performed this experiment with light. First we replace the light source with an electron gun-a device that produces a (nearly monoenergetic) beam of electrons of energy E. A heated tungsten wire, for example, produces a stream of electrons that we can accelerate to the desired velocity. Second, we replace the photographic plate with an electron detector: a device that counts the number of electrons that arrive in each square meter of unit area per sec. (Like the photographic plate used in Young's experiment, our electron detector measures the rate at which energy arrives at each point on the detector.) A screen covered with phosphor will do; when an electron arrives at the screen, it produces a spot. What would we expect to see at the detector if the electrons were particles, subject to the same physical laws as, say, marbles? Imagine for a moment that we block one slit-say, the lower slit in Fig. 2.3-so that all electrons must come through the other, open slit. Most electrons that make it through the diaphragm will go straight through this slit, \"piling up\" at the detector directly opposite it. We therefore expect to see a maximum in the measured intensity opposite the upper slit. But some particles will scatter from the edges of this slit, so we expect some amount of spread in the pattern. A reasonable guess for the intensity for a beam of particles passing through this apparatus with only the upper slit open is the curve Iu(lJ ) sketched in Fig. 2.6a. The curve 11(0) should be obtained if only the lower slit is open. What should happen when both slits are open? Well, if the electrons are indeed particles, then the measured intensity should be simply III (0)+II (0). This rather feature- less curve is sketched in Fig. 2.6b. (Were you to scale the apparatus to macroscopic size and send through it a uniform beam of marbles-with, of course, a suitable detector- this is what you would see.) But what we actually see when we run the experiment with electrons is altogether different. Sec. 2.5 Double Trouble 31 u (a) u (b) Figure 2.6 (a). Intensity patterns fonned by blocking one of the slits in the diaphragm in Fig. 2.3 and sending particles through the apparatus. (b). What we expect to get when both slits are open. The measured intensities in Fig. 2.7 clearly exhibit bands of alternating high and low intensity: an interference pattern, like the one formed by light (see Fig. 2.4). This observation seems to imply that the electrons are diffracted by the slits at the diaphragm and then interfere in the region between the diaphragm and the detector. We can even fit the measured intensity of the scattered electrons to the double-slit function Idouble(O) of Eq. (2.6) provided we assign to each electron (of mass m and energy E) a wavelength h x = v2mE ' (2.9) But to a classical physicist, steeped in the idea that electrons are particles, Eq. (2.9) is nonsense! Figure 2.7 An electron interference pattern formed in a double-slit experiment. [From P. G. Merli. G. F. Missiroli, and G. Pozzi. Amer . Jour . Phys., 44, 306 (1976). Used with pennission.] Aside: The Real Double-Slit Experiment. The double-slit experiment is no mere thought experiment. For several years double-slit experiments with electrons have been performed in the laboratory. The first such experiment was reported in 1954 by G. Mollenstedt and H. Duker. who observed an electron interference pattern in an apparatus analogous to a Fresnel biprtsm.PNowadays double-slit experiments are usually performed with an electron microscope.Pln a typical experiment of this kind, electrons with energies around 60keV~i.e.â€¢ with a wavelength of roughly ISTheir article appeared in Naturwiss ., 42. 41 (1954).

The distance from the diaphragm to the detector is typically about 106 times the slit separation s. The interference pattern shown in Fig. 2.7 was obtained in such an experiment. Maybe They're Waves? At first, the results of the electron double-slit experiment seem consistent with the (de- viant} notion that electrons are waves, not particles .!\" But as we investigate further, we discover a problem with this hypothesis. Suppose we tum down the intensity of the incident electron beam so that very few electrons per second pass through the diaphragm . Were electrons waves, the interference pattern that forms at the detector after a few seconds would be very weak. As time passes and more and more electrons are scattered by the double-slit diaphragm, this pattern would intensify, ultimately looking like Fig. 2.7. But this isn't what happens. Shortly after we switch on the electron gun, we see at the detector not a diffraction pattern, but spots-just what we'd expect to see were the electrons particles! If you think I'm making this up, look at the actual data in Fig. 2.8a. This result is incompatible with the notion that electrons are waves, since waves transport energy via non localized wave fronts, not concentrated lumps.!? Curiously, the spots in Fig. 2.8a show no particular pattern, neither interference as in Fig. 2.4, nor a double-hump, as in Fig. 2.6. It looks like the electrons are particles that arrive randomly at the diaphragm. But they aren't. With the passage of time, the electrons begin to form the inter- ference pattern of Fig. 2.7. The photographs in Fig. 2.8(b) and (c) show this pattern forming, as if by magic. These pictures are eerie-it's as though each electron knows precisely where it should go to contribute to the interference pattern . This gives rise to the question: If the electrons are particles, what guides them to just the right place on the detector ? We can summarize our observations thusly : when each electron arrives at the detec- tor, its interaction with the material of the detector produces a spot, a spatially-localized point-behavior we associate with a classical particle . Yet, when a number of electrons propagate from the diaphragm to the detector, they somehow form the distinctive pat- tern in Fig. 2.7-behavior we associate with classical waves. Perhaps strangest of all, this pattern appears only after sufficient time has elapsed that a statistically significant number of electrons has arrived at the detector. 'Tis a situation worthy of Gilbert and Sullivan. In the same apparatus we can see electrons behaving like waves or like particles, depending on how long we let the experiment run. The short-term behavior of the electrons is incompatible with the wave model, but their long-term behavior is incompatible with the particle model. So what are they? 16This idea is quite radical-a wealth of experimental evidence to the contrary exists. Early experiments on electrons, such as Thompson 's 1907 measurements of elm, Millikan's 1917 measurements of the electron charge e, and Rutherford's 1911 scattering experiments, strongly support the model of the electron as a discrete, indivisible unit of electric charge-definitely not a wave. 17you can see similar behavior-spots at the detector-if you perform Young's interference experiment (the double-slit experiment with light) at low enough intensity that only a few photons per second arrive at the photographic plate. Sec. 2.5 Double Trouble 33 (a) (e) The Mystery Deepens (b) Figure 2.8 The genesis of an electron interference pattern in the double-slit experiment. Each figure shows the pattern formed at the detector at successive times. Note the seeming randomness of the pattern at short time intervals. [From P. G. Merli, G. F. Missiroli, and G. Pozzi, Amer. Jour. Phys., 44. 306 (1976). Used with pennission.] Whatever theory we dream up to make sense of these observations must preserve the spatially-localized property of electrons and yet explain the pattern formed when many electrons arrive at the detector. Let's try the hypothesis that an electron is a new kind of particle, one that somehow propagates according to wave dynamics. This hypothesis, at least, would let us explain the observed pattern as due to the interference of two electrons, one from the upper slit and one from the lower slit. To test this idea, we devise another variation on the double-slit experiment. If this model of the electron is correct, we should be able to get rid of the inter- ference pattern by turning the incident beam density so low that only one electron goes through the diaphragm at a time. (Such an experiment is technologically feasible using an electron microscope.) A single electron, after all, has nothing to interfere with. But the results of this experiment are not what we expect. Even at the lowest possible inci- dent density, an interference pattern forms. This behavior is totally beyond the power of a particle model to explain. Any such model implicitly assumes that the electron 34 . Chap. 2 Into the Microworld has a trajectory, i.e., that each electron goes through one slit or the other. Yet, in this experiment each electron acts as though it were interfering with itself! 18 Such results force us io accept that in no sense can an electron be thought of as a classical particle or a classical wave. The double-slit experiment beautifully illustrates one of the central mysteries of quantum physics: the dual nature of microscopic entities. I believe that the difficulties many people have understanding the results of this experiment arise because we are hidebound by our classical training and intuition. We persist in trying to force electrons and photons to fit either the classical particle model or the classical wave model. It is perhaps unfortunate that electrons do behave like classical particles in some experiments and like waves in others, for this behavior can seduce us into thinking that there must be some way to retain one of these classical models . But there isn't; neither model by itself is correct, for neither model conforms to the observed behavior of electrons. To explain the double-slit results, we need a wholly new theory : quantum mechanics.l? More Trouble with Trajectories In Chap I, I argued that the very idea of ascribing a trajectory to a microscopic particle is rendered nonsensical by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle-on the grounds that if we can't know precisely a particle's position and momentum at any time , then we cannot even define its trajectory. The implications of this argument are nothing if not far-reaching: it requires us to jettison the entire machinery of Newtonian physics! The double-slit experiment provides further insight into this problem by showing us how misleading is the idea that microscopic particles follow paths in geometrical space. If the incident electrons did follow paths through the diaphragm to the detector, then each would have to pass through either the upper slit or the lower slit. Yet, the results of the double-slit experiment imply that the electrons go through both slits, for an interference pattern forms at the detector even if the incident intensity is so low that electrons traverse the region from source to detector singly . But interference is understood (in classical physics) as arising from the superposition of two (or more) waves, and such an explanation is inconsistent with the notion that the electrons follow classical paths. Aside: Failed Attempts to Trick the Electrons. You may be wondering if the issue of whether trajectories can be ascribed to electrons could be settled by a variation on this experiment-one that would \"trick\" the electrons into revealing which slit they went through. Suppose, for example, that we put an electron detector immediately behind each slit. By seeing which detector registers, we could determine once and for all which slit each electron went through. This gambit works! If we carry out such an experiment, we find that one or the other device (not both) registers for each electron that arrives at the phosphor. But after many electrons have undergone the journey through the diaphragm, if we look for an interference pattern at the phosphor, we find instead that the measured I11There are still more subtleties 10 the double-slit experiment. For a fascinat ing discussion of this experiment , see Volume III of The Feynman Lectures on Physics, by R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton. and M. Sands. (Reading , Mass.: Addison-Wesley , 1965). 19Regrettably, in this book we won 't get quite far enough to work out the quantum mechanics of the double-sl it experiment. It is, however , important to note that theory can fully expla in the results of this experiment. The argument uses a method from the quantum theory of scattering called the eikonal approximation to describe the elastic scattering of electrons by the two slits and the format ion of the observed interference pattern . If you're interested in the details, see G. Anido and D. G. Miller's article in the ArneI'. Jour of Phys., 52, 49 (1984). Sec. 2.5 Double Trouble 35 intensity forms the \"double hump\" pattern characteristic of particles (see Fig. 2.6). So this experiment in no way explains the wave-like behavior of the propagation of electrons in the original apparatus, for in this experiment the behavior of the electrons is consistently particle-like. What went wrong was that we interfered. By measuring position immediately behind the diaphragm, we altered the state of the incident electrons, changing their subsequent behavior and therefore the pattern they formed on the phosphor. In partic- ular, our observation of which slit the electrons went through imparted momentum to them. This transfer of momentum destroyed the interference pattern. This experiment illustrates the interaction between the observer and the observed that we discussed in Chap. 1: a measurement on a microscopic system inevitably alters its state in an uncontrollable way. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle affords some insight into this interaction. To be sure which slit the electrons pass through, we must measure position (just behind the diaphragm) accurately to within an uncertainty ~x that is less than the spacing between the slits. But since the uncertainty product ~x ~Px must be positive, a non-zero position uncertainty implies a non-zero momentum uncertainty. A detailed quantitative analysis along these lines reveals that the resulting ~Px is just large enough to wash out the interference pattern at the detector.P? Duality characterizes all the whole panoply of quantum particles: protons, neutrons, atoms, molecules, etc. Invariable, microscopic entities seem to propagate according to wave dynamics but to interact with each other according to particle dynamics . An explanation of wave-particle duality was not to appear until the advent of the quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Heisenberg, and other physicists that will come forward. But a significant step on the road to this theory was taken in 1923 by Prince Louis Victor Pierre Raymond de Broglie , whom we'll meet in the next section. 2.6 IT ALL STARTED WITH DE BROGLIE The experiments discussed in Â§ 2.3-2.5 raise a host of questions. If electromagnetic radi- ation consists of photons-localized clumps of energy-how can we explain phenomena such as diffraction and interference? If not, then why did Compton have to use classical collision theory to explain the scattering of x rays by metals? On the other hand, if electrons are particles, why do they produce an interference pattern at the detector in the double-slit experiment? The behavior of electrons and photons in these experiments seems provocatively similar---crazy, to be sure, but crazy in the same way. Are electrons and photons in some sense the same? Einstein was deeply puzzled by this question until he noticed a possible answer in the doctoral thesis of a young French physicist. In 1924, Einstein wrote in a letter to his Dutch colleague Hendrik Lorentz (1853-1928) that the research of Prince Louis de Broglie (1892-1975) .....is the first feeble ray of light to illuminate this, the worst of our physical riddles.\" De Broglie's achievement was to synthesize the wave-like and particle-like aspects of microscopic matter. Although de Broglie seems to have only dimly understood the nature of quantum particles, and his rather nebulous physical models of quanta have since been superseded, the importance of his contribution has not diminished. It initiated the development of modem quantum mechanics. 20For details, see J. S. Marsh, Amer. Jour . Phys., 43. 97 (1975). 36 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld Sometimes a Great Notion In 1910 de Broglie began studying history at the University of Paris; soon, however, he switched to physics. His studies were interrupted in 1913 by a six-year stint in the French army, during which he and his brother Maurice worked on wireless telegraphy. Then in 1919 he returned to Paris for his doctoral research. From work on the x-ray spectra of heavy elements, de Broglie knew of photons and the Bohr model of atomic structure. And he was particularly intrigued by \"Planck's mys- terious quanta.\" So he set himself the task of \" [uniting] the corpuscular and undulatory points of view and thus [penetrating] a bit into the real nature of quanta.\" In 1923, lightning struck. As de Broglie tells it: As in my conversations with my brother we always arrived at the conclusion that in the case of x-rays one had [both) waves and corpuscles, thus suddenly-I cannot give the exact date when it happened, but it was certainly in the course of summer 1923-1 got the idea that one had to extend this duality to the material particles, especially to electrons. Thus did de Broglie come up with the idea of matter waves . This idea led him to the important notion that all microscopic material particles are characterized by a wavelength and a frequency, just like photons. Aesthetic considerations seem to have influenced de Broglie's thinking towards the idea of matter waves. He evidently felt that nature should be symmetrical, so if particles of light (photons) were to be associated with electromagnetic radiation, then so should waves of matter be associated with electrons. Simply stated, his hypothesis is this: There is associated with the motion of every material particle a \"fictitious wave\" that somehow guides the motion of its quantum of energy. In spite of its rather vague character, this idea was remarkably successful. For example, using the methods of classical optics (such as Fermat's principle) to describe the propagation of quanta, de Broglie was able to explain how photons (and, for that matter, electrons) diffract and interfere: It is not the particles themselves but rather their \"guide waves\" that diffract and interfere. In de Broglie's words, \"the fundamental bond which unites the two great principles of geometrical optics and of dynamics is thus fully brought to light.\" De Broglie proffered these ideas in his Ph.D. dissertation, which he wrote at age 31. His thesis did not fully convince his examiners, who were impressed but skeptical of the physical reality of de Broglie's matter waves. One examiner later wrote, \"at the time of the defense of the thesis, I did not believe in the physical reality of the waves associated with the particles of matter. Rather, I regarded them as very interesting objects of imagination.f\" Nevertheless, de Broglie passed. Beautiful Equations De Broglie's equations for the wavelength and frequency of his matter waves are elegant and simple. Even their derivations are not complicated.P In his seminal paper of 1923, 21It is not clear that de Broglie himself knew what he meant by a matter wave . In his thes is he notes that \"the definitions of the phase wave and of the periodic phenomenon were purposely left somewhat vague .\" In subsequent papers. de Broglie tried several differen t interpretations of his elusive waves. [For a thorough discus sion of these interpretations. see Chap. V of The Historical Development of Quantum Theory. Volume I, Part 2 by J. Mehra and H. Rechenberg (New York: Springer-Verlag 1982).) 22See Cropper, op. cit., pp. 57-63. Sec. 2.6 It All Started with de Broglie 37 de Broglie began with light quanta-photons-so I'll first recap the derivation of the equation relating the wavelength and momentum of a photon and then press on to material particles . The photon is a relativistic particle of rest mass mo = O. Hence the momentum p of a photon is related to its total energy E through the speed of light e as E p =- . e [for rno = 0] (2.10) To introduce the frequency v of the photon, we use Einstein's equation for the photon energy E = hv to write Eq. (2.10) as hv p= e For a wave in free space, the wavelength is >. = chÂ», so Eq. (2.12) becomes h p = >:. (2.11) (2.12) (2.13) Now, in contrast to a photon, a material particle such as an electron has a non-zero rest mass mo. Therefore the relationship between the energy and momentum of such a particle moving at relativistic velocities (in a region of zero potential energy) is not Eq. (2.10), but rather (2.14) If the velocity of the particle is non-relativistic (v Â« e), then its kinetic energy is simply23 where T is the kinetic energy,24 p2 T= --, 2mo (2.15a) 23The notational conventions of physics dictate a confusing ambiguity between Eqs. (2.14) and (2.15), because the rest mass energy moc2 is included in E in (2.14) but not in (2.15). The relativistic kinetic energy, which is sometimes denoted by the symbol K, is defined as It is this quantity which, in the non-relativistic limit, reduces to Eq. (2.15a). [See Classical Mechanics, 2nd ed. by Herben Goldstein (Reading. Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1983, pp. 307-309).] I'll adhere to standard practice by using E for the energy in the relativistic and non-relativistic cases. 24This equation is usually written with the symbol E standing for the kinetic energy, as p2 E=- 2mo I'll follow this convention in this book whenever dealing with non-relativistic panicles (i.e., most of the time). 38 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld (2.15b) In either case, the derivation of Eq. (2.13) cannot be applied to a material particle. Nonetheless, de Broglie proposed that Eqs. (2.11) and (2.13) be used for material particles as well as photons.P Thus,for electrons, atoms, photons and all other quantum particles. the energy and momentum are related to the frequency and wavelength by I p ~h/~I E = hv de Broglie-Einstein equations (2.16) (2.17)A= Notice that the de Broglie equation A = hlp implies an inverse relationship between the total energy E of a particle and its wavelength, viz., hclE If applied to a photon (by setting the rest mass to zero), this equation reduces to Eq. (2.10). Hence the larger the energy of a particle, the smaller is its wavelength, and vice versa. Question 2-1 Derive a relationship between the wavelength of an electron and its kinetic energy T. Prove that in the non-relativistic limit, your result reduces, as it should, to h hA=-=-. p mov The Unanswered Question De Broglie's notion that some sort of wave guides the motion of every quantum enabled him to explain a variety of hitherto inexplicable phenomena, such as quantization of the orbital angular momentum of an electron in a Bohr orbit of the hydrogen atom. It also led him to suggest that the existence of matter waves could be verified by looking for electron diffraction patterns. Sure enough, in a series of experiments carried out in the years after 1923, such patterns were found. Electrons were diffracting all over the place: at non-relativistic velocities, in the classic experiments of C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer (which were later repeated more accurately by G. P. Thompson/\"), and at relativistic velocities, in experiments by J. V. Hughes and others.P? These successes vindicated de Broglie's ideas. Matter waves were real. But de Broglie's research left unanswered deep and important questions: what is a matter wave? Of what is A the wavelength? How do these mysterious waves control the 25De Broglie based his argument on the special theory of relativity. First, he equated the rest en- ergy moc2 of a material quantum to the energy hvo of its \"periodic internal motion,\" where Vo is the \"intrinsic frequency\" of the particle. Next, he considered a quantum moving at velocity v with momentum p = movlJl - (vlc)2 and used relativistic kinematics to show that the frequency and wavelength of such a particle are given by Eq. (2.16) . 26Amer . Jour . Phys., 29, 821 (1961). 27 A complete Est of references can be found in the article \"De Broglie's Relativistic Phase Waves and Wave Groups\" by H. R. Brown and R. de A. Martins, Amer . Jour . Phys., 52, 1130 (1984) . Sec. 2.6 It All Started with de Broglie 39 propagation of a microscopic particle? The answers are not to be found in de Broglie's writings .F' Nonetheless, by raising such questions and focusing the attention of the physics community on the need to associate some sort of wave with microscopic material parti- cles, de Broglie initiated the quest for a new physical theory. This quest led physicists on a torturous path during the early twenties, which the French physicist Oliver Costa de Beauregard has called the Stone Age of Quantum Mechanics (Era Paleoquantiquei. But rather than follow this path, we shall jump in Part II to the end of the story, the successful theory of Erwin Schrodinger, Werner Heisenberg, and the other fathers of modern quantum mechanics. 2.7 THE CONTROVERSIAL CONCEPTOF COMPLIMENTARITY As for knowledge, it's the scandal of our age that philosophy has been whittled away to a barebones epistomology, and thence to an even barer agnoiology. Have I found a word you don't know, Louis? Agnoiology is the philosophy of ignorance, a philosophy for philosophers. -from Camp Concentration by Thomas M. Disch To explain the behavior of quantum particles, we evidently must use both the classical wave and particle models-in spite of the apparent contradictions between them. To say that this situation poses logical problems is to understate wildly. In the early twenties, this predicament lay heavy on the minds of physicists, until the Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr (1885-1962) proposed a way out. Bohr to the Rescue Bohr was 'one of the intellectual giants of early quantum theory. His ideas and his per- sonality were enormously influential. During the twenties and thirties, the Bohr Institute in Copenhagen (which was financially supported by the Carlsberg Brewery) became a haven for scientists who were developing the new physics. Bohr was not always receptive to quantum ideas; like many of his colleagues, he initially rejected Einstein's photons. But by 1925 the overwhelming experimental evidence that light actually has a dual nature had convinced him. So for the next several years, Bohr concentrated on the logical problem implied by this duality, which he considered the central mystery of the interpretation of quantum theory . Unlike many of his colleagues, Bohr emphasized the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. Like de Broglie, he considered it vital to reconcile the apparently contradictory aspects of quanta. Bohr's uneasy marriage of the wave and particle models was the Principle of Complimentarity. This principle entails two related ideas: 28If you are curious about de Broglie's views, you may want to read excerpts from his thesis. You'll find some selections in the anthology Wave Mechanics, edited by G. Ludwig (New York: Pergamon, 1968). More accessible is his Nobel Prize lecture, which you can find in The World of the Atom, edited by H. A. Boorse and L. MOll (New York: Basic Books, 1963). But beware: de Broglie's works do not make light reading. 40 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld I. A complete description of the observed behavior of microscopic particles requires concepts and properties that are mutually exclusive . 2. The mutually exclusive aspects of quanta do not reveal themselves in the same observations. The second point was Bohr 's answer to the apparent paradox of wave-particle duality: There is no paradox. In a given observation, either quanta behave like waves or like particles. How, you may wonder, could Bohr get away with this-eliminating a paradox by claiming that it does not exist because it cannot be observed? Well, he has slipped through a logical loophole provided by the limitation of quantum physics that we mentioned in Chap. I: quantum mechanics describes only observed phenomena. From this vantage point, the central question of wave-particle duality is not \"can a thing be both a wave and a particle?\" Rather, the question is \"can a thing be observed behaving like a wave and a particle in the same measurement?\" Bohr 's answer is no: in a given observation, quantum particles exhibit either wave-like behavior (if we observe their propagation) or particle-like behavior (if we observe their interaction with matter). And, sure enough , no one has yet found an exception to this principle. Notice that by restricting ourselves to observed phenomena, we are dodging the question, \"what is the nature of the reality behind the phenomena?\" Many quantum physicists answer, \"there is no reality behind phenomena.\" But that is another story.29 Complimentary Observables Before leaving complimentarity, I want to mention another aspect of this topic, one that relates it to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.P\" This principle implies a special relationship between position and momentum . The uncertainties in these observables are related by t:J.x t:J.p ;::: h/2 so if we obtain (via measurement) precise knowledge of either observable, we do so at the expense of any knowledge of the other. Bohr considered this mutual uncertainty as a manifestation of complimentarity in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. The relationship between position and momentum, as expressed in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, differs from the complimentary relationship of the wave and parti- cle nature of quanta: position and momentum are both particle-like attributes of quanta. Rather than describe position and momentum as complimentary, perhaps it would be better to describe them as incompatible. A Philosophical Cop-Out? The Principle of Complimentarity may seem a little vague. Indeed, that is how it struck the audience of distinguished physicists at the international conference in 1927 where Bohr first presented his ideas. These ideas are undeniably subtle, and Bohr did not always express himself clearly. Nevertheless, in spite of some initial confusion , the physicists developing and using quantum theory adopted complimentarity, and today it 29 Anyone even mildly interested in such questions should go out now and buy a copy of Nick Herbert's superb book Quantum Reality: Behind the New Physics (New York: Anchor Press/Doubleday , 1985). 30This dimension of complimentarity was first articulated by Bohr and more fully developed by Wolf- gang Pauli (1900-1958). Pauli, whom we'll meet again, was in a sense the progenitor of this book; he wrote the first quantum mechanics text. Sec. 2.7 The Controversial Concept of Complimentarily 41 is one of the central tenets of the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. (In Part II, we shall discuss this interpretation in detail.) The Copenhagen interpretation has its detractors, but it is a way of making sense (more or less) of the physics of the microworld, and it remains the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics. In spite of the wide adoption of the Principle of Complimentarity, many thinkers have found it philosophically offensive, perhaps because rather than confront the prob- lem of duality head on, Bohr 's principle seems to sneak around it, taking recourse in the limitation of quantum mechanics to observed phenomena. James R. Newman has expressed the uneasiness some feel with complimentarity : In this century the professional philosophers have let the physicists get away with murder. It is a safe bet that no other group of scientists could have passed off and gained acceptance for such an extraordinary principle as complimentarity. 2.8 FINAL THOUGHTS: A FEW WORDS ABOUT WORDS I suspect that some of the difficulties people have with complimentarity stem from clas- sical thinking, from their understandable determination to cling to classical models. But after all, the wave and particle descriptions of nature are merely models. There is no reason to expect them to apply to the whole physical world. The results we have seen in this chapter tell us that in the microworld, each of these models is part of the truth, but each by itself is incomplete. In some cases, the wave model must be invoked to understand observations; in others, the particle model. Electrons aren't particles. They aren't waves, either. They are something else, for which we neither have a name nor a classical model. Properly, we should follow de Broglie's lead and refer to them as \"fragments of energy,\" but that would be awkward. Or we could follow Eddington and call them \"wavicles,\" but that sounds silly. So we stick with \"particles\" (leaving off the quotation marks) and do the best we can. But we mustn't overlook the influence of the language we use on how we think. In the microworld, nature transcends our familiar language and the technical language of the classical physicist. On this point, Werner Heisenberg wrote: The problems of language here are really serious. We wish to speak in some way about the structure of atoms . . . But we cannot speak about atoms in ordinary language. So be careful. Beginning in the next chapter we shall buckle down and take a serious look at the mathematical and physical structure of quantum mechanics, leaving behind for the moment purely qualitative concerns. But tread warily, lest you slip back into the black abyss of classical thinking and consequent confusion. With this caveat out of the way, we can proceed. ANNOTATED SELECTED READINGS The Beginnings The saga of the development of modem physics during the \"Quantum Stone Age\" makes fascinating reading. You can get a glimpse of this history in a modem physics book, such as 42 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld I. Wehr, R., J. A. Richards, Jr., and T. W. Adair III, Physics of the Atom, 3rd ed. (Reading, Mass. : Addison-Wesley, 1978). 2. Tipler, P. A., Modern Physics (New York: Worth, 1978). 3. Eisberg, R., and R. Resnick, Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules , Solids , Nuclei and Particles, 2nd ed. (New York: Wiley, 1974). But there is more to this topic than these introductory surveys let on. You can learn about the key experiments that led the way in this quest in the original papers collected in 4. Boorse, H. A., and L. Motz, eds., The World of the Atom (New York: Basic Books , 1963), or in texts such as 5. Melissinos, A., Experiments in Modern Physics (New York: Academic Press, 1969). Lively accounts of several of these experiments have been published in the five volumes of 6. Maglich, B., ed ., Adventures in Experimental Physics (Princeton, N.J.: World Science Edu- cation, 1972). Of the many delightful popular accounts of the development of modem physics, several of which are mentioned in the Selected Reading list for Chap. I, I particularly like the treatment of history in 7. Gamow, George , Thirty Years that Shook Physics (New York: Dover, 1985). One of the most imaginative treatments of this period is 8. McConnmach, Russell, Night Thoughts ofa Classical Physicist (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press , 1982). This book (which is available in paperback) is a fictional account of the impact on an (imaginary) classical physicist of the coming of modem physics. It is superb. You should certainly read some of the writings of the masters, the men who devel- oped modem physics. A good selection of these can be found in the huge anthology (4). If you only read one author on this history, I would recommend Werner Heisenberg, who was a superb writer as well as a brilliant physicist. Heisenberg's essays are readable, entertaining , and informative. They are available in three (paperback) volumes 9.

Heisenberg, W., Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations (New York: Harper & Row, 1971). 11. Heisenberg, W., Across the Frontiers (New York: Harper & Row, 1974). Want more? There are some excellent single-volume historical treatments available. One that you will find recommended throughout this book (and that is available in paperback) is 12. Cropper, William, H., The Quantum Physicists and an Introduction 10 their Physics (London: Oxford University Press, 1970). Also recommended for its insight and anecdotes is 13. Segre, E., From X-Rays to Quarks : Modern Physicists and Their Discoveries (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman & Co., 1980). For its care and thoroughness, I highly recommend 14.

Rechenberg, The Historical Development of Quantum Theory (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1982). Annotated Selected Readings 43 About Waves Sections 2.3 and 2.4 contain rather cursory reviews of the irreducible minimum you need to know about wave phenomena. Several good texts on waves have been written, and you'll find reference to many of them in later chapters. For reviews of diffraction and interference (beyond those provided here), try 16.

R., The Tiger and the Shark : Empirical Roots a/Wave-Particle Dualism (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1983). This book is especially noteworthy for its treat- ment of the interface between theory and experiment during this period. To find out what is going on today in duality research (yes, there is such research), dig into 20. Diner, S., S. Fargue, G. Lochak, and F. Selleri, eds., The Wave-Particle Dualism : A Tribute to Louis de Broglie on his 90th Birthday (Boston: D. Reidel, 1984). EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand. -Confucius In these exercises and problems we confront the conceptual nature of quantum physics in a variety of situations, ranging from actual experiments to thought experiments to the real world. None of these problems requires much algebra or extensive calculations, but several will demand careful thought. (Some of these problems are review exercises. To solve them you may need to refresh your memory from one of the modern physics texts recommended in this chapter's Selected Readings list.) Exercises 2.1 Wave-Particle Duality in Action. Two kinds of microscopes are currently used in research: electron microscopes and light microscopes. Both exploit the wave nature of microscopic particles-electrons in the former apparatus, photons in the latter. The limit of the resolving power of a microscope is the smallest distance separating two points in space that can be distinguished under ideal conditions. This quantity is roughly equal to the wavelength of the particles used in the microscope. Hence the resolving power is a measure of the uncertainty in the position of an observed object. (a) Consider a light microscope in which 4 eV photons illuminate an object. Calculate the momentum of such a photon (in MKS units). 44 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld (b) Evaluate the minimum uncertainty in the position of a subatomic particle being observed with 4 eV photons. (c) Repeat parts (a) and (b) for an electron microscope that uses 4eV electrons. (d) Suppose the position of a particle is determined with the light microscope of parts (a) and (b). What is the corresponding uncertainty in the momentum of the observed particle after the position measurement? (e) Suppose the position of a particle is measured with the electron microscope of part (c). What is the uncertainty in the momentum of the observed particle after the measurement? (f) What advantages do electron microscopes have over light microscopes? 2.2 Macroscopic Physics or Microscopic Physics? (a) Consider a particle of mass 1 g that is moving at a speed v = 10 m sec-t o To study the physics of this particle, do we need to consider its wave nature? Justify your answer with a simple calculation and a brief explanation of the significance of the result. (b) Here is a table of the diameters and ionization potentials of several atoms: Atom Diameter (A) Ionization Potential (eV) He 1.16 24.6 Ne 1.36 21.6 Ar 2.64 15.7 An important experimental technique for studying some of the properties of an atom is to ionize the valence electron, causing it to be ejected from the atom so that its properties can be studied.\" In such an experiment do we need to consider the wave nature of the electron? As in part (a), be sure to justify your answer. Problems 2.1 Black-Body Radiation. One of the early advances in the study of black-body radiation was the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This law is a simple formula for the power radiated from the surface of a black body. It expresses the radiated power P per unit surface area in terms of the temperature as where T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin of the black-body radiator and a is the Stefan- Boltzmann constant, In astrophysics, the upper atmospheres of stars are sometimes considered to be black-body radiators. Using such a model and the Stefan-Boltzmann law, estimate the atmospheric temperature of the sun. Hint: For the incident radiant solar flux arriving at the earth's outer atmosphere use the value 1.4 x 103 J-m- 2 -sec-to The diameter of the sun is about 1.4 x 10 9 rn, and the average radius of the earth's orbit is I astronomical unit-about 1.5 x 1011 m. 2.2 The Ultraviolet Catastrophe. Another early advance in understanding the physics of black-body radiation was the derivation by Rayleigh and Jeans of a formula for the radiation density function p. These physicists used 3tThe valence electron is the least tightly bound electron in the atom. It is bound by an amount equal to the ionization potential of the atom. For example, it takes 24.6 eV to ionize a He atom. Exercises and Problems 45 classical arguments to obtain this quantity as a function of the wavelength A of the radiation and the temperature T of the cav ity.32 They obtained p(A, T) where kB is the Boltzmann constant. (a) From Planck's radiation formula (2.2) derive an expression for p(A, T) . Hint : Remember that the total energy density-i.e., including all frequencies-must be the same whether v or A is used as the independent variable. (b) Compare the Rayleigh-Jeans radiation formula given above with Planck's result as ex- pressed in (a). Are the two in agreement for any ranges of A and T? If so, determine quantitatively where the two expressions agree . (c) Using Planck's result for p(A, T ) show that the total energy density is proportional to T4. (d) Derive the total energy density from the Rayleigh-Jeans formula. Why was this result called the ultraviolet catastrophe? 2.3 An Actual Case of Electron Interference. A double-slit experiment with electrons like the one discussed in Â§ 2.5 was reported in 1961 by Claus Jonsson.P\" The apparatus he used is quite similar to that shown in Fig. 2.3. In this apparatus, two slits of width w = 0.5 It (where 1 It = 10-6 m) are cut in a diaphragm made of copper foil. These slits were separated by s = 2 It. Jonsson accelerated electrons toward this diaphragm through a potential difference of 50kV. The distance from the diaphragm to the detector was D = 35 em, (a) Let p denote the momentum of the electrons. Derive an expression for the fringe spacing, i.e., the separation between adjacent maxima in the pattern of interference fringes that forms at the detector. (Express your answer in terms of p, D, s, and fundamental constants. Depending on how you approach this problem, you may need to read Â§ 2.4) . (b) From the wavelength of the electrons in this experiment evaluate the fringe spacing. (c) In the design of Jonsson's experiment, it was necessary to include some electrostatic lenses between the double-slit diaphragm and the detector. These lenses are shown schematically in Fig. 2.3 . I. From your answer to part (b), explain why these lenses are necessary. (d) Suppose we want to perform this experiment with visible light rather than with electrons. To obtain interference with photons in JOnsson's apparatus, we must scale its dimensions accordingly-i.e., we must multiply each of the dimensions given above by the ratio of the wavelength of a visible photon to that of an electron. Calculate values of s, w, D, and the fringe spacing for such an experiment. Would it be practical to perform this experiment with photons? Why or why not? 2.4 Evaluating de Broglie Wavelengths. (a) The de Broglie wavelength of a particle is an important parameter in the design of experiments based on phenomena such as particle diffraction. To see why, first evaluate the de Broglie wavelengths of (I) a 144 eV electron; (2) a 1 eV electron; (3) a 1 eV proton; (4) a 1 eV alpha particle. 32A recap of their derivation can be found in Fundamentals of Modern Physics by R. M. Eisberg (New York: Wiley, 1967), pp. 51-57. 33Zeitschriftfiir Physik . 161,454 (1961). 46 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld Figure 2.3.1 Arrangement of lenses used in the double-slit experiment with electrons.

Explain your answer. (b) Neutron-crystal diffraction experiments are typically carried out using neutrons of energy ::::: 50meV. Why? (c) An important class of high-energy physics experiments entails accelerating protons to an energy large enough that their wavelength is 0.5 fermi. What is the energy of such a proton? Hint: You cannot use the same equations to do parts (b) and (c) of this problem. (d) In this problem, we have considered situations in which we could base our calculation of the de Broglie wavelength on the non-relativistic energy-momentum relation E = :t... 2m and situations in which we had to use the relativistic relation (2.4.2) where mo is the rest mass of the particle in question . The justification for using (2.4.1) when appropriate is that this equation is the non-relativistic limit of (2.4.2). Of course, using (2.4.1) introduces some error into the resulting wavelength, but for non-relativistic velocities this error is negligible. Suppose, for example, we are willing to accept a 5% error in the de Broglie wavelength of a particle . Determine the minimum energy for which Eq. (2.4.1) will lead to a wavelength of this accuracy for (I) an electron; (2) a proton. 2.5 Diffraction in Everyday Life. In each of the following tragic circumstances, determine whether or not particle diffraction will occur. Justify your answer in each case with a quantitative result and a qualitative argument. (a) A 1986 Mercedez-Benz, of mass 4000 kg travelling at 200 mph, slams into a garage; (b) A stone of mass 10 g hurtles at 10m/sec into a 0.3 m window; (c) A grain of pollen of diameter 10- 5 cm enters a 1.0 em nostril. Exercises and Problems 47 Hint: A reasonable density for a pollen grain is 2 gm/cm'' . Assume that the pollen is at room temperature (270 C) and that its translational energy is equal to the thermal energy of the air molecules in the room. 2.6 Quantization and the Correspondence Principle. In Â§ 2.2 we saw Max Planck astound the world of physics by proclaiming that microscopic oscillators in a black body can have only discrete energies En = nhv, (2.6.1) where v is the frequency of the oscillator and h = 6.626 X 10-34 J-sec. Yet we know that macroscopic oscillators have continuous energies. In this problem we shall explore this apparent contradiction and show that it isn't a contradiction at all. (a) Consider the following macroscopic oscillator: two masses m = 1 g are attached to a spring and oscillate with amplitude A = 1.0cm at frequency v = 100Hz. Use classical physics to calculate the energy of the oscillator, expressing your result in joules, ergs, and in electron volts (eV). Now, using Planck's relation (2.6.1), calculate the corresponding value of n. (b) From your answer to (a), calculate the percentage change in energy that results from unit change in n. Could you measure such a change? (c) The H2 molecule is a microscopic oscillator. The mass of each hydrogen atom is roughly 1.7 x 10- 24 g. The frequency of oscillation of the two atoms in H2 is v ::::: 1.0 x 10 14 sec-I. From this data, calculate the energy of this oscillator (in electron volts) for n = 1, 2, and 3. (d) Using classical physics, calculate numerical values (in A) for the amplitude of the three states considered in (c). We see that the amplitude ofa microscopic oscillator is quantiz ed. 2.7 An Equation for de Broglie's Matter Waves. In Â§ 2.6, we discussed the hypothesis of the irrepressible Prince Louis de Broglie, who in his Ph. D. thesis maintained that all matter has wave-like propenies-so that, for example, material panicles should display diffraction phenomena when they interact with objects whose size is of the order of the panicle's wavelength. In this problem, we use the de Broglie and Einstein relations (2.16) to derive a \"wave equation\" for a panicle moving through space in the absence of any forces-i.e., a free panicle. NOTE: It is convenient in this problem to write these relations in terms of the angular frequency w = 271\"v and the wave vector k 271\"/>', to wit: E = hv = hw p = hi>' = hk, where h = hl(271\"). (a) Write down an expression in exponential form for a traveling wave lIt(x, t ) propagating in the +x direction. Use A for the amplitude of the wave, >. for its wavelength, and v for its frequency. We shall suppose that this wave \"represents\" (in some sense) a free panicle of mass m . (b) Rewrite your wave function lIt(x , t ) in terms of the pan icle's momentum p and its energy E. At this point we ask the obvious question: what son of equation does lIt(x, t) satisfy-i.e., what is the \"wave equation\" for a free panicle? From our experience with waves in classical physics, we expect this to be a differential equation in x and t. The general form of such an equation is 48 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld We want to derive a general equation for the de Broglie wave, so we must impose a restriction on the coefficients ao, aI , ... , blo b2, . . , . These quantities can involve fundamental constants (such as m, e, and h) but not quantities that depend on the wave (such as A and E). (c) Figure out the simplest such differential equation by imposing the requirement that your equation be consistent with the classical relationship between energy E and momentum p of a free particle , E = p2/(2m). You have just derived the Schrodinger equation for a free particle! (d) Argue from your answer to (c) that the wave function for a free particle must be a complex function of x and t. 2.8 An Equation for de Broglie's Matter Waves. In Â§ 2.1 we briefly discussed quantization of energy. But energy is not the only observable of microscopic systems that is quantized. To the contrary: most observables of quantum systems exhibit quantization. In this problem we shall illustrate quantization of angular momentum in a thought experiment (Gedanken-experiment). This experiment also illustrates the subtle , beautiful interplay of the fundamental ideas of quantum physics : in this case , of duality and quantization. In Fig. 2.8.1 is shown a \"quantum hamster cage.\" (Assume that the \"quantum hamster\" is out frolicking, so that the cage is empty.) This miracle of rare device consists of two end discs connected by N equally-spaced pins, where N is very large. The cage is mounted on frictionless bearings about the indicated rotation axis so that it can tum freely . (The rotation axis is perpendicular to the paper in this figure.) Let a denote the radius of the cage, as shown in the side view in this figure. a Source Rotat ion axis Side view Figure 2.8.1 The quantum hamster cage. [Adapted from Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by R. H. Dicke and J. P. Winke (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1960).] Suppose a monochromatic light source projects a beam of photons radially outward from the rotation axis. The beam falls on a small portion of the circumference that, since N is large, includes many pins. (a) To a good approximation, the pins in this set-up constitute a plane-wave diffraction grating, so light from the source will be diffracted through various discrete angles. Let () denote one of the angles of diffraction . Derive an expression for sin () in terms of the photon wavelength A, N , a, and an integer n. Your answer is an expression, in the language of mathematics, of the wave-like characteristics of the photons in the beam. (b) Now let's explore the particle-like characteristics of the photons . After a photon leaves the source , it moves radially outward . Consider such a photon with linear momentum p before it encounters the pins. Determine the angular momentum about the drum axis of the moving photon. Justify your answer . (c) Suppose the photon of part (b) is scattered by the pins through an angle (). Determine the magnitude of the angular momentum of the photon after it is scattered. Exercises and Problems 49 (d) Using conservation of angular momentum, the de Broglie relations (2.16) and your results from parts (aHc), show that the angular momentum of the drum is an integral multiple of Nh, where n == h/2rr. (Assume that the drum is initially at rest.) 2.9 Pair Annihilation. Among Einstein's epochal contributions to physics are the ideas of (I) the quantization of energy associated with electromagnetic radiation, as expressed by E =hu, and (2) the mass- energy equivalence expressed by E = mc 2 â€¢ In this problem, we shall explore the connection between these ideas in a particularly interesting physical situation. The process of pair annihilation involves an electron and a positron. A positron is a particle with the same mass and magnitude of charge as the electron, but with the opposite sign ofthe charge-i.e., a positron is a positively-chargedvanti-electron't.P' In the annihilation process, an electron and a positron that are (essentially) at rest next to one another unite and are annihilated . The process entails complete conversion of mass energy to radiation energy. (a) Calculate the amount of energy that results from such a pair annihilation, expressing your result in joules, ergs, and eV. (b) In the most commonly observed annihilation event, two photons of equal energy are emitted . Explain physically why this result is expected . (c) Photons, as you know, have zero rest mass. We can, however , assign a \"pseudomass'vn to the photon provided we agree to use it only in equations for the momentum and relativistic self-energy. Consider a photon of energy hu, Derive an expression for m and for the momentum p in terms of the photon wavelength Aand fundamental constants. Calculate values for m and p for the photons in part (b). 34The positron was the first anti-particle discovered. II was discovered by C. D. Anderson in 1932; four years later, Anderson received half a Nobel Prize for his efforts. 50 Chap. 2 Into the Microworld CHAPTER 3 First Postulates The State Function and Its Interpretation 3.1 Patterns of Propagating Possibility: Probability Waves 3.2 Systems and States Thereof * 3.3 Probabilities: A Review 3.4 The Gospel According to Born 3.5 How to Normalize a State Function 3.6 Great Expectations (and Uncertainties) 3.7 Final Thoughts: What the State Function Isn't There was a moment's silence while everybody thought. \"I've got a sort of idea,\" said Pooh at last, \"but I don't suppose it's a very good one.\" \"I don't suppose it is either,\" said Eeyore. -The House at Pooh Corner by A. A. Milne Like classical physics, quantum physics need not be able to explain everything. But it should enable us to qualitatively and quantitatively explain and predict the properties and behavior of a reasonable variety of systems. In the microscopic realm, the systems we are interested in range in complexity from a particle moving through space in the absence of external forces to complex bound aggregates of particles, such as nuclei, atoms, molecules , and solids. And like macroscopic (classical) systems, microscopic (quantum) systems can exist in a variety of states; each state is characterized by unique values for the physical properties of the system: energy, momentum, etc. In Part I we reviewed the way in which a classical state of a single macroscopic particle is defined by the particle's trajectory {r(t), p( t) }.1 We also argued that a state of a microscopic particle, such as an electron, cannot be represented by a trajectory, because according to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle we cannot specify simultaneous precise values of r(t) and p(t). Indeed, trajectories must not appear in a physical theory for the microscopic universe. In this chapter we'll discover and explore the way in which we do represent a state in this universe. We're going to meet the wave function . Our guide in this quest for a \"state-descriptor\" for the microverse is the wave- particle duality that characterizes the behavior of microscopic particles. In particular, in Â§ 3.1 we'll search for clues in the results of the double -slit experiment of Chap. 2. Doing so will lead us to the wave function and to the first postulate of quantum mechanics, the topic of Â§ 3.2. In reexamining data from the double-slit experiment we'll also find a clue to the physical interpretation of the wave function . This interpretation is the essence of the second postulate of quantum mechanics, which we'll formulate in Â§ 3.4. Finally, in Â§ 3.6 we'll extend the probabilistic approach to two vital statistical quantities: the expectation value and the uncertainty . Discussing the uncertainty will bring us full circle to one of the key ideas we discussed in Chap. 2. I want to keep our discussion of these new ideas simple at first, so in this chapter we'll consider states of a single particle at a fixed time. The time development of these states-according to the Schrodinger Equation-is the topic of Chap. 6. I also want to focus on a single physical property : position, because it's comparatively easy to extract information about this property from a wave function . We'll develop machinery for studying other physical properties in Chap. 5. 3.1 PATTERNS OF PROPAGATING POSSIBILITY: PROBABILITY WAVES Any theory of the physics of microscopic particles must be able to explain the weird behavior of electrons in the double-slit experiment. In Â§ 2.5 we saw that en masse 1 More precisely, the state of a system in classical mechanics is defined by a set of generalized coor- dinates and their canonical momenta. See Jerry B. Marion, Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems , 2nd ed. (New York: Academic Press, 1970). 52 Chap. 3 First Postulates electrons in this experiment create an interference pattern at the detector. Yet individual electrons arrive as localized \"clumps\" of energy. This dual nature must be built into any theory that purports to describe the microworld. But such a theory must also incorporate the limitation we discovered in Chap. 2: we cannot know which slit a particular electron passes through. In this section, we'll reconsider the double-slit experiment and formulate a couple of hypotheses to explain its results. This voyage of discovery will lead us to a fundamental element of quantum physics: the wave function. Another Look at the Double-Silt Experiment with Light Let's see if the Young interference experiment-the double-slit experiment with light (Â§ 2.4)-<:an give us a clue to the mystery of electron interference. According to the classical theory of electricity and magnetism, the interference pattern that forms when a (coherent) beam of light passes through the double-slit apparatus arises from the super- position of two electromagnetic waves, one diffracted from each slit. Let's look a bit more closely at this explanation. The detector in the Young experiment measures light intensity. This quantity is proportional to the squared magnitude of the electromagnetic field at the detector.? Let's label the electric field vectors for each diffracted wave by a subscript that indicates which slit the wave passed through: E1(x) and E2(x) .3 In terms of these fields, the intensity It 2 ( x) for the case of both slits open is (3.1a) Now, when we expand the right hand side of (3.1a), we find terms that involve products of the two electric fields: (3.1b) The two terms in square brackets in Eq. (3.1bHhe \"cross terms\"-are the mathemat- ical manifestations of the physical superposition of diffracted waves that produces the interference pattern. Of course, this explanation rests on the fact that Maxwell's theory thoughtfully provides things to superpose, namely electromagnetic waves.\" 2In fact, the intensity at a point x on the detector is where eo is the permittivity of free space and c is the speed of light. 3For convenience , I will implement a very slight change of notation in this chapter from that in Chap. 2: to denote the slits I'll use numbers rather than the more primitive \" upper\" and \"lower\" labels of Â§ 2.5. Of course, you can number the slits any way you like; just be consistent. Similarly, we use 112 rather than [double for the double-slit intensity. Finally, we use z , the distance along the detector in Fig. 2.3, rather than e as the independent variable. 4What allows us to add electromagnetic waves in this fashion and thereby obtain an intensity that explains the observed interference pattern in Young's experiment is the linearity of the fundamental equations for electromagnetic fields, Maxwell's equations. Similarly, the fundamental equation of quantum physics, the Schrodinger equation, turns out to be linear, and, as we'll soon see, quantum waves must obey superposition . The connection between superposition of quantum waves and the linearity of the equation that we solve to determine these waves will be an important topic in Chap. 6. Sec. 3.1 Probability Waves 53 Back to Electrons Now let's return to the double-slit experiment with electrons and try to apply the principle we used to explain the results of Young's experiment: superposition. Immediately, we run into a road-block. In classical mechanics we do not use waves to describe the states of particles. We use trajectories, and trajectories can't be superposed and don't interfere. Aside: Superposition According to de Broglie. As we saw in Â§ 2.6, de Broglie dealt with this difficulty by introducing a concept not included in conventional clas- sical mechanics: the matter wave. His idea sounds good: we need something to superpose, and a matter wave is as good as any other. But it's hard to see how to make de Broglie's nebulous notion the basis of a workable physical theory. In fact, all straightforward efforts to associate a wave with an electron fail. For example, we might try to explain the behavior of the electrons by conjecturing that they actu- ally are classical waves. But the results of the double-slit experiment rule out this hypothesis: the pattern of dots seen at the detector after a short time clearly shows the particle-like qualities of electrons. More subtly, these results also preclude the hypothesis that electrons are classical particles somehow guided through space by a wave. Such an explanation assumes that electrons follow trajectories, and we know from Chap. 2 that trajectories are forbidden. Evidently, a more subtle idea is needed. Let's return to the results of the double-slit experiment and see if they suggest an approach. It is useful to think about this experiment in terms of events. We can define an event in this experiment to be the arrival of an electron at the detector. If you'll glance back at Fig. 2.8, you'll see that the first several events in the double-slit experiment seem to be random-i.e., the locations of the spots formed by these arrivals appear to be random. Significantly, it is only after a large number of events that we see a well-defined pattern. Let's see if we can incorporate this feature of the results into a hypothesis. One way to describe mathematically phenomena that are evident only after a large number of events have occurred is with probability theory. The results of the double-slit experiment suggest that we try thinking about the propagation of electrons using this approach. For example, we could ascribe to the electrons a probability of arriving at each location x on the detector. This conjecture, in tum, suggests that we associate with the electrons in the incident beam a \"probability function.\" The idea is that this function somehow contains information about the probability that an electron in the beam will wind up at each x after it passes through the diaphragm. According to this interpretation, the detector implicitly measures this probability function, for the information carried by this function is manifested in the measurement by the number of electrons that arrive at each x. The trick is to tum this vague idea into a hypothesis that is consistent with the experimental results. Here's our first attempt at formulating such a hypothesis: interpret the electron intensity measured by the detector as a probability distribution; i.e., Trial Hypothesis 1 The motion of the electrons in the incident beam is governed by a probability distribution function that we'll denote by P12(X, t) . That is, at each time t this function is large at values of x where an electron is likely to be found and small at values of x where it is unlikely to be found. 54 Chap. 3 First Postulates This formulation seems a step in the right direction; but does it work? Let's put it to the test of experimental verification by devising a variation on the double-slit apparatus of Â§ 2.8. Suppose we close a shutter on slit 2, thereby forcing all incident electrons to pass through slit I. We observe that at the detector these electrons form a diffraction pattern like the one in Fig. 2.2a; the corresponding intensity is shown in Fig. 2.6a. Let's denote the probability distribution function for detecting an electron at position x for this apparatus-with only slit I open-by PI (x, t). Similarly, we'll denote by P2 (x, t) the probability function for electrons in an apparatus where slit I is closed and slit 2 is open. The intensity function for this case is also that of Fig. 2.6a. Now, if our trial hypothesis is correct, we should be able to relate the probability function for the apparatus in which both slits are open, P12 ( X , t) , to the single-slit functions PI (x, t) and P2 (x , t). So let's return to the two-slit case. If we conjecture that in this case each electron that reaches the detector went through either slit I or slit 2, then these probability distribution functions should be related by5 (An Incorrect Equation) But the experimental data we studied in Chap. 2 tells us that this equation is wrong. To convince yourself, go back to Fig. 2.6. Compare the sum of the intensities shown there to the intensity for the interference pattern. Evidently, trial hypothesis # I won't do the job. Can you figure out what's wrong with it? Birth of a Not/on The trouble with our first hypothesis is that it ignores the lesson of the Young interference experiment: to explain an interference pattern we need something to superpose. But we can't superpose probability distributions; they don't interfere with one another. But waves do. This suggests that at its most basic level. our theory must be formulated in terms of some sort of wave. So let's devise an alternative trial hypothesis, one that makes the fundamental element of the theory a \"probability wave.\" This new wave will have all the attributes of a classical wave: a wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and so forth. I'll denote it by the Greek symbol lit(x, t) . We know little about this function at present (!), so we'll consider the most general case, and suppose that lit is complex': In our new hypothesis, it is the probability wave lit(x,t) that contains information about the likelihood of an electron being detected at position x at time t. In this new approach, the detector measures the \"intensity\" of our probability wave, i.e., the square of its magnitude. So the relationship between the wave and the probability distribution it describes is7 I probability ex: I wave 1 2 I (3.2) 51 have here used a result from probability theory: Since probabilities of mutually exclusive events add, the probability function for the two-slit experiment must be the sum of those for each single-slit experiment. If this result isn't familiar, see the review of probability theory in Â§ 3.3. 6For a review of complex numbers and functions, see Appendix K. 7Equation (3.2) and its successors in this section are written as proportionality relations rather than equalities because we are here discussing relative rather than absolute probabilities. This distinction will be explained in Â§ 3.3-3.5 when we investigate normalization. Sec. 3.1 Probability Waves 55 So the idea is that the function w(x, t) is to be interpreted as a position probability amplitude. Here's the new hypothesis : Trial Hypothesis 2 The propagation of the electrons is governed by a probability wave w(x, t). At any time t, this function is the position probability amplitude for detection of the electron at position x. Does this hypothesis conform to observations? Let's see. Consider first the appa- ratus with slit 2 closed and slit 1 open, and let WI (x , t) denote the probability wave for electrons that reach the detector in this case. According to Eq. (3.2), the probability of an electron in such a state showing up at location x on the detector at time t is determined from the squared modulus of this function, viz.s (3.3) In an apparatus with slit 1 closed and slit 2 open, the probability amplitude for electrons that reach the detector is W2(X, t) , and the corresponding intensity is P2(X, t) ex: IW2(X, tW o (3.4) In the double-slit experiment, the functions WI (x, t) and W2(X, t) define two possi- ble states of the electron , one corresponding to passage through slit 1, the other to slit 2. In this case, the appropriate probability wave is the superposition (aha!) of WI and W2, . 9t.e., WI2(X ,t) = Wl(X,t) + W2(X,t) . (3.5) Now this is important: the probability amplitude W12 (x, t) represents a superposition state that includes the two possibilities represented by Wl(X,t) and W2(X,t). The measured intensity corresponds to the probability distribution, which according to (3.2) is the squared modulus of the intensity : PI2(X, t) ex: IWI2(X, tW (3.6) = IWl(X,t) + W2(X,tW. (3.7) The last step in verification of trial hypothesis # 2 is demonstrating that Eq. (3.7) predicts the observed interference pattern . To simplify the algebra involved in this demonstration, I want to write the functions WI (x, t) and W2(x, t) in terms of their magnitudes and phases.!\" If 01 (x , t) and 02(X, t) denote the phases, we can write the probability amplitudes as (3.8a) 8Strictly speaking, IWI (x, tW is a probability density function and must be multiplied by an infinites- imal volume element dx in one dimension to determine a probability. We'll get to this subtle but important complication in due course (Â§ 3.4). 9Nothing in the apparatus singles out one slit over the other. That is, it' s equally likely that an incident electron will go through slit I as through slit 2. That 's why I assigned equal weights to each single-slit amplitude in this equation. 10 Any complex number z can be written as the product of a magnitude Izi times a phase factor ei o (see Appendix K). Note carefully that in Eqs. (3.8) both magnitude and phase depend on x and t. 56 Chap. 3 First Postulates and When we substitute (3.8) into (3.7), we obtain the probability function PIZ(X, t) ex: IWIIZ + IWzlZ+ IWd IWzl [ei (Ck l - Ck 2 ) + e-i (Ck l - Ck 2 ) ] = IWIIZ+ IWzlZ+ 21wd IWzl COS(OI - OZ). (3.8b) (3.9a) (3.9b) Look at the third term on the right-hand side of (3.9b) : it's an interference term! [Recall the crucial role played by the interference term in Eq. (3.1b) in our explanation of the results of Young's experiment.] Depending on the phase difference 01 - Oz of the probability waves, this term produces constructive or destructive interference in the quantity measured at the detector. To read the physical significance of this mathematical result, we tum to our pro- posed interpretation of the probability function P1Z(x, t). According to this interpre- tation, electrons congregate at values of x where constructive interference occurs (the high-intensity regions of the detector) and avoid places where destructive interference occurs (the low-intensity regions) . These extremes (and the values inbetween) explain the observed interference patterns of the double-slit experiment. Evidently, trial hypothesis # 2 works! Look at what we've accomplished. Reasoning by analogy with the theory underly- ing the Young interference experiment and clinging tenaciously to the idea of affiliating some sort of \"detection probability\" with quantum particles, we have discovered the fundamental element of quantum theory: the wave function. That the predictions of our new theory agree with the results of the double-slit experiment is reason to tum this hypothesis into a formal postulate, which we'll do in the next section . 3.2 SYSTEMS AND STATES THEREOF Quantum physicists are interested in all sorts of physical systems-free protons, con- duction electrons in metals, atoms ranging from the simple (hydrogen) to the dauntingly complicated (uranium), molecules from Hz to DNA. Each of these systems consists of one or more microscopic particles that may be interacting among themselves via inter- nal forces and may be exposed to external fields (e.g., electromagnetic or gravitational fields). Remarkably, states of these diverse systems are represented by the same type of varmints: state functions . Introducing the State Function Position probability amplitudes like the waves we used in Â§ 3.1 to explain electron interference are the basic elements of quantum theory. In this theory each state of a system is represented by a different wave function. Actually, most quantum physicists are interested only in states that can be studied in a laboratory-such states are said to be physically realizable. The wave function also goes by the aliases state function and Sec. 3.2 Systems and States Thereof 57 state vector. I'll use capital Greek letters (see Appendix G) to symbolize wave functions and, in particular, will use Wfor a \"generic wave function.t\"\" The stratagem of representing physical states by wave functions cannot be justified orproven. (But, as I suggested in Â§ 3.1, its consequences can be verified experimentally.) This postulate is one of the foundations upon which quantum mechanical theory is constructed : The First Postulate of Quantum Mechanics Every physically-realizable state of a system is described in quantum mechanics by a state function \\If that contains all accessible physical information about the system in that state. Note the word \"accessible\" in Postulate I. The information we can extract from a wave function is limited, and there is no getting around these limitations. For example, the uncertainties that lurk like little land mines in quantum theory prohibit us in principle from knowing the precise values of position and momentum of a microscopic particle. We cannot obtain precise values of these properties in any way-not by experimental measurement, not by theoretical calculation . But all we can know about such a particle is buried in its wave functions . And it is only in this sense that the theory of quantum mechanics can be described as \"complete.\" State functions come in many guises; they can be written as functions of momen- tum, of energy, of position . .. of any observable you wish. But, particularly in this book, you'll usually see wave functions written as functions of the spatial coordinates of the particles that comprise the system and of the time, to wit: Iw = w(position, time) I wave function Aside: States in Classical Physics. Notice how different this prescription for specifying a state is from the trajectories of Newtonian mechanics. In classical physics a particle's spatial coordinates are functions of time. But, as we saw in Chap. 2, paths are not allowed in descriptions of quanta. Therefore , in quantum physics position and time are independent quantities. Throughout Parts II and III of this volume, we'll consider several one-dimensional single-particle systems . For such a system, the position variable is x and the state function is simply w= w(x, t). (3.10) But we can trivially generalize this form to a single particle in three dimensions with position variable r , viz., W= w(r, t), or to a many-particle system, such as two particles in three dimensions , viz. W= w(rll r2, t). Such systems will come front-and-center in Volume II. (3.11) (3.12) 11 In more general and abstract treatments of quantum mechanics, a slate is represented by a vector in an infinite-dimensional linear. vector space caned a Hi/bert space. You need not worry now about this generalization, but if you are interested see the Selected Readings for this chapter. 58 Chap . 3 First Postulates Example 3.1. A Typical Wave Function One of the most important single-particle one-dimensional systems is the simple harmonic os- cillator: a particle of mass m moving in one dimension with potential'f V(x) = mw5x2/2. In Chap. 9 we'll find that one of the physically-realizable state functions for the simple harmonic oscillator has the functional form (3.13) Here A is the amplitude of the wave function , and E and (3 are constants related to various physical properties of the particle. (In particular, E is its total energy in the state represented by this wave function.) Notice that in general \\11(x, t) is complex-it is real only at particular times, such as t = O. This illustrates a property to which we'll return shortly: all state functions are, in general, complex; they are real only at special times. The function in (3.13), along with a few other state functions we'll meet in subsequent chapters, are on display in Fig. 3.1. Aside: Graphing State Functions. The complex nature of state functions poses some practical difficulties. For example, to graph a function such as (3.13) would require two three-dimensional graphs: one to show the real part of \\I1(x, t) as a function of x and t and one for the imaginary part. For this reason we usually look at \"snapshots\" of state functions-graphs in which time is \"frozen\" and we show only the dependence of \\11(x ,t) on its spatial coordinate . In considering state functions such as those in Fig. 3.1, you must keep in mind that physically these functions are position probability amplitudes-that's the idea we proposed in Â§ 3.I and that we'll make formal in Â§ 3.4. Hence the squared modulus of the state function, Iw(x,tW = w(x, t)*w(x, t), will playa crucial role in digging physical information out of this function. 13 Look at Fig. 3.I and try to envision the squared moduli of these functions. Notice that for each wave function you can find a (rather small) finite region of space where the probability of finding the particle is significantly larger than anywhere else. A state function that defines such a region of space is said to be spatially localized. Note this property well: Spatial localization is an extremely important property of state functions, for only functions that are spatially localized can represent quantum states. In Â§ 3.5 I'll show you how to translate this physical requirement into a mathematical constraint: the normalizability condition. The Principle of Superposition In Â§ 3.1 I emphasized the crucial role of superposition in explaining the behavior of electrons (and photons) in the double-slit experiment. Indeed, we introduced waves in the first place so we would have things to superpose. The identification of wave functions with quantum states lends a profound and very important significance to superposition in quantum mechanics: 12Strictly speaking, V(x) is the potential energy of the particle. Quantum physicists, however, refer to such functions as potemials, and, to stay in step, so will I. 13We must take account of the complex nature of the wave function when we form the probability distribution function; that is why we cannot write ['It(x ,tWoFor more on this matter, see Â§ 3.4. Sec. 3.2 Systems and States Thereof 59 'It(x, 0) (a) x -I:. 2 L '2 x x 'It(X, t) (b) x (e) x Figure 3.1 A complex of wave functions . \"Snapshots\" at t = 0 of the position probabil- ity amplitude for (a) a particle in a state represented by Eq.

The Principle of Superposition If \\lf1 and \\lf2 represent two physically-realizable states of a system, then the linear combi- nation \\If = C1\\lf 1 + C2 \\lf2, where C1 and C2 are arbitrary complex constants, represents a third physically-realizable state of the system. Actually, the Principle of Superposition is not restricted to linear combinations of only two quantum waves. In its most general form, this principle says that an arbitrary linear combination of any number--even an infinite number--of quantum waves repre- sents a new state of the system. More precisely: given N state functions of a system, {WI, '112 , '113 , â€¢â€¢â€¢ ,'11 N}, every linear combination 60 Chap. 3 First Postulates N '11 = LCiW i i = l (3.14) represents another state function. (The coefficients Ci are arbitrary and may be real or complex.) The essential physical content of the Principle of Superposition is that for any choice of coefficients Ci, Eq. (3.14) represents a state that can be realized in the laboratory. That is, we can construct from a given set of state functions an infinite number of other state functions, each new function corresponding to a different set of coefficients {C1 ,C2, . . . , CN}. And each linear combination we create represents a new physically-realizable state. I hope it's clear that the Principle of Superposition follows directly from our de- cision to represent physical states of microscopic particles by wave functions. This principle towers over the microworld, appearing time and time again in quantum physics and its applications. [In Chap. 6, for example, it will reappear in a particularly important property of the Schrodinger equation (linearity).] Remember it. *3.3 PROBABILITIES: A REVIEW In Â§ 3.1 we interpreted the quantum wave of a microscopic particle (an electron) in the double-slit experiment as a position probability amplitude. As we'll see in Â§ 3.4, this interpretation forms the backbone of quantum physics. In fact, the physical information contained in a state function is inherently probabilistic in nature. Hence probability theory is one of the most important mathematical and conceptual tools of every quantum mechanic. In this section we'll briefly review this topic, as preparation for Postulate 11.14 Ensembles In the real world, a rock concert is an event. But in the world of quantum physics, the word event refers to obtaining a particular result in a measurement of an observable on a microscopic system. For example, if we're interested in measuring the position of a ball rolling in the x direction along a linear track, we might ask: what is the probability of finding the ball at x = 10 m? The definition of probability we use in quantum mechanics is expressed in terms of such events. A probability is an inherently statistical quantity. That is, you can't define a probability in terms of a single system; you must do so by referring to a very large number of identical systems. These systems must also be independent of one another (i.e., not interacting with one another), and they must all be in the same physical state. A collection of identical systems that satisfies these criteria is called a statistical ensemble, or, more tersely, an ensemble. Take a moment to re-read, memorize, and ponder the concept of an ensemble; understanding ensembles is the key to understanding probabilities. The individual systems that comprise an ensemble are called its members. En- sembles are of special importance in quantum physics because in this discipline the word measurement refers to an ensemble measurement. To perform an ensemble measure- ment of an observable, we perform precisely the same experiment on the members of an ensemble of identical, non-interacting systems, all of which are in the same physical state. You may be wondering what, precisely, I mean by \"identical systems\". Well, this phrase means just what it sounds like: the members of the ensemble must be identical 14If you feel comfortable with probabilities, means, and standard deviations, skip or skim this section. If you want more information than you find here, try the excellent, detailed discussion of probability and statistics in Chap . 2 of Statistical Physics by F. Reif (New York: McGraw-Hili, 1965). In a lighter vein, see Lady Luck by W. Weaver (New York: Anchor Books, 1963). Sec. 3.3 Probabilities: A Review 61 in their composition and in all their intrinsic properties. For example, an ensemble for measuring the position of the ball on the linear track would consist of a huge number of identical balls on identical linear tracks. In setting up such an ensemble, we would have to ensure that not only the properties of particles in different members but also the external forces on each system (e.g., gravity or external electromagnetic fields) are the same. And we must ensure that all members of the ensemble are in the same state. For example, all balls must follow the same trajectory on their respective tracks. For a microscopic system this condition requires that all members be represented by the same wave function.15 \"Wait just a minute,\" you may be thinking, \"why would anyone ever carry out the same measurement on a huge number of identical systems all in the same physical state? Were I to do so, I would just get the same answer over and over again.\" Well, yes and no. To be sure, in principle all results of an ensemble measurement of an observable, such as position, on a macroscopic system would be the same.!\" But this is not true of a quantum system: identical experiments performed on identical systems in identical quantum states need not - and , in general, do not - yield the same results. Like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, this extraordinary statement is an intrinsic fact of nature, not a consequence of experimental imperfection. It would be no less true if the apparatus and the experimentalist using it were perfect! We'll return to this disquieting notion in Â§ 3.6. Probability Defined With all this chit-chat about ensembles out of the way, we are at last ready to define a probability. For the sake of clarity, we'll start with a position probability; we can trivially extend this definition to any observable. Suppose we perform an ensemble measurement of the position of a particle that is constrained to move in the x direction. (For the moment, I won't specify whether the particle is microscopic or macroscopic; for our present purposes the size of the system doesn't matter.) Each member of the ensemble exhibits a particular value of z , and, since the ensemble consists of a huge number of members, we wind up with a lot of data. To organize all this data, let's label the values we observe with an integral index j . Each different observed value of position gets a new integer, j = 1,2, 3, .. . , - on and on and on until we have labeled all the distinct values we obtained. Let M denote the maximum value of j . For convenience, we'll arrange the resulting indexed values in ascending sequence, viz., 15In his insightful article \"Probability Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\" [Amer. Jour . Phys., 48, 1029 (1980)] Roger Newton notes that since all members of an ensemble are physically identical, we can identify a particular ensemble by the physical properties of its members. Extending this point, Newton defines the state of a quantum system as \"[the symbolic representation of] the ensemble to which it belongs.\" 16But in the laboratory, members of an ensemble of macroscopic systems will yield different results, because of imprecision in the design and construction of the apparatus and in the experimentalist's technique. Consequently, such experiments must be carried out on an ensemble in order to determ ine the experimental error inherent in the measurement. It is not, however, experimental error but rather \"inherent imprecision\" that infects measurements in the microverse. 62 Chap. 3 First Postulates According to this scheme x M is the largest value of position exhibited by any member of the ensemble. Notice that if N is the total number of members in the ensemble, then M::; N . Now, if the ensemble is large enough (N Â» 1), then any particular value of x can (and probably will) occur several times. So a list of observed values doesn't fully describe the data. We must also note how many members exhibited each value Xj' Let's denote this number by nj' We can now display the result of our ensemble measurement as follows: Xl, X2, X3, X4,Â· .Â· nI, n2, n3, n4 ,'\" (3.15a) (3.15b) (3.100) But Eqs. (3.15) is a rather ungainly way to represent a large number of results- especially if our ensemble contained, say, 10,000 members. This information is more conveniently codified in a function: the probability of obtaining a particular value of x. Moreover, introducing such a function will make easier our subsequent generalization of probability theory to an infinite ensemble. We determine the probability of obtaining the value Xj in an ensemble measurement of position from the fraction of members that yielded this value. To calculate this quantity we merely divide the number of systems that exhibit xj-the number nj in (3.15b)-by the total number of experiments N: number of experiments that yield Xj nj total number of experiments = N' Now, the fraction nj/N depends explicitly on the number N of members in the ensemble. A more general quantity is the absolute position probability P(x), the generalization of (3.16a) to an infinite ensemble: n Â· P(x) == lim...1.. Absolute Position Probability (3.16b) N-+oo N Note carefully that I have written the absolute probability as a function of z , not of Xj; since the number of members in the ensemble described by (3.16b) is infinite, we must treat position as a continuous variable. Mathematical Aside: Absolute versus Relative Normalization. Dividing each nj by N in Eqs. (3.16)\"normalizes\" the valuesof nj by puttingthemon a common scale. By itself,each integernj describes only the relative probability that we will obtainXj. (For example, by comparing n3 to n7 we can ascertain onlythe likelihood that we will obtain X3 as opposed to X7.) But the fraction nj/N tells us the \"absolute\" likelihood of obtaining the value Xj . That's why P(x) is called the absolute probability. How could we represent pictorially the results of an ensemble measurement? Since ensembles in the lab are finite, only a finite number of values would be obtained in such a measurement; we could represent these data on a histogram, as in Fig. 3.2a. But the absolute probability P(x) is the extension of these data to an infinite ensemble. So this function is a continuous curve, as in Fig. 3.2b. Combinations and Normalization The algebra of probabilities in quantum mechanics is the same as in statistics. For example, suppose we must calculate the probability of obtaining one of two values Sec. 3.3 Probabilities: A Review 63 PIx) I I Xl X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 Xs X 7 Xs X -11+ X dx (al (b) Figure 3.2 Probability portraits. (a) A histogram displaying the results of a position measurement in which only eight values-e-ej through xs-were found. The vertical axis shows the frequency with which each value was obtained. (b) A plot of the absolute position probability P(x), which is obtained in the limit N -> 00 . The shaded area is the probability of finding the particle in the region X to X + dx. of position-say, X3 or X7. These events are mutually exclusive-i.e., if you get X3, you didn't get X7. According to the rule of combination of probabilities, the desired probability is simply the sum of the probabilities for each event, viz., (3.17) To calculate the probability of finding one of several values, we just generalize (3.17): the probability of obtaining any of the values Xl or X2 or X3 or . .. or XM is P(XI or ... or XM) = P(XI) + P(X2) + ...+ P(XM) M = LP(X j), j = l (3.18) where the summation includes all values of Xj in the list (3.15). This list includes every value obtained in the ensemble measurement. Since each member must exhibit one of these values, the \"combined probability\" (3.18) should equal 1. Let's see if it does. Using the definition of P(Xj) in (3.16a) we can write (3.18) as 1 M P(XI or X2 or ... orxM) = N L nj' j=l (3.19) But the sum of nj , the number of measurements that give Xi Â» over all possible values of X j equals N. So, as advertised, P(XI orX2 or .. . XM) = 1 [for a finite ensemble]. (3.20) This result follows because we normalized the individual probabilities in (3.160). For this reason, we call (3.20) a normalization condition. The Position Probability Density I noted above that in the limit N ~ 00 the probability must be written as a function of the continuous variable x. Properly, we should call the function P(x) a probability density, 64 Chap. 3 First Postulates because to calculate from this function the absolute probability, we must multiply it by an infinitesimal element of position dx. That is, the function P(x) is actually the position probability per unit length. The absolute probability of finding the particle at a value of x between, say, Xo and Xo + dx is P( Xo)dx.17 When we take account of the continuous nature of x and the limit in the definition (3.16b) of P(x), the normalization condition (3.20) becomes i: P(x)dx = 1. Normalization Condition (3.21) The Ensemble Average (3.22)[for a finite ensemble] . The probability density P(x) describes the results of an ensemble measurement of posi- tion. Appropriately, we characterize this kind of information as probabilistic informa- tion -a term which will become important later in this chapter. Another, more compact way to represent the same information is via statistical quantities, such as the ensemble average, which you may know under its colloquial name, the mean value. You know what I mean by the mean: To calculate, say, the mean grade of N students on a calculus exam, we just add their individual scores and divide the result by N. In this chapter, we're concerned with the mean value of position-a quantity we denote by (X).18 It's not hard to calculate this quantity for a measurement on a finite ensemble: we just add each Xj in (3.15a) nj times and divide the resulting sum by N. Alternately, we could calculate the ensemble average from the probability (3.160); viz., M (x) = LXj P(Xj) j=l The form of Eq. (3.22) makes sense. For a finite ensemble P( Xj) is the fraction of measurements that yield the value Xj-a quantitative measure of how important Xj is to (x). So we can treat this probability as a \"weighting factor\" for the position that is its argument. That is, we construct the average by multiplying each Xj by its weighting factor P( x j) and summing over all (distinct) values . But position is a continuous quantity, so the probability appropriate to a position measurement is the position probability density P(x) . To take this fact into account, we should alter slightly our definition (3.22) of the ensemble average (x), using an integral rather than a discrete sum. The probability of obtaining a value in the infinitesimal interval from x to x + dx is P( x )dx, so our expression for the ensemble average of position is (x) ==i:x P(x) dx. ensemble average (3.23) 17you may be wondering what it means to talk about finding a macroscopic particle in an infinitesimal interval of position. In a classical position measurement, such as the one we're discussing, the particle is said to be \"at x\" if its center of mass (a point) is at a: With this understanding, we can meaningfully discuss finding such a particle between XQ and XQ + dx. 18The use of angle brackets is standard in quantum mechanics, where the mean-also known as the ensemble average--{)f an observable Q is symbolized by (Q). You'll see more means in Chap. 5, where we study the property of generic observables. Sec. 3.3 Probabilities: A Review 65 In quantum theory, the mean value of position is called its expectation value. You'll be formally introduced to the expectation value in Â§ 3.6. Aside: What Does \"Mean\" Mean? You probably already have a good feeling for the mean. But a word of caution: Many novice quantum mechanics confuse the ensemble average of an observable with that observable's most probable value. The most probable value of position is not the mean value; it is the value of x at which the particle is most likely to be found. You can figure out the most probable value of position from P(x), but you probably won't get the value (x) . The distinction between these two quantities is illustrated in Fig. 3.3. p.(x) ( x ) =x most probable (a) x ( x ) (b) x Figure 3.3 Two probability densities that illustrate the difference between the most probable value of x (the dashed line) and the average value of x (the arrow). In (a) the symmetry of the probability density about the dashed line causes (x) to occur at the same place as the most probable x. But in (b) the probability density is skewed, so (x) is displaced to the right of the most probable value. The Dispersion The ensemble average is a useful piece of information. But it doesn't tell the whole story. For example, the mean value of the temperature in a normal year in Oklahoma is pretty close to 70Â° F; but this number by itself doesn't tell you that over the course of a typical year the temperature ranges from a nippy 10Â° or so below zero in the winter to a toasty 110Â° in the summer-infonnation you might well want if you're considering moving there. That is, by itself the mean temperature is deceptive. Far more information is communicated by probability densities, such as those in Fig. 3.4. The ensemble averages of position for these densities are the same, yet the probability functions themselves are quite different. The results described by the curve in Fig. 3.4a are all roughly the same: x ~ (x). In contrast, the data represented in Fig. 3.4b embraces a wide range of values about (x). Clearly, to describe the results of an ensemble measurement, we need a second number, one that describes the spread or fluctuation of individual results about their ensemble average. Happily, the theory of statistics provides such a number: the dispersion. The dispersion is a quantitative measure of the extent to which individual results fluctuate about the ensemble average.'? Together with the mean value, the dispersion HlThis quantity is also known as the variance or. more commonly. the mean square deviation . In many important applications it depends on time and so carries a t dependence ; see Pblm 1.2. 66 Chap. 3 First Postulates (x) (a) x (b) x Figure 3.4 Two probability densities that illustrate the limitations of the ensemble average (x). Individual results that give the narrow probability density in (a) fluctuate very little about (x)- and hence give a small standard deviation, in contrast to the broad distribution of (b). accurately yet compactly characterizes a large amount of data. For instance, the disper- sion of the temperature in Oklahoma is enormous; while that in Houston is small-it is the high mean value there that is the problem. The definition of the dispersion of a quantity comes to us from the theory of probability. For a position measurement, the dispersion of the results about (x) is defined as (Ax)2 == ( (x - (xÂ»2 ). dispersion (3.24) The right-hand side of (3.24) is not especially simple; it instructs us to take the average of the square of the difference between x and (x) . But you might as well commit it to memory; you're going to need it. This definition may seem somewhat arbitrary, but I think it makes sense. Since the dispersion is supposed to be a single number that characterizes the fluctuations of a large number of results about their mean, it is not surprising that this quantity be defined in terms of an average. But most other quantities we might consider, such as x - (x), are unsatisfactory. Can you deduce why? Question 3-1 Show that the mean value of x - (x) is zero. Also show that the dispersion as defined in (3.24) is necessarily non-negative. In statistics (and in quantum mechanics) fluctuations of data about their mean are usually described by the square root of the dispersion. This number is called the standard deviation: standard deviation (3.25) You need to get a feeling for the implications of a large (or small) standard deviation. A small Ax corresponds to the situation illustrated in Fig. 3.4a, where every member in the ensemble yields a value of x close to (x). A huge Ax, on the other hand, corresponds to the situation in Fig. 3.4b, where the data falls all over the place. Evidently, if the state Sec . 3.3 Probabilities: A Review 67 of a system is characterized by a very large dispersion in position, we don't know what to expect in a measurement of this observable. We are uncertainr'' Question 3-2 Consider experiments to measure the energy of (a) a racquetball confined to a cubical court, and (b) a conduction electron in a metal. Write down prescriptions for calculating the ensemble average and standard deviation for these measurements. 3.4 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO BORN Erwin with his psi can do Calculations quite a few. But one thing has not been seen Just what does psi really mean. -Walter Hilckel (translated by Felix Bloch) According to Postulate I, the wave function is the basic element of quantum physics: Every physical state of a quantum system is represented by a wave function III that contains all that we can know about the physical properties of the system in that state.2 1 But this postulate does not address the physical meaning of the wave function whose existence it hypothesizes. The interpretation of the state function is crucial to its use: we must know how to extract physical information from this function. But at present we know only that III is complex and depends on position and time; as such, it seems resistant to straightforward physical interpretation. Since the early days of quantum physics this issue-just what does the state function mean?-has been a source of controversy. Since the 1930s physicists have known how to calculate state functions and use them to predict and explain the physics of a wide range of microscopic systems; but they have been unable to agree on an interpretation of these functions. In his excellent book The Quantum Physicists and an Introduction to their Physics (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970), William H. Cropper summarizes the situation thusly: The modem physicist is forced to admit, with some embarrassment, that although he can formulate a powerful and beautiful mathematical theory of atomic and molecular behavior, he cannot be sure he knows exactly what that theory means. To be sure, the literature of quantum physics is replete with different interpretations of the state function-some of which are pretty wild (see the Selected Readings for 20you guessed it: In quantum mechanics ilx is the position uncertainty. As we'll learn in Â§ 3.6, the uncertainty for a given state is calculated from the wave function of the state. 21Actually , there exist in nature states that cannot be represented by a wave function. These states are called mixed states; a quantum state that can be represented by a wave function is called a pure state. The distinct ion between mixed and pure states is beyond our scope at present, but I should note the condition for a pure state: A system is in a pure state if it is impossible, by any measurement, to distinguish one member of the ensemble from any other member. For more on mixed states, take a look at Compliment E of Chapter III in Quantum Mechanics , Volume I by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Bernard Diu, and Franck Laloe (New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1977) or at the more specialized and advanced treatise Density Matrix Theory and Applications by Karl Blum (New York: Plenum, 1981). 68 Chap. 3 First Postulates this chapter). But none can be proven correct. In this book, I'll show you the most widely held view of quantum mechanics: the Copenhagen Interpretation. This theory is founded on an interpretation of the state function due to Max Born (1882-1970). We've already used this interpretation (although I didn't identify it as such) in Â§ 3.1. There we explained the behavior of electrons in the double-slit experiment by associating with them a \"quantum probability wave.\" This is Born's idea:22 wave function \\II = position probability amplitude Although it's easy to express this notion mathematically, to fully understand it we must delve more deeply into the meaning of measurement in quantum mechanics. The Meaning of a Measurement on a Quantum System Were we concerned with macroscopic (classical) physics, we could discuss experiments on individual systems . That is, because information about observables for a macroscopic system is not inherently probabilistic, we don't have to talk about such experiments in terms of ensembles-although it's often useful to do so. But, as already noted, the situation in the microscopic universe is quite different. Quantum mechanics speaks the language of probabilities, and as discussed in the last section, probabilities are defined in terms of ensembles. This feature of quantum theory is of paramount importance : Rule Quantum mechanics describes the outcomes of ensemble measurements, where an ensemble measurement consists of a very large number of identical experiments performed on iden- tical, non-interacting systems alI of which have been identicalIy prepared so as to be in the same state. In quantum physics , a state is specified by a wave function, so when we say \"the members of the ensemble are in the same state,\" we mean that they are represented by the same wave function. This vital definition is summarized in Fig. 3.5. Aside: Ensembles versus Individual Systems. It's not unrealistic for us to restrict quantum theory to statements about ensembles (rather than about individual systems). Most laboratory experiments are performed on ensembles of microscopic systems. For example, in a typical collision experiment, we fire a beam of particles-say, electrons-at a dilute gas of target particles-say, sodium (Na) atoms. IdealIy, the particles in the beam would be mono-energetic (i.e., they would alI have the same energy) and would not interact with one another. (ActualIy, the particles' energy is uncertain, and the experimentalist tries to set up conditions that reduce interactions to a minimum.) Such a beam is the most famous example of a quantum ensemble, because prior to the colIision alI particles in it are in the same state. The same must be true of the target atoms. We could enforce this condition by using a laser to ensure that alI the Na atoms are in the same state before colIision. We could then perform alI sorts of interesting experiments: for example, we could 221n this chapter we'll explore the Born interpretation only for position. But as you work through Volume I, you'll learn how to construct probability amplitudes for other observables te.g., momentum in Â§ 4.6). Remember that the only thing special about position is that it's the focus of this chapter. Sec. 3.4 The Gospel According to Born 69 Result of position measurement Xl X l Xl Figure 3.5 A schematic representation of a quantum ensemble. In this figure, the (microscopic) system is represented by a little box. The en- semble is constructed by replicating the system many times; the total number of members in the ensemble is N. (Note that N should be huge.) All member systems must be prepared in the same way so that prior to measurement they are in the same state. I have indicated this important condition by labelling each member (box) by the symbol lIt. (This stale function therefore labels the ensemble as a whole.) measure the energy levels of Na atoms by observing the frequencies of photons emitted when excited Na atoms decay after excitation by electrons. Each individual system consists of an electron and a Na atom, but we perform the experiment on an ensemble of such systems. So a physicist who says \"we measure the energy of the Na atom\" actually means \"we simultaneously determine the energy of all members of the ensemble of Na atoms.\" Our mission is to calculate the state function for the system and use this function to predict and explain the results of such measurements. The Born Interpretation Let's now codify Born's solution to the problem of how to get information out of a quantum state function in another postulate . The plan, recall, is to interpret such a function as a probability amplitude-a quantity whose squared modulus is a probability density. Expressed in terms of position, this new postulate reads: The Second Postukue of Quantum Mechanics If a system is in a quantum state represented by a wave function '11, then P dv = 11It1 2 dv is the probability that in a position measurement at time t the particle will be detected in the infinitesimal volume element dv. For a one-dimensional, single-particle system the wave function is simply a function of x and t, and the position probability density is IIJ1(x,tWo So for such a system, the Born interpretation asserts that P(xo, t) dx is the probability of finding the particle at time t in an infinitesimal region dx about the particular point X(). It's easy to generalize this postulate to systems in (two or) three dimensions and even to systems that consist of many particles. For example, the probability density for a single particle in three dimensions in a state represented by the wave function lJ1(r, t) is P(r , t) = IIJ1(r, tW = 1J1*(r, t)lJ1(r, t) . The probability of finding such a particle in an infinitesimal three-dimensional volume element d3r about r() is just what you would expect: P(ro , t) dv = 1J1*(ro, t)lJ1(ro, t) dv. 70 Chap. 3 First Postulates Note that the absolute value bars in Born's expression Iwl 2 for the probability density are essential: this density must be real, but in general the wave function W is complex. The probability density must be real because it appears in quantum mechanical expressions for quantities such as the mean value of position (see Â§ 3.6)-quantities that could be measured in the laboratory and hence must be real numbers. Example 3.2. An Ensemble of Square Wells In Part IV, we'll investigate several applications of quantum mechanics to single-particle, one-dimensional systems. One of the most important of these is the symmetric infinite square well shown in Fig. 3.6a.23 The probability amplitudes (state functions) and corresponding position probability densities (at time t = 0) for several states of the square well are graphed in Fig. 3.6b. The wave functions in Fig. 3.6b illustrate some important, peculiar features of quantum states. For example, in the state represented by W2, the probability of finding the particle at t = 0 in an infinitesimal \"volume\" element dx about the position Xo = L/4 is quite large. This fact seems simple, but it is really rather subtle. Each member of the ensemble-i.e., each particle in its box-is either in the volume element centered on Xo = L/4 or it isn't; what W2 tells us is that in an ensemble measurement of position, a large number of members will exhibit a value very near or equal to Xu = L/4. In contrast, the probability of finding a particle in a volume element near Xo = 0 is very small. [Notice that the wave function is zero at X = 0, so the probability P2(0, 0) dx = IW2(0, oWdx is also zero at that point.] The Integrated Probability In a real experiment we cannot locate a particle at a point; at best we may be able to determine if the particle is in a very small but finite region of position values-e.g., in the interval from x = a to x = b. So we need to know how to calculate the probability of finding the particle somewhere in a finite region. (Since we cannot measure position more accurately than this, we don't care where in the region the particle is.) Such a calculation poses no logical problem: we merely sum the individual probabilities P(x, t)dx for all values of 3; in the interval [a, b]. Now, for a continuous variable such as x, \"sum\" means \"integrate,\" so the desired probability is probability of detection in [a,b] == P( [a, b] ,t) =l b P(x, t) dx = l b Iw(x, tW dx Interlude: What Quantum Mechanics Can't Do (3.26) Born's idea, as codified in Postulate II, provides the vital link between the mathematical function wand the physical state it represents. Armed with this interpretation such physicists as Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger rapidly developed the machinery for extracting from wave functions information about position, momentum, and a host of other observables. We'll explore their work in Chap. 5 and Part IV. 23The particle in a square well is no mere academic example; in current research it is used to model a variety of physical systems, such as conduction electrons in some solids and electrons in certain organic molecules. You'll see an example of what [ mean in Â§ 8.9.

(c) At t = O. a particle in state 'I' 2 is quite likely to be found in the \"volume\" element dx at XQ = L/4. Still, although quantum mechanics is quite powerful, there are some questions that it simply does not address. These limitations are best explained by example. Consider an ensemble consisting of, say, Avogadro's number of radioactive nuclei. Each nucleus of each atom is in the same quantum state as every other nucleus. Nuclei decay. So, pondering the future of our ensemble, we might formulate two questions: 72 Chap. 3 First Postulates 1. What is the likelihood that in a particular time interval any nucleus in the ensemble will decay? 2. Will a particular nucleus decay in this time interval? The first of these queries addresses the behavior of the collection of identical systems that comprise the ensemble. Since quantum physics pertains to ensembles, it can, in principle , provide an answer to this question. But the second question concerns the behavior of a specific member of an ensemble. Such a question is beyond the scope of any theory that speaks only the language of ensemble probabilities. In fact, individual nuclei in such an ensemble decay at different times. But Copenhagen quantum physics cannot explain this fact, except to argue that the behavior of a particular member of an ensemble is governed by random chance. This viewpoint, you might guess, takes a little getting used to. 3.5 HOW TO NORMALIZE A STATE FUNCTION In our review of probabilities (Â§ 3.3), I noted that the absolute probability density P(x) obeys the normalization condition [Eq. (3.21)] i: P(x)dx = 1. (3.27) We must ensure that quantum-mechanical probability densities, as calculated from state functions, satisfy this condition . In this section, we'll see how to enforce the normaliza- tion condition-an ability we'll need throughout the rest of our journey through quantum physics . The Normalization Condition The importance of normalization follows from the Born interpretation of the state function as a position probability amplitude . According to Â§ 3.4, we interpret the integrated probability density on the left-hand side of (3.27) as the probability that in a position measurement at time t we will find the particle anywhere in space. [This integral is just the generalization of the one in Eq. (3.26) to all space: a = -00 and b = +00.] Now, think physically for a moment: what should be the value of this integral? The particle does exist, so this integral must equal 1. All this is to say that for the Born interpretation of a state function to make sense, the position probability density calculated from the state function must be an absolute probability density . As such, it must satisfy the normalization condition (3.27), which we write: i:P(x, t)dx =i:III(x, t)*IlI(x, t)dx = 1 Normalization Condition (3.28a) A bit of jargon: The integral over all space of the probability density is sometimes called the normalization integral; and a mathematical function III whose normalization integral equals 1 is said to be normalized.P' 241n mathematics. functions satisfying (3.28) are said to be \"square-integrable.\" For more on the mathematical underp innings of quantum theory, see 1. M. Jauch, Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (Reading Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1968). Sec. 3.5 How to Normalize a State Function 73 You should have little trouble generalizing the normalization condition (3.28a) to simple three-dimensional systems. Consider a single particle in three dimensions in a state represented by the wave function 'l1(r, t) . The normalization integral is the probability of finding the particle anywhere in space, so in this case we must integrate over all space-i.e., we require a three-fold integral with respect to the infinitesimal volume element dv = d3r: J'l1(r, t)* 'l1(r, t) dv = 1. (3.28b) Sometimes we find (or derive) a wave function whose normalization integral doesn't satisfy the normalization condition. If this integral is finite , then we can fix the wave function-we can normalize it, using a procedure I'll describe in a moment. A function that can be normalized is, sensibly, said to be normalizable. In physics, nonnalizable functions are particularly important, for only nonnalizable functions can represent a quantum state. For this reason, we say that such functions are physically admissible. But if the normalization integral is infinite, we're in trouble. Such a function can- not be normalized and hence cannot properly represent a quantum state. 25 The reason is that we can't meaningfully interpret the squared modulus of a function whose normal- ization integral is infinite as a probability density. The probability of finding the particle anywhere in space in a position measurement is not infinity; it's unity. The normalization condition exemplifies the beautiful interplay of physics and mathematics that characterizes quantum mechanics. Here a physical constraint-that a quantum particle must exist-<:orresponds to a mathematical limitation on the class of functions that can represent states in nature. As we proceed, you should be on the alert for other strands in the fabric of mathematics and physics that is quantum mechanics. You may find, as I do, that these are among the most marvelous features of this remarkable physical theory. Aside: The Constancy of Normalization. Another (equally sensible) consequence of the normalization conditions (3.28) is that the integral J::x. w(x , t)*w(x, t) dx doesn't depend on the time. Obviously, the probability of detecting the particle anywhere is unity no matter when we perform the measurement. So a function once normalized, stays normalized. To prove this fact, we need the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation, which will appear in Chap. 6 (see Â§ 6.5). The Normalization Requirement and Boundary Conditions The demand that the normalization integral equal 1 constrains the mathematical form of the wave function in a rather subtle way. Many novice quantum mechanics incor- rectly infer from the normalization condition that the state function itself cannot extend throughout space-i.e., that 'l1(x, t) must be non-zero only in a finite region of space. Although reasonable, this deduction is wrong. To avoid such logical pitfalls, we must always focus on precisely what the equations of quantum mechanics mean. Equation (3.28a) doesn't prohibit a wave function 'l1(x, t) 25Notice the qualifier properly. As we'll see in Chap. 8, there exist solutions to the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation that are mathematically valid but not physically admissible because their normalization integral is infinite. Yet, non-normalizable functions play an important role in quantum mechanics, especially in the study of scattering processes. 74 Chap . 3 First Postulates from having infinite extent, if as x approaches Â±oo, the function decays to zero rapidly enough that the normalization integral is finite. So the condition that follows logically from this equation is W(x, t) - 0 as [z ] - 00 rapidly enough. (3.29) We'll illustrate this condition in Example 3.3. Equation (3.29) is called a \"boundary condition\" on the function W(x, t), because it is a condition that function must satisfy at a \"boundary.,,26 I'll have more to say about boundary conditions in Chap. 6, and we'll explore their consequences throughout the remainder of this book. How to Normalize Enough abstract theory. Suppose we're confronted with a function w'(x, t) whose nor- malization integral is equal to a finite number other than 1: i:w'(x, t)*W'(x, t) dx = M . (3.30) What to do? I'm sure you're ahead of me. To obtain from w'(x, t) a function whose normal- ization integral is unity we just multiply the offending function by the constant 1/VM. The resulting function W(x, t) = Juw'(x, t) satisfies the desired condition [normalized state function] (3.31a) (3.31b) and so is physically admissible. [Of course, if the integral in Eq. (3.30) is infinite, this gambit fails spectacularly.] Example 3.3. Subduing a Normalizable State Function To see how the normalization procedure works, let's return to the wave function of a particle with a simple harmonic oscillator potential that we saw in Example 3.2 [Eq. (3.13)]: (3.320) Evaluating the normalization integral for the function (3.32a), we find (3.32b) 26you may be wondering where the \"boundary\" in (3.29) is. The name \"boundary condition\" evokes a condition that a function must satisfy at some point . But Eq. (3.29) is a condition the wave function must satisfy in the limit Ixl -+ 00. Nevertheless, in the parlance of the field, such a requirement is called a boundary condition. Sec. 3.5 How to Normalize a State Function 75 (Notice what happened to the time dependence in the normalization integral.) Clearly, W'(x, t) is nonnalizable-and hence physically admissible (i.e., this function can repre- sent a quantum state). But, equally clearly, its normalization integral isn't equal to 1. This defect is easily remedied: we just choose the \"normalization constant\" A in (3.32a) so that A 2 = JfJ2/1r, i.e., (3.32c) This choice gives as the normalized counterpart of W'(x , t), the function (3.33) [You can find a graph of this function (at t = 0) in Fig. 3.1a.] Since the Gaussian function (3.32a) can be normalized, it is a viable candidate for stare-function-hood.\" Before I leave this example, I want to reinforce its moral: Rule Unless you know that a state function is normalized, your first step-before you calculate anything physical from the function-should be to check that it is nonnalizable and, if so, to normalize it. Quantum Arbitrariness Example 3 illustrates one way to construct a normalized function. \"But,\" you may be wondering, \"is my newly normalized function W(x, t) = Ju W'(x, t) (3.34) unique: is it the onLy normalized function I can construct from w'(x , t)?\" The answer- which may surprise you-lurks in the Born interpretation. RecalI that the normalization condition is expressed in terms of the position proba- bility density-the product Iw(x, tW = W(x, t)*w(x, t) . Consequently we can multiply the state function by any complex number of unit moduLus without changing the prob- ability density. That is, we can multiply w(x, t) by ei6 , where 8 is any real number, without changing the normalization integral.28 In the probability density constructed from ei6w(x,t), alI dependence on 8 disappears because (3.35) 27There are, however, restrictions other than normalizability that a prospective state function must satisfy if it is to represent a quantum state. I'll discuss some of these mathematical conditions at the end of this section. Beyond these, a state function must satisfy the equation of motion of the system-the time-dependent SchrOdinger Equation (see Chap. 6). 28Any complex number z whose modulus is unity can be written as z = ei~ for some real number 6. If this assertion isn't familiar, take a few minutes to review Appendix K. 76 Chap. 3 First Postulates Ergo all functions of the form '6 1 \\l1(x, t) = et -1M \\l1/(x, t) lead to the same normalization integral: (3.36) 1\\l1(x, tW = \\l1(x, t)* \\l1(x, t) [ - i6 ] = Ju \\l1/(x, t)* = ~ 1\\l1/(x,t) 1 2 â€¢ [ ei6 ] -1M \\l1' (x, t) (3.37) Regardless of the value of 0 (which may, of course, be zero), the function (3.36) will obey the normalization condition (3.28). We have discovered that the wave function-the state descriptor of quantum physics- is, to an extent, arbitrary! This result should strike you as a bit odd; it certainly doesn't pertain to the more familiar state descriptor of classical physics: the trajectory that rep- resents a particular classical state of a particle is unique. The factor ei 6 is called a global phase factor, so what we've learned is: a state function is arbitrary to within a global phase factor. I view this \"quantum arbitrariness\" as an artifact of the theory. (A useful artifact, because quantum arbitrariness often comes in handy in problem solving .) By this I mean that we cannot detect the arbitrariness of the state function via measurement. As we'll soon see, the global phase factor vanishes from all quantum mechanical expressions for quantities we can measure. This disappearing act works for the same reason the phase factor vanished from the probability density in (3.35): quantum mechanical expressions for measurable quantities inevitably involve the probability density , which is the product \\l1* \\l1. Fonn this product, and Eq. (3.35) will eliminate the phase factor for you. For instance, we cannot distinguish by any physical measurement the states repre- sented by the functions and '6et \\l1(x, t) = \\l1(x, t) e i 6 \\l1(x, t) = -\\l1(x, t) (0 = 0) (o=rr) (3.38a) (3.38b) The point to remember is: Rule Two state functions that differ only by a global phase factor, lit and ei6 11t, represent the same physical state of the system. Additional Restrictions on the Wave Function We have seen how the physical fact that (even in the weird world of quantum mechanics) a particle must exist somewhere restricts the class of physically admissible functions to Sec. 3.5 How to Normalize a State Function 77 those that are nonnalizable. But nonnalizability is not the only mathematical condition a function must satisfy if it is to represent a quantum state. The first of these conditions follows from the Born interpretation of the state function as a position probability amplitude. At any time the value of the probability for finding the particle in an infinitesimal region of space must be unique. This implies that the state function must assume only one value at each time-i.e., that it must be single-valued. Consider, for contrast, the multi-valued beast in Fig. 3.7a. Since the squared modulus of this function has two values, it can't be understood as a position probability density. Hence this double-valued function is useless as a state descriptor in quantum physics. Additional restrictions follow from the equation of motion of quantum mechanics: the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation. We'll study this equation, which towers over the many and varied implementations and applications of quantum physics, in Chap. 6. But, by way of preview, here it is for a particle in one dimension with potential energy V(x) : ~ ~ . a---a2 IIJ(x, t) + V(x)lIJ(x, t) = 'tn-a IIJ(x, t). (3.39) 2m x t What conditions follow from this equation? Look at its first term. See the second derivative of IIJ(x, t) with respect to x? Speaking mathematically, we cannot even define this derivative unless the first derivative of the function in question, IIJ(x, t), is continuous.P Mathematicians call a function whose first derivative is everywhere continuous a smoothly varying function. So we conclude that the wave function must be smoothly varying. It can't have any kinks (see Fig. 3.7c). Another condition also follows from the presence of the second derivative a211J(x, t)/ax2 in the Schrodinger equation (3.39). We define the second derivative in terms of the first derivative, and we can define the first derivative only if the function being differentiated is itself continuous. Incidentally, the Born interpretation provides another incentive to require that IIJ(x, t) be continuous: if it weren't, then at a point of discontinuity, the value of its modulus squared would not be unique, in which case we could not meaningfully interpret this value as the position probability density. To summarize: Rule A function is physically admissible and hence may represent a state of a quantum system if it is single-valued, continuous, smoothly varying, and normalizable-and if it satisfies the system's Schrodinger Equation (3.39). Aside: The Finiteness of Wave Functions. State functions are also finite at all points-usually. But don't misconstrue this observation as a requirement; a state function can be infinite at a point provided that the mathematical nature of this singularity is such that the normalization integral formed from the function is finite. We'll come across some examples of this curiosity when (in Part V) we focus on three-dimensional systems. 29For a proof of this assertion, see Chap. 2 of Quantum Physics by Rolf G. Winter (Belmont, Ca.: Wadswonh, (979). If you want to read further on the mathematical requirements of wave functions, see the aforementioned book by Jauch. 78 Chap. 3 First Postulates 'It(x.O) 'It (x. 01 Ok Ok 'It(x.O) x (a) Single-valued 'It(x.O) x (b) Continuous Not ok Notok x x 'It(x, 0) Ok 'It(x.O) x x Not ok (e) Smoothly varying Figure 3.7 Valid and useless one-dimensional functions. In each case. the functions sketched on the right of this figure are not physically admissible. They fail because they are not (a) single-valued; (b) continuous; and (c) smoothly-varying. The functions on the left are Ok. 3.6 GREAT EXPECTATIONS (AND UNCERTAINTIES) The Born interpretation enables us to determine from a wave function a particular kind of information: probabilistic information, We can use the probability density to answer the question: in an ensemble measurement of position at time t, what is the probability that a member of the ensemble will exhibit a value in the infinitesimal range from x to x + dx? But in Â§ 3.3 I introduced another kind of information: statistical information, To characterize the results of an experiment, we use two statistical quantities-the ensemble average and the standard deviation. These are, respectively, the mean value of the results Sec . 3.6 Great Expectations (and Uncertainties) 79 and a measure of the extent to which these results fluctuate around the mean. For the observable we're considering in this chapter, position, the ensemble average is denoted by (x) and the uncertainty by Ax. But how do we calculate these quantities from a state function? The answer follows easily from their definitions and the Born Interpretation. The Expectation Value In quantum theory, the ensemble average of an observable for a particular state of the system is called the expectation value of that observable. Thus, (x) answers the question: what is the average of the results that would be obtained in an ensemble measurement of position performed at time t on a system in a state represented by III(x, t)? To obtain an expression for (x) we need only adapt the definition (3.23) of the ensemble average (the mean) to quantum mechanics. This definition, (x) =i:x P(x) dx, instructs us to integrate over all values of x (i.e., over the whole range of the spatial coordinate of a one-dimensional wave function), thereby accumulating the product of each possible value of the observable x and its \"weighting function\" P(x, t). Using Postulate II to write the probability density in terms of III(x, t), we obtairr'? (x) ==i:x P(x, t) dx = i:III(x, t)* x III(x , t) dx. Expectation Value of Position (3.40a) Notice that we must integrate over the whole \"space\" of the wave function . For a one- dimensional system, this entails only a single integration from -00 to +00 . But for a single particle in three dimensions, we must write the expectation value as an integration over three spatial coordinates, with the differential volume element dv; viz., (x) = f llI(r, t)* x llI(r, t) dv. (3.40b) Now, (x) is the average of data from a position measurement on an ensemble of particles in state Ill. This value can be determined in the laboratory and hence must be a real number. And, sure enough, it is. Since the probability density 1lI*1lI is a real function, and the spatial coordinate x assumes only real values, the integrals (3.40) are also real.3 1 Question 3-3 Write the state function w(x, t) as the sum of real and imaginary parts and prove that P(x, t) is real. 30lt may seem perverse to put x in between lJt(x, t)* and lJt(x, t) in this definition. But this fonn for expectation values is standard-for reasons that will become clear in Chap. 5. 31 Any number c with the property that c\" = c is real. This property (see Appendix K) provides one way to prove that (x) is real. 80 Chap. 3 First Postulates Before turning to a sample calculation of an expectation value, I want to note some of the important properties of this quantity. First, in the definitions (3.40) we integrate only over spatial variables. So in general, the expectation value (x) depends on time. From time to time, I'll explicitly indicate this dependence, writing the expectation value with the slightly ungainly notation (x) (t). A second important property of this quantity is its dependence on the state of the system: different quantum states, represented by different state functions, have different ensemble averages. This statement sounds obvious, but, perhaps because this depen- dence is not explicitly indicated by the symbol for the expectation value, it's easy to overlook. Figure 3.8 illustrates the state-dependence of (x) by comparing the probability densities and corresponding expectation values for two states of the finite square well (see Example 3.2). p. Ix, t) ; 1'It. lx, t) 12 x x Figure 3.8 Snapshots at fixed times t of two probability densities for the finite square well and the corresponding expectation values. Clearly, (x) depends on the state of the system. Example 3.4. Expectation Value of Position for a Particle Consider a microscopic particle with a simple harmonic oscillator potential in a quantum state represented by the wave function we normalized in Example 3.3. To simplify the algebra in this, our first example, let's suppose that the properties of the oscillator are such that the constant 13 = 1, leaving the more general case for Chap. 9. In this case the wave function (3.33) is simply ,T,( ) ( 1 ) 1/4 _\",2/2 - ieuÂ« '\" X , t = - e e . 11\" (3.41) Let's calculate the average value we would obtain in a measurement at t = 0 of the position of an ensemble of particles in this state. According to the definition (3.40a), the expectation value of X at t = 0 for this state is (x) = Ifi:xe- x 2 dx. (3.42) To evaluate this integral, we could dive for our integral tables and start scribbling. Or we could think for a moment. I recommend the latter approach. When faced with a manipulation of this sort, the first thing you ought to do is to check the parity of the integrand: i.e., determine if it is an even or an odd funcrion.\" So let's 32Recall that the parity of a function f(x) is even if f( - x) = f(x) and is odd if f( -x) = - f(x) . Sec. 3.6 Great Expectations (and Uncertainties) 81 examine the integrand in Eq. (3.42), which I'll call I(x). This function, I(x) = xe- x 2 , is odd. because I(-x) = -I(x). But the integral from -00 to +00 of any odd function is necessarily zero. Equation (3.42) contains just such an integral, so we conclude that (x) = 0 (1)1/4 2 for \\I1(x,O) =;;: e- x /2. (3.43) Question 3-4 Does Eq. (3.43) hold for t > 07 Prove your answer. By the way, be careful when you interpret a result such as Eq. (3.43). In particular, be wary of deducing from a statistical quantity, such as the mean value, conclusions about the nature of the ensemble on which the measurement was performed. For example, we can imagine two quite different ensembles that would yield (x) = 0: 1. an ensemble all members of which exhibit x = 0 in the position measurement; 2. an ensemble such that each member that yields a non-zero value, say xo, is \"matched\" by a member that yields -Xo . In a measurement on the second ensemble, an equal fraction of members exhibit +x and -x, so the mean is zero. We cannot distinguish between these two cases without additional information-which you will find later in this section. The Expectation Value of a Generic Observable Most observables can be written as functions of position and momentum. We'll tackle the quantum mechanical treatment of momentum in Chap. 5 and so will defer until then the question of how to calculate the expectation value of an arbitrary observable. But many observables are functions of position only, and we know enough to write down the form of the expectation value for such an observable. Let's denote by Q(x) a generic observable that depends only on position. Suppose the experimental physicists down the hall have built an apparatus that can carry out an ensemble measurement of Q(x). Our job is to calculate from the state function, which in this scenario we've already obtained by solving the Schrodinger equation (Chap. 6), the average value that the folks down the hall ought to expect. To write down the expression for (Q(x)) we return, once again, to the probability density and the Born interpretation. Consider a point Xo in an infinitesimal element dx. The product of P(xo, t) dx is the probability of detecting a particle in the interval dx at time t. Now, the value of Q(x) at this point is Q(xo), so the probability of obtaining this value in the measurement of Q(x) is just P(xo, t) dx. That is, we can use the position probability density as the weighting factor in a calculation of the expectation value of any observable that depends only on position , to wit: (Q(x)) = i:w*(x, t) Q(x) w(x, t) dx. (3.44) Note carefully that this simple generalization does not apply to an observable that depends on both position and momentum. 82 Chap. 3 First Postulates The Uncertainty The other statistical quantity we use in quantum physics is the standard deviation of an observable-{)therwise known as its uncertainty. For a position measurement, the uncertainty in x answers the question: in an ensemble measurement at time t of the position of a particle in state \\l1(x,t), what is the spread of individual results around the expectation value (x)? We reviewed the definition of the standard deviation in Â§ 3.3. We can now adapt this definition to quantum states just as we did the definition of the mean.The standard deviation is the square root of the dispersion . According to the definition (3.25), this quantity, written here for position, is Position Uncertainty (3.45a) Unfortunately, this definition is easier to write down than to apply. Let's ponder it in detail. Using our definitions for the expectation values, here are our instructions: 1. calculate the expectation value of position, (x); 2. form the function x - (x); 3. square the function determined in step (2); 4. calculate the expectation value of the result of step (3); 5. take the square root of the resulting number. Mercifully, we don't have to do all this every time we need to calculate an uncer- tainty. There is an easier way: use the simpler, more convenient, equivalent expression (3.45b) (3.46) This result lets us calculate the position uncertainty for a quantum state from the expec- tation values of x and of x 2 â€¢ The form of (x 2 ) follows from the generalization (3.44), viz., (x 2 ) = I: \\l1*(x,t) x 2 \\l1(x, t) dx . Much simpler, right? More good news: Eq. (3.45b) leads to a host of other time-saving results. One of the most useful is: Ax = J(x 2 ) if (x) = O. (3.47) Question 3-5 I hope it's clear how Equation (3.45b) simplifies the chore of figuring out uncertainties. This result is so important that you really ought to derive it. Do so. Example 3.5. The Position Uncertainty for a Microscopic Particle Let's return one last time to the state function (3.41) at t = O. Recall that in Example 3.4 we evaluated the expectation value of position for this state and found that because the wave function is symmetric about x = 0, this quantity is zero. Now let's calculate the uncertainty ~x. If we use Eq. (3.45b) rather than the definition (3.45a), we need evaluate only one additional integral, the expectation value of x 2 : Sec. 3.6 Great Expectations (and Uncertainties) 83 2 /11 00 2 _\",2 (X ) = V;: -00 X e dx. (3.48) This integral isn't particularly challenging. First we exploit the even parity of its integrand to rewrite it as 1 00 1002 \",2 2 \",2 X e\" dx = 2 X e\" dx . -00 0 Then, ploughing through our trusty integral tables (or Appendix I), we find 1 00 2 _\",2 1 X e dx = -..;:;r. o 4 This gives (x 2 ) = 1/2. We can now evaluate the position uncertainty for this state, (3.49) (3.50) (1)1/4 2 for lIf(x,O) =;: e-'\" /2 . (3.51) Equation (3.51) answers the question left dangling at the end of Example 3.4: what is the nature of the ensemble that gave (x) = 0 for this state? Clearly it was not an ensemble an members of which exhibited the same value; had this been the case, an data points would have been the same and we'd have found Ax = O. No, it was one in which the position of the particle was uncertain, and the quantity we have here calculated is a quantitative measure of that uncertainty. You can see this feature of the state in the snapshot of its wave function in Fig. 3.9.

(b) The corresponding probability density. 84 Chap. 3 First Postulates Just as in Eq. (3.44) we generalized the definition of (x) to an arbitrary observable that can be expressed as a function of x , so can we generalize the definition (3.45) of ~x to such an observable, viz., (3.52) As you might guess, in actual calculations we usually implement the alternative expres- sion [~Q(X)12 = ([Q(xW) - (Q(X))2. (3.53) Expectation values and uncertainties are of paramount importance to the user of quantum mechanics. Once we have learned how to calculate state functions and how to represent observables that depend on position and momentum, we'll be applying the definitions of this section over and over. So remember them. 3.7 FINAL THOUGHTS: WHAT THE STATE FUNCTION ISN'T As if by magic, Postulates I and IT have transformed de Broglie's vague notion of a matter wave into a beautiful mathematical construct: the state function. The Born Interpretation of this function, the bulwark of quantum theory, defines the very character of that theory as intrinsically probabilistic, statistical-and limited. From state functions, we can calculate probabilities for various outcomes of measurements and such statistical quantities as the average value and the uncertainty. But nothing more. Even so simple a question as \"Where is a particular electron\" is beyond the purview of quantum mechanics. At most, a quantum physicist can determine the probability of finding one of an ensemble of electrons at a particular location, the mean value of the positions obtained in an ensemble measurement, the position where an electron is most likely to be found, and a rough measure of the size of the region where most of the electrons will appear. In this chapter we've begun to learn how to do such calculations. Other, more philosophical questions also are beyond quantum mechanics. For example, in this chapter I have talked a lot about \\11 but have not addressed questions such as: what, precisely, is this function? Where does it exist? In ordinary, geometrical space, like an electromagnetic wave? And what is the nature of its connection to the material system whose state it represents? I've dodged such questions because they lie on the fringes of orthodox quantum theory, in the domain of speculations, rather than answers. But the human mind abhors a vacuum; we seem to need to relate important new ideas to familiar concepts, and nearly every newcomer to quantum mechanics must engage in the struggle to get rid of classically-based answers to these questions. Our tendency to draw on classical physics as we grope for an understanding of quantum theory is certainly understandable. We're seduced by similarities. For example, the state function plays a role in quantum mechanics that is analogous to that played by the trajectory in classical mechanics: it is the basic mathematical element, the state descriptor, of the theory. But the identification must end with this analogue! A wave function is not a trajectory. My point, which you'll hear me rant about again, is that at both the conceptual and the mathematical level, quantum mechanics is not just a funny- looking reformulation of classical physics. The two physical theories are fundamentally, physically different. Sec. 3.7 Final Thoughts 85 Even words lead us astray. When thinking about a \"wave function,\" we naturally tend to envision a wave in the classical sense: an actual, extant, three-dimensional waveform that propagates and carries energy. To be sure, we know from Chap. 2 that to picture a microscopic particle as a wave is wrong. But what of the \"wave functions\" that represent states of these particles? They seem rather like classical waves, don't they? They do-but they aren't. Although the properties and behavior of quantum waves are familiar, these waves are totally unlike any you have ever studied. For example, unlike classical waves, quantum waves don't carry energy. So it's impossible to detect wave functions per se; these bizarre entities manifest themselves only indirectly, through their influence on the behavior of quantum particles as they propagate through space. (This feature led Einstein to refer to quantum waves as \"ghost waves:') The foundation of your thinking about wave functions should be not the classical concept of a wave but rather the novel notion that state functions carry information-probabilistic and statistical information about how the particles whose states they represent would behave were their properties measured. Moreover, wave functions do not exist in space, at least not in the sense that classical waves exist. Consider space. The space in which we walk around, frolic, study quantum mechanics, and perform experiments is called 3P; we specify locations in ~ by the values of three real numbers in an orthogonal coordinate system. Now consider a state function. Such a function is complex and so could not exist in ~ , for only real numbers and functions exist in this space. Moreover, the state function for a many-particle system depends on several coordinates. How could a function such as \\11(rl' r2, t) exist in geometrical space? It's nonsense to suggest that such a function exists, as does an electromagnetic wave, in a space of three spatial coordinates. The moral of these ruminations is that whatever \\11 is, it's not a conventional undulation in space, like an electric field. So where does this leave us in our quest to understand the reality behind the state function? Do wave functions really exist? Here .is Werner Heisenberg trying to answer this question: The probability wave . .. [stands] in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality. [emphasis mine] Heisenberg's answer is strange indeed, for it leaves us in a kind of metaphysical limbo without an experimental escape route. When we're not looking at microscopic particles, they behave in ways that correspond to the classical wave model; yet, when we measure their properties, they behave like classical particles. The postulates of this chapter provide a way out of this logical conundrum: we assume that complex functions exist that are somehow associated with the states of a microscopic system. These functions carry probabilistic information about the outcomes of measurements of the observables of the system. Finally, they can interfere according to the Principle of Superposition-and therein lies the explanation of the observed behavior of quantum particles. As far as anyone knows, the behavior of all microscopic particles is governed by probability waves; every electron, proton, and neutron in every atom in every blob of matter in the universe (including your author) is guided by its state function. As Nick Herbert says in his Quantum Reality (Doubleday/Anchor Press, 1985): In each atom . . . something seems smeared out to fill the atom, an indescribable something we call the \"probability cloud,\" \"realm of positional possibilities,\" \"electron 86 Chap. 3 First Postulates wave function,\" or \"quantumstuff\" without really being very sure what we're talking about. Whatever it is, though, the whole world is made of it. In our next chapter, we'll take a close look at the \"quantumstuff' of the simplest imag- inable system: one particle in one dimension doing nothing. ANNOTATED SELECTED READINGS Basic Tools If you've read this far, surely you know that you're going to need a good math- ematical handbook and a very good table of integrals. You need not, however, spend thousands of dollars on these basic tools. For essential mathematical data at a reasonable price, I recommend 1. Fischbeck, H. J., and K. H. Fischbeck, Formulas, Facts. and Constants for Students and Professionals (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1982) (available in paperback). 2. Dwight, Herbert 8., Tables of Integrals and Other Mathematical Data , 4th ed. (New York: Macmillan, 1961). This book also contains a very good set of integral tables. If you are willing to spend a little more-for a volume that you will use through- out your professional career-I can oblige. For my money, the ultimate mathematical handbook is 3. Korn, G. A., and T. M. Korn, Mathematical Handbookfor Scientists and Engineers , 2nd ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1968). And the ultimate integral table is the truly awesome compendium 4. Gradshteyn, I. S., and I. M. Ryzhik, Table of Integrals. Series, and Products, Corrected and Enlarged Edition (New York: Academic Press, 1980). Complex Variables Complex numbers and functions are an essential part of the language of quantum physics. As we have seen, the basic element of this theory is a complex function. Actually, you won't need a sophisticated knowledge of these topics to cope with this book. (For example, neither residues nor complex integration appear herein.) And Appendix K contains a very brief survey for the initiated. For others, I recommend the sections on complex variables in the following texts (listed here in order of increasing complexity): 5.

(New York: Academic Press, 1970), Chap. 6, especially Â§ 6.1. 7. Cushing, James T., Applied Analytical Mathematics for Physical Scientists (New York: Wi- ley, 1975), Chap. 7. And for the enthusiast, I recommend the following books that are devoted exclusively to complex variables: 8. Kyrala, A., Applied Functions ofa Complex Variable (New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1972). This book contains a particularly valuable set of worked examples . 9. Churchill , Ruel V., Complex Variables and Applications, 2nd ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1960). Annotated Selected Readings 87 Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics The endlessly provocative question of the meaning of the state function, which I lighted on briefly in Â§ 3.7, has been argued in a rather intimidating number of works- some of them highly controversial. In addition to the popular-level books recommended in Chap. 2, I strongly advise the curious reader to dig up a copy of these items: 10. Jammer, Max, The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: The Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics in Historical Perspective (New York: Wiley, 1974). This fascinating and largely readable book is a clear survey of the controversy surrounding the meaning of the state function. 11. Belinfante, F. 1., Measurement and Time Reversal in Objective Quantum Theory (New York: Pergamon, 1975). Nowhere near as intimidating as its title, this little volume-which is available in softcover at a reasonable price-c-contains a particularly useful analysis of the probability interpretation (Â§ 1) and a section provocatively entitled \"Quantum Mechanics and God.\" 12. DeWitt, Bryce S., and R. Neill Graham, eds., The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1973). Much of this (paperback) book consists of reprints of classic papers on this, the principle alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation. Many of these may be beyond most readers of this book. But at least Bryce DeWitt's \"Quantum Mechanics and Reality\" should be accessible to you, and the whole volume is a worthwhile and fairly inexpensive addition to your library. Among the plethora of papers on the interpretation of quantum physics, I particu- larly want to encourage you to peruse the following: 13. Epstein, Paul S., \"The Reality Problem in Quantum Mechanics\" Amer. Jour . Phys. 13, 127 (1945). 14. Lande, Alfred, \"Quantum Fact and Fiction\" Amer. Jour. Phys. 33, 123 (1965). 15. Shimony, Abner, \" Role of the Observer in Quantum Theory\" Amer. Jour . Phys. 31, 755 (1963). Max Born has written several fascinating and lucid books on quantum theory and its interpretation. Especially recommended are 16. Causality and Chance in Modern Physics (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1957), and Born's autobiographical reflections 17. My Life and Views (New York: Scribners, 1958). Born and Einstein argued at fascinating length over these matters, and you can find their correspondence in 18. The Born-Einstein Letters (New York: Walker and Company, 1971). Finally, an invaluable guide to further reading on this subject is 19. DeWitt, Bryce S., and R. Neill Graham, \"Resource Letter IQM-I on the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\" Amer. Jour . Phys. 39,724 (1971). Alternative Postulations One's choice of the postulates upon which one erects quantum mechanics is, to some extent, flexible. The graduate (and many of the undergraduate) texts in the Bibli- ography at the end of this book illustrate this point, but you may want to consider one of the following books. Both adopt a more formal approach to quantum theory than mine but write at the same level. And both are filled with valuable insights: 20.

Problems 3.1 Fun with Probabilities (a) Preparing for a Thanksgiving trip to Las Vegas, an enterprising student decides to study the likelihood of his becoming fantastically wealthy playing dice. Let s denote the number of spots shown by a (six-sided) die thrown at random. (Assume the unlikely idealization of an honest casino-no loaded dice.) (I) Calculate the average result of an ensemble measurement of s, (2) Calculate the standard deviation of the results of this study. (b) A zoology graduate student has conned his thesis advisor into letting him do a dissertation on the distribution of hairs in a rare species of gnu. Prior to leaving for gnu country in the Kalahari, he finds in the library an earlier research study on this fascinating topic that found that the number of hairs on this species can only be the integer Ne = 2e, where t is any non-negative integer. Moreover, the probability of finding an animal with Ne hairs has been found to be e- 1I(t !). Worried that this might be bad gnus, he investigates further: (1) Evaluate and interpret the ensemble average (N) . (2) Evaluate and interpret the standard deviation, !IN . 3.2 Exploring the States of a Simple Quantum System In this problem, we'll try to gain familiarity with several important new quantities introduced in Chap. 3 by considering three states of an extremely simple system: the particle in an infinite square well. This system consists of a particle of mass m in one dimension with potential 1 x < --L - 2 1 1 --L < z < -L ' 2 2 ' 1 x~ 2L. Here are three physically admissible state functions for this system (which we'll derive in Chap. 7): Wl(X,t) = N1cos(1l\"Z) e-iElt/1i W2(X , t) = N2sin (21l\"Z) e-iE2t/1i w(x ,t) = N[cos(1l\"Z) e-iElt/li+sin(21l\"Z)e-iE2t/,']. ground state first excited state another state All state functions are zero outside the box. In these expressions, N1 , N2 , and N are normalization constants, and E 1 and E2 are the energies of the ground and first excited states, respectively. As we'll discover in Chap. 7, these energies are given by Exercises and Problems 91 for n = 1,2, . .. . 2 7f'21i2 En = n 2mL2 Notice that the third state, the one represented by w(x, t), is a superposition of those repre- sented by the other two wave functions. (a) Normalize each of these state functions. (b) For each of these three wave functions, answer the following questions concerning the results of an ensemble measurement of position that is performed at some time t > 0: (I) What average value of x will be obtained? (If your answer is time-dependent, write the time dependence as a real function of time.) (2) Is your answer to (bI) equal to the most probable position for WI and W2? Why or why not? (3) Does your answer to (bl) depend on time? (c) Evaluate the uncertainty in position for the ground and first excited states. (d) Sketch carefully the real part of w(x, t) for two times, t = 0 and t = 2mL2j(37f'1i). Using your sketches, explain the behavior of (x) for this state as time passes (as found in part (b3) above). Plot these functions in terms of f . [Choose a convenient (but reasonable) value for L if you wish.] 3.3 Deducing Information from State Functions without Work: I To actually solve for the state functions of a quantum mechanical system requires a fair bit of mathematical acuity-we must solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (3.39), a task we shall spend most of this book mastering. It is possible, however, to deduce lots of important physical information from such state functions without solving complicated equations provided you understand the meaning of the quantum mechanical quantities involved. In this problem (and the next) we shall do this for a couple of simple and important systems. In Fig. 3.3.1 you'll find a graph of wave functions for four quantum states of a particle of mass m in one dimension with a simple harmonic oscillator potential energy 1 2 2 V(x) = '2mwox , (3.3.1) where Wo is the natural frequency of the oscillator. These special stationary states have several unusual properties; they are the subject of Chap. 7. Of immediate relevance is that the energyofa stationary state has a well-defined value. That is,for a stationarystate ~E(t) = 0 for all times t. 'It(x.O) n=O x 'It(x, 0) x 'It(x, 0) n =2 'It(x,O) x Figure 3.3.1 Snapshots of the first four stationary states of a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator at t = O. We'll denote the stationary-state wave functions of the one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator by Wn(x, t), where n is an index that tells us the energy of the state: n = 0 is the ground state (the state of minimum energy), n = 1 the first excited state, and so forth. The energies of these states are 92 Chap . 3 First Postulates (3.3.2)for n = 0, 1,2 , . . .E\" = (n +~) liwo. (a) Sketch the probability densities P\"(x , 0) for the four stationary states whose wave func- tions are shown in Fig. 3.3.1.

(b) By extrapolating from the shapes of the wave functions in Fig. 3.3.1, sketch the wave function for W4(X,0) and the corresponding probability density P4(x,0). (c) What is the mean value of position (x)n (at time t = 0) for these four stationary states? Think, don't calculate. Support your answer with an argument using words and pictures, but no equations . (d) The state functions for the first two of the states shown in Fig. 3.3.1 can be conveniently expressed in terms of the constant {3 2 = rnwo - Ii . (3.3.3) They are (3.3.4b) (3.3.4a)( {311'2 ) 1/4 e-f32x2/2 Wo(x,O) = Wl(X,O) = (~)1/4 .)2({3x)e-f32x2/2. Using the definition of the ensemble average of position, support your answer to part (c) by graphing the integrands of (x)o and (X)I' (e) What mathematical property of the state functions w,,(x,O) , explains your answer to part (c)? Assume that this property holds for all stationary state wave functions of the simple harmonic oscillator potential (we'll verify this assumption in Chap. 8). Now, guess the mean value of position (x) n for any stationary state of this system. 3.4 More Deductions from Simple Wave Functions A particularly simple collection of wave functions are those for a particle in an infinite square well. Let's consider the first four of these functions, Wn (x, 0) for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. Assume that the width of the potential well is L. Like the states of the simple harmonic oscillator in the previous problem, these states are stationary, with (well-defined) energies . For the infinite square well, these energies are for n = 1,2,3, . .. (3.4 .1) (3.4.3) (3.4 .2) In Chap. 7 we'll derive the explicit mathematical forms for the stationary-state wave functions. For the first two, we'll find Wl(X,t) = VIcos (11'1) e-iEtt/h W2(X,t) = VIsin (211'1) e-iE2t/h (a) By thinking about the symmetry of the infinite square well and the above expressions for Wl(X,O) and W2(X, 0), guess the mathematical form of W3(X, 0). (You need not worry about the normalization constant N3 , although you probably can guess this too.) (b) Sketch Ws (x ,0) and the corresponding probability density .

Hint: Try graphing the integrands of (X)1 and (X)2' Exercises and Problems 93 (d) Notice that the stationary-state wave functions alternate parity with increasing n-i .e., the ground state (n = 1) is an even function of z, the first excited state (n = 2) is an odd function of z, the second excited state (n = 3) is even, and so forth. Does this property of wn(x,t) have any effect on the expectation value (x)n? Does it have any effect on the position uncertainty (.6.X)n for these states? Explain why or why not. (e) Do you expect (.6.X)n to be independent of n? Justify your answer, preferably with sketches. (f) For a stationary state wn(x, t), do the expectation value (x)n and the uncertainty (.6.X)n depend on time? Justify your answer. 3.5 The Classical Limit is Not Necessarily Macroscopic Many students of quantum mechanics fall into the seductive trap of thinking that the only limit in which classical mechanics pertains to a system is that in which the size of the particle(s) in the system is large-the macroscopic limit. This is not always the case. In this problem, we shall begin to explore this point using the infinite square well discussed in several prior problems and our understanding of the basic quantum principles. (Note: You need not have worked the earlier problems on the infinite square weIl to solve this one, but you may need to use some of the results included in the statements of those problems.) (a) The wave function for the ground state of the infinite square weIl at t = 0 is (3.5.1) This is the first of an infinite number of special states of this system , called stationary states, for which .6.E = O. Evaluate the position uncertainty (.6.xh for this state at t =0. (b) Sketch the probability density Iwn(x, oW for a stationary state with a very large energy; i.e., for n ~ 1. (c) Evaluate the position uncertainty (.6.X)n for n ~ 1. (Express your answer in terms of L.) Hint : Your sketch in (b) should suggest a nifty approximation that will greatly simplify the integral you need to evaluate in (c). (d) Compare your answer to (c) with the classical standard deviation of position-i.e., the value you would get for a macroscopic particle in an infinite square weIl of macroscopic width L . Do your answers to parts (b}-(d) depend on the mass m of the particle? What can you conclude from this problem about the classical limit of quantum mechanics? 3.6 Exposing the Non-Classical Behavior of a Quantum Particle In Fig. 3.6.1 is shown the ground-state wave function Wl(X,O) for a particle of mass m in a finite potential well of strength Vo. The particle in this state has a well-defined energy E < G-i.e ., the energy in this state is certain and (.6.Eh = o. If you look carefully at WI (x, 0), you will note that the position probability amplitude for this state is non-zero in the classically-forbidden regions x > L/2 and x < -L/2. In such a region, E < V, so T = E - V < 0: a \"classically-forbidden\" situation. In Chap . 8 we'll solve for these wave functions and will see why they are non-zero in classically-forbidden regions. In this problem, we shall explore some ramifications of this fact from the vantage point of the key ideas of quantum physics. Suppose we set out to detect experimentally particles in a classically-forbidden region . How might we do this? We could use a photon microscope, scattering photons from the particle . Of course, we must be sure that the particle from which the photon scatters is actually in a classically-forbidden region, i.e., that is not at some x < L/2 or x> -L/2. For simplicity, let's concentrate in this problem on the right-hand classically forbidden region, x> L/2. 94 Chap. 3 First Postulates V(x) â€¢ I I ,....-- (Â£=01 ------ Â£1 (bl Figure 3.6.1 (a). A finite square well potential energy. In this problem we consider the ground-state of a particle of mass m with this potential energy. (b). The wave function at t = 0 for this state. x o------'-- .....------- (-Vo) x First we need to define this region more precisely. Looking at Fig. 3.6.1, we notice that the wave function decays exponentially in the classically-forbidden region. In fact, as we'll learn in Chap. 8, the form of the wave function in this region is I{I(X!-O)! = sÂ«>, e > LJ2 (3.6.1) where the constant K, is defined as K, == kV2m (-E). (3.6.2) To avoid having to worry about the minus sign on the energy, which results from our choice of the top of the well in Fig. 3.6.1 as the zero of energy, we'll introduce the binding energy e, which is defined as e== -E, (3.6.3) whence K, can be written (3.6.4)K, = kV2me . Now, taking a clue from optics, let's define the classically forbidden region as [L/2, xo], where Xo is defined as the position where the probability density is 1/e of its maximum value in this region, P(Xo,O) = ~p(~,O) . (3.6.5) (The total internal reflection of light at a glass-to-air interface behaves in a fashion analogous to the probability density in this problem.) (a) To guarantee that we detect particles that are in the classical-forbidden region, we require that the position uncertainty be no greater than the size of this region, i.e., ~X ~ zo - ~. (3.6.6) Exercises and Problems 95 What is the resulting uncertainty in the (x component of) momentum p of the particle? (b) If p is uncertain, then we cannot know the precise value of the kinetic energy K of the particle. What is the uncertainty I:i.K in this quantity? (c) Now, suppose we find a particle in the classically-forbidden region. Can we know that its kinetic energy is negative? Explain how the uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality conspire in this measurement to resolve the apparent paradox of a negative kinetic energy particle. (d) Two students, pondering the state function shown in Fig. 3.6.1, comment as fol1ows: Student A: \"A quantum particle in the c1assical1y-forbidden region has a negative kinetic energy,\" Student B: \"There is a finite probability of detecting the particle in the c1assical1y- forbidden region,\" Is either of these statements correct? If not, discuss the logical error in the thinking of the student(s) who is (are) wrong. Hint : What condition must we place on the intensity of the photon beam used to illuminate the c1assical1y-forbidden region if we are to detect an electron inside this region? Thinking about this question should lead you to an upper limit on the wavelength of the photon we can use in this experiment and hence to a conclusion very much like that of part [c). 96 Chap. 3 First Postulates CHAPTER 4 An Illustrative Interlude Wave Packets in One Dimension 4.1 On the Nature of the Free-Particle State Function 4.2 Wave Packet Construction for Fun and Profit 4.3 The Amplitude Function * 4 .4 Fourier Analysis (A Mathematical Detour) 4.5 An Extended Example: The Gaussian Wave Packet Unmasked 4.6 Uncertainty Regained 4.7 (Not Quite) All About Momentum 4.8 Final Thoughts: A Wealth of Representations I dare say that's an idea which has already occurred to you, but with the weight of my great mind behind it, no doubt it strikes the imagination more forcibly. -Lord Peter Wimsey in Strong Poison by Dorothy L. Sayers Postulates I and II are the first bricks in the foundation of quantum mechanics. The first postulate identifies the basic element of the theory: the wave function. The second postulate interprets this function as a position probability amplitude. As befits the intro- duction, the discussion in Chap. 3 was general and rather abstract. So in this chapter, we'll take a breather from this development to explore at length a single, simple example : a microscopic free particle in one dimension. The physics of this system is especially simple because, as its name implies, such a particle is free of external forces or fields.1 Aside: Free Particles in the Real World. A free particle is, of course, an idealiza- tion; no system is truly isolated from external influences. Nevertheless, the example of this chapter finds wide application in quantum physics. The reason is that in many situations, the external forces that do act on a particle are so weak that we can ne- glect them. For example, in electron scattering experiments physicists use a beam of non-interacting electrons. Such a beam is, of course, subject to the force of gravity. But we need not take this force into account in a description of its physics, because the effect of this very weak force on the particles in the beam is negligible. Our objective in this chapter is the wave function \\11(x ,t) of a free particle in one dimension. Ordinarily, we would obtain this function by mathematical machinations- we'd solve the time-dependent SchrOdinger Equation [Eq. (3.39)], [ 1i2 (}2] a - 2m ax2 + V(x) \\11(x ,t) = iii at \\11(x, t). (4.1) Since a free particle experiences no external forces, its potential energy is a constant the value of which I'll set equal to zero:2 V(x) = 0 [for a free particle]. (4.2) So the Schrodinger Equation for a free particle is just (4.1) without the term in V(x) . At this stage in our study, I want to avoid the algebraic chore of solving this second- order partial differential equation--even for so simple a system as the free particle. Instead, I want to lead you to a deeper understanding of the nature of wave functions . So our strategy (in Â§ 4.1 and 4.2) will be to deduce rather than derive the state function for a free particle. What we will find is that this function must be a complex wave packet. Wave packets play an important role in quantum mechanics, so we'll spend a little time (in 1A classical analogue of a free particle in one dimension is a macroscopic bead constrained to move along a (hypothetical) infinite, frictionless wire. 2Recall that the potential energy of a system is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since only potential differences are measurable. See Chap. 8 of Fundamentals of Physics, 2nd ed., by D. Halliday and R. Resnick (New York: Wiley, 1981). 98 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude Â§ 4.2-4.4) examining the mathematics of their construction via Fourier analysis. But, as always, physics remains paramount, and in Â§ 4.5 we'll discover uncertainty in the representation of a state by a wave packet. Finally, in Â§ 4.6-4.7, we'll see a tantalizing glimpse of how to extract information about observables other than position from a wave function. This analysis will hurtle us into Chap. 5, where we tackle momentum. 4.1 ON THE NATURE OF THE FREE-PARTICLE STATE FUNCTION Always trust the simplest explanation that fits all the facts unless there's a damn good reason not to do so. - Dr. Stuart Hay in Incarnate by Ramsey Campbell What do we know about state functions? In particular, what properties should character- ize the state functions of a particle in one dimension? Well, in Â§ 3.5 I argued that such a function must be single -valued, continuous, and-most importantly-normalizable. That is, it must obey the boundary condition (3.29), according to which \\II(x, t) must go to zero (as Ixl -+ 00) rapidly enough that its normalization integral J~oo \\II. (x, t)\\II(x, t) dx is finite. Physically, this condition means that the wave function must be spatially localized. That's one property. Another is evident from the Schrodinger Equation (4.1): \\II(x, t) must be complex. Here's why: the right-hand side of this equation has a multiplicative factor of i = A that is absent from the left-hand side. Therefore no purely real or purely imaginary function can satisfy this equation . Were \\II(x, t) purely real, for example, then the left- hand side would be real and the right-hand side would be imaginary-which would violate the equal signl ' These two properties pertain to the state functions of any system. When we turn to the free particle (or any other isolated system) we find a third, quite different property: a fundamental symmetry of nature called the homogeneity offree space. I want to tell you about this property , which is the topic of the next subsection, to introduce you to the power and beauty of symmetry arguments. From this symmetry property of space itself, we'll derive a condition on the probability density P = 1\\111 2 that all free-particle state functions must satisfy. Then we'll use this property-and a little imagination and logic-to deduce the wave function for the free particle in one dimension. The Homogeneity of Free Space What's the first step we must take if we want to investigate the physics of a system, be it microscopic or macroscopic? We must define a reference frame. The one you're probably most familiar with is the rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinate system shown in 3This argument does not imply that 'I1(x, t) must be complex at all times; it can be real (or imaginary) at certain. discrete times. But it does imply that the wave function cannot be purely real or imaginary at all times. Sec. 4.1 On the Nature of the Free-Particle State Function 99 Fig. 4.1. The directions of the three mutually orthogonal axes that define this reference frame are ex, ey , and ez â€¢4 These axes intersect at the origin O. Figure 4.1 A Cartesian coordinate system. Within this system several sets of orthogonal coordinates can be used, among them rectangular and spherical coordinates. The decision of where to put the origin of coordinates is very important, because all vectors are referred to this point. But the choice of origin is ours to make. After all, coordinates and reference frames are just mathematical artifices that physicists invent to solve problems. A Historical Aside. This feature of theoretical physics was noted in 1885 in an essay by Charles Howard Hinton (1853-1907): To measure, we must begin somewhere, but in space there is no \"somewhere\" marked out for us to begin at. This measuring is some- thing, after all, foreign to space, introduced by us for our convenience. And as to dimensions, in order to enumerate and realize the dif- ferent dimensions, we must fix on a particular line to begin with, and then draw other lines at right angles to this one. But the first straight line we take can be drawn in an infinite number of directions. Why should we take any particular one? If we take any particular line, we do something arbitrary, of our own will and decision, not given to us naturally by space. Hinton's comments lead us to expect physically measurable properties to be indepen- dent of such arbitrary choices. And, indeed, they are.\" In practice we have several ways to pick the origin of coordinates. We might choose an origin that will simplify the solution of whatever equations we confront. Or we might select as the origin the location of a measuring apparatus. But most often we look to nature for guidance. For example, we might identify some physical entity-say, a (point) particle in the system or the source of an electromagnetic field-as the origin. But if the particle is free, then we cannot use the latter gambit, for nothing in free space distinguishes one point over another. That is, nature does not identify a preferred origin for a free particle. In this case we can put 0 anywhere we wish. 4Little hats do a lot of work in quantum mechanics. Throughout this book, a little hat on an e, such as ei. will denote a unit vector in the i direction. (For rectangularcoordinates. i = x, y, z.) But from Chap. 5 onward, little hats on other symbols will denote operators. Be wary. 5 Hinton was so interesting a character that I can't resist telling you a little about him. Many consider him one of the great philosophers of hyperspace: he was fascinated by the fourth dimension. No, fascinated is the wrong word; Hinton was obsessed. In an effort to constructa mental imageof a four-dimensional universe, he memorized 46,656 one-inchcubes. each of which had been assigneda Latin name. Evidently, this daunting task was not challenging enough for Hinton, who next decided to learn his cubic yard of cubes in each of its twenty-four possible orientations. For more on this eccentric but brilliant mathematician, see Rudy Rucker's delightful book. The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1984). 100 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude This discussion of the origin of coordinates leads us to the fundamental symmetry property I mentioned above: the homogeneity of free space. When we say \"free space is homogeneous\" we mean that the physical properties of a system in free space are independent ofthe origin ofcoordinates. The implications of homogeneity for a physical theory (such as quantum mechanics) are strict indeed: Rule All physical quantities we calculate must be independent of the origin of coordinates. You can see what this means if you imagine picking up the system and translating it through space to a new location. According to this rule, all measurable quantities that you calculate from a state descriptor of the system after translation must equal those calculated from the corresponding state descriptor before translation. Since in quantum mechanics we calculate properties from wave functions, it should come as no surprise that the homogeneity requirement imposes a limitation on wave functions. But be careful-the nature of this limitation is rather subtle. Homogeneity does not imply that the state function itself must be independent of the coordinate origin, because this function is not measurable. But all measurable quantities are calculated from the probability density 1ItÂ·1It, so the homogeneity of free space demands that the probability density be independent of the origin of coordinates. That is, a translation of a microscopic free particle must not alter its probability density. Such a translation appears in Fig. 4.2. PI x. t) x x+a x Figure 4.2 The effect on the probability density of the translation of a microscopic system by a distance a in the +x direction. The state function of the system is changed by the translation and so depends on a. But the probability density must be unchanged; i.e., it must be independent of a. To use this property to deduce the free-particle state function, we'll need a mathe- matical expression of it. So let's consider translating a system that before translation is in a quantum state represented by lit. The state function after translation will, in general, be some other function of position and time. (We'll assume instantaneous translation, so t does not change.) This function will also depend on the translation distance a. So I'll represent the state after translation by 1It~. Now, the relationship between the state functions of a one-dimensional system before and after translation in the x direction is simply 1It~(x,t) = lIt(x - a, t) [for translation by a in the +x direction]. (4.3) With this notation we can easily write down the homogeneity requirement that the prob- ability densities before and after translation be equal, viz., Sec. 4.1 On the Nature of the Free-Particle State Function 101 I homogeneity of free space (4.4) We are now ready to tackle the problem of the free particle. But before we begin, let's summarize the properties that the state function of such a particle must obey: 1. \\II must be spatially localized (normaIizable); 2. \\II must be a complex function of position and time; 3. \\II must not violate the homogeneity of free space. Homogeneity and the Free-Particle State Function To show you how to use the homogeneity requirement (4.4) to check out prospective free-particle state functions, I'll try one that we know is wrong. Consider a free particle in a state with momentum p and energy E. 6 According to the de Broglie relations (2.16), the wave characteristics of particles in such a state are the associated wavelength A = hlp and frequency v = Elh, where h is Planck's constant. These relations suggest a guess at the wave function of the particle: a real harmonic wave with this wavelength and frequency: f(x , t) = A cos e;x - 21fvt + a) . real harmonic wave (4.5) (4.60) (4.6b)angular frequency wave number In this generic harmonic wave , the amplitude A and phase constant a are real numbers that, in practice, are determined from the initial conditions on the problem.\" In this section we are concerned only with the functional form of f(x ,t), so for convenience I'll set a = O. Before proceeding to shoot down this guess, I want to get rid of the unsightly factors of 21f littering Eq. (4.5) . Harmonic waves are usually written in terms of the wave number k and angular frequency w, which are defined by k = 211\" - A w=211\"v The de Broglie relations specify the connection between these fellows and the momentum p and energy E of the state: p = hk E = hw, (4.7a) (4.7b) where I've introduced the all-purpose 211\"-absorber (otherwise known as the \"rationalized Planck's constant\") 61n nature, free-particle states in which energy and momentum can be known precisely don't exist. Statistically speaking, we say that the uncertainties in the energy and momentum are positive for all states: tiE > 0 and tip > O. But states do exist in which the energy and momentum are very nearly certain (i .e., these uncertainties are very small), and we often approximate such a state by a function with a well-defined E and p. 7The initial conditions on !( x , t ) are just its values at a particular position and time, usually at x = 0 and t = O. We can choose the phase constant a to force the general form (4.5) to agree with any initial conditions. If, for example, !(O,O) = A , we choose a = O. If, on the other hand, !(O,O) = 0, we choose a = 311'/2. The latter often-used choice, by the way, transforms the cosine function into a sine function, so that the function becomes !(x, t) = A sin(kx - wt) . And so forth. 102 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude (4.8) In its new clothes, our guess (4.5) for a free-particle state function looks like W(x, t) = A cos(kx - wt). (4.9) This function is sketched in Fig. 4.3. 'ltlx.O) x la) (b) Figure 4.3 (a) The real harmonic wave of Eq. (4.9) at t = O. and (b) its square. This function oscillates throughout space. as suggested by the dotted lines at the fringes of these curves. Consequently it cannot be normalized and is not physically admissible. (4.lOa)[for a non-relativistic free particle] Aside: The Dispersion Relation. Youprobably remember from your study of waves that the angular frequency w and the wave number k are related via a dispersion relation. In quantum mechanics, we can determine the dispersion relation from the relationship between the total energy and the momentum. For example. the energy of a free particle is purely kinetic. so provided its velocity is non-relativistic (v Â« c). the total energy E is related to the linear momentum p by the simple formula E=L. 2m Translating this into a dispersion relation via the definitions (4.7). we get\" hk2 w(k) = 2m ' dispersion relation for a free particle (4.lOb) Now we all know why Eq. (4.9) won't do. First, we can see from Fig. 4.3 that for this guess the normalization integral-the area under the probability density curve-is infinite, so this function can't be normalized. Moreover, it's not complex and so couldn't 8If the particle is traveling at relativistic velocities. the total energy (including the rest-mass energy) and the linear momentum are related by Eq. (2.14). so (4.lOb) is not applicable. For such a particle of rest mass mo. the dispersion relation is Sec. 4.1 On the Nature of the Free-Particle State Function 103 satisfy the Schrodinger equation (4.1). But I want to show you yet another reason it won't work: it violates the homogeneity requirement. Example 4.1. The Real Harmonic Wave and the Homogeneity Requirement The demonstration is easy: we just determine the probability densities of the state (4.9) before and after translation and see if they're the same. Before translation , the probability is just the squared modulus of the function (4.9), P(x, t} = A 2 cos 2(kx - wt}. After translation, the wave function is given [a ta Eq. (4.3)] by w~(x,t} = A cos[k(x - a} - wt], which we can expand (using the handy trig identities in Appendix H) into w~(x,t} = A [cos(kx - wt} coska + sin(kx - wt} sinkaJ. So the probability density after translation is (4.11) (4.12a) (4.12b) w~'(x,t} w~(x,t} = A 2 cos 2(kx - wt} cos 2 ka + A 2 [sin2(kx - wt}sin 2 ka+ 2 cos kasin kacos(kx - wt}sin(kx - wt}] . (4.13) Now look carefully at the first term in (4.13). Compare it to (4.11). See? The first of the three terms in the probability density after translation is P(x, t} cos2 ka, the product of the probability density beforetranslation and an additional factor! This result proves that a real harmonic wave, in addition to its other faults, violates the homogeneity requirement: P~(x, t) ;;j; P (x , t}. [for a real harmonic wave]. (4.14) This (act alone is enough to invalidate this function as a state descriptor for a free particle, for it is inconsistent with a fundamental symmetry property of nature itself. Back to the drawing board. Question 4-1 As you probably know, any real function can be decomposed into a series of sine and cosine functions. Using this fact, present a brief argument that no real function of x and t can satisfy the homogeneity requirement. Question 4-2 Show that the linear combination of plane harmonic waves w(x, t) = cos(kx - wt} + i sin(kx - wt} does satisfy the homogeneity requirement . A second Guess: The Complex Harmonic Wave (4.15) Of the three defects of the real harmonic wave, the easiest to repair is its real character. . A simple complex function that we might nominate as a candidate for the representative of a free-particle state with well-defined energy and momentum is the generalization suggested by Question 4--2: a complex harmonic wave of the form 104 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude w(x, t) = A ei(kx-wt), complex harmonicwave (4.16) (4.170) (4.17b) (4.l7c) = e- ika [Aeik (X- wt)] = e- ika w(x , t) . where, as in the real harmonic wave, the frequency and wave number are related by the free-particle dispersion relation\" w(k) = hk2/2m. Now let's see if this guess satisfies the demanding homogeneity requirement. Example 4.2. The Complex Harmonic Wave and the Homogeneity Requirement The state function (4.16) after translation is w~ (x,t) = A ei(kx-ka-wt ) I hope you're way ahead of me by now. According to (4.l7c), the state function after translation is identical to that before translation except for the multiplicative factor e-ika. So the state function depends on the origin of coordinates only through this exponential factor. [Notice that since ka is a constant, this is just a global phase factor (Â§ 3.5).] When we form the probability density after translation, this factor obligingly goes away: w~*(x, t)w~(x , t) = eikaw*(x , t) e- ikaw(x, t) =w*(x, t) w(x, t) . (4.180) (4.18b) So the probability density formed from a complex harmonic wave is unchanged by a trans- lation. We conclude that such a wave does satisfy the homogeneity requirement (4.4). It also satisfies another of our properties: it's complex. That's two out of three. Now, what's wrong with it? Question 4-3 Verify that the complex harmonic wave (4.16) satisfies the time dependent Schrodinger Equation (4.1) for the free particle. On the Horns of a Dilemma Alas, the simple complex harmonic wave (4.16) is not spatially localized. This regrettable property is obvious from its probability density, which is constant : P(x ,t) = w*(x, t)W(x, t) = IAI2 â€¢ [for a complex harmonic wave]. (4.19) A constant probability density implies that we're equally likely to detect an electron anywhere in space. That is, the complex harmonic wave would represent a state in which we know nothing about the position of the particle; this observable is \"infinitely 9Eq. (4.16) is the general form of a complex traveling wave that propagates in the +x direction. The corresponding form for a wave propagating in the -x direction is lI'(x , t) = A e- i(kx+wt ). You may be familiar with such waves from your study of electricity and magnetism, where they are used to represent electric and magnetic fields. It is important to remember, however, that complex electromagnetic waves are just problem-solving tools; we ultimately must take the real parts of such functions, because only real electromagnetic waves exist in the laboratory. For more on complex functions in electromagnetic theory, see Chap. 8 of Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths (Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice Hall. 1981). Sec. 4.1 On the Nature of the Free-Particle State Function 105 indeterminate\" (D-x = 00). So in no sense is a such a state spatially localized. Indeed, it's hard even intuitively to see how we could associate such a wave with a particle. Question 4-4 Is the infinite position uncertainty for the complex harmonic wave consistent with the Heisen- berg Uncertainty Principle? If so, why? If not, why not? The lack of spatial localization shows up in the normalization integral for the complex harmonic wave, which is infinite: i:w*(x, t)W(x,t)dx = IAI2i:dx = 00. [for a complex harmonic wave]. (4.20) We know from Â§ 3.5 that we cannot normalize such a function and hence must reject it as physically inadmissible to quantum physics. Let's review. We argued that the free-particle wave function we seek must satisfy three innocent-looking properties: it must be spatially-localized, complex, and consistent with the homogeneity requirement. Our first guess, the real harmonic wave, violated all of these conditions. Our second, the complex harmonic wave, violated only the requirement of spatial localization. But that's not good enough . Our explorations have not led to the answer-but they have led to valuable clues. The complex harmonic function is so nearly the wave function we seek that it makes sense at this point to try to construct a spatially-localized function by adding together a bunch of these harmonic waves with different wave numbers and frequencies. In the next section, we'll do just that: we're going to build a wave packet. 4.2 WAVE PACKET CONSTRUCTION FOR FUN AND PROFIT Go back to the functions graphed in Fig. 3.1. These are \"snapshots\" of physically admis- sible wave functions (taken at times when they happen to be real). Each wave function is characterized by a single dominant finite region of enhanced position probability-that is the distinctive feature of spatial localization. The probability density for each of these functions defines a \"high probability\" region of space, a realm of possible positions at which the particle is likely to be found. Our goal is to construct such a function. This point of view emphasizes why a single harmonic wave fails: such a wave is monochromatic (i.e., characterized by a single frequency), but regions of enhanced amplitude arise from the interference of harmonic waves with differing wave numbers and frequencies . This fact will be our guiding principle as we set out to build a free- particle wave function. And our tool will be superposition. 10 It's not hard to see how to use superposition to build a wave packet. In a superposi- tion of monochromatic harmonic waves, two kinds of interference happen. Constructive interference occurs at positions where the interfering waves are in phase, leading to an lOin this section, I'll assume that you're familiar with the mathematical and physical properties of waves at roughly the sophomore undergraduate level. If you need a refresher, try one of the Selected Readings at the end of this chapter. 106 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude enhanced amplitude of the total wave. And destructive interference occurs where the interfering waves are out ofphase , leading to a diminished amplitude. We can use these interference phenomena to construct a spatially localized function by forming a linear combination of complex harmonic waves with varying frequencies and amplitudes. Such a linear combination .is called a wave packet. Applying these facts about waves to the task of Â§ 4.1, constructing a function that satisfies the three criteria discussed there, we conclude that what we need is a complex wave packet with a single region of enhanced amplitude: free particle state function = a complex wave packet A Digression: The Pure-Momentum Function (4.21) Before we look at such packets we must get out of the way a mundane but important matter of notation. In spite of their defects, plane harmonic waves such as (4.16) are widely used in quantum mechanics, where they are usually written in terms of momentum and energy, as Wp(x, t) = A ei(px-Et)/fo (4.22) Such a function is called, sensibly, a pure momentum function. Notice that I've appended a subscript p to w(x, t) to remind us what value of momentum we're talking about. Similarly, when discussing the complex harmonic wave written in terms of the wave number k [Eq. (4.16)], I'll sometimes affix to W a subscript k, Aside: The Mathematics of Waves-Phase Velocity, The most important property of a harmonic wave is its propagation velocity, which is called phase velocity. The phase velocity is defined as the velocity of a point of constant phase.'! For a one- dimensional wave the phase velocity is ax IVph = at 'I'=constant phase velocity (4.23) (4.24) For example, the phase velocity of a complex harmonic wave is [see Exercise 4.1] w E Vph = AV = - = - k p So far I have left one thing in the pure momentum function (4.22) unspecified: the amplitude A. We're at liberty to choose this constant to fit the physical conditions of our problem-s-and when we get to collision problems (Chap. 8) we'll take advantage of this flexibility. But there is a conventional choice for A that exploits a nifty property of complex plane waves. If the problem we're solving doesn't suggest a value of A, a good choice for the complex harmonic wave Wk (x, t) is A = 1//'iii, The resulting function llif you are a little bit rusty on the meaning of these quantities please review. You'll find useful information about phase velocities in such sources as Chap. 7 of Yibrations and Waves by A. P. French (New York: Norton, I966) and in Waves by Frank S. Crawford. Jr. (New York: McGraw-Hill. 1968). Sec. 4.2 Wave Packet Construction for Fun and Profit 107 (4.25)w (x t) = _1_ ei {kx- wt)k, .j2rr is, for reasons I'll explain in a moment, called a normalized plane wave. For the pure momentum function w p(x , t), the optimum choice is A = 1/J27rh. The so-called normalized pure momentum function is = _1_ ei {px-Et j/h J27rh (4.26) From here on I'll use these choices of A unless there is a good reason to do otherwise. You'll discover why these choices are desirable as you work with the pure momen- tum function (see especially Â§ 4.7). Here's a preview: they enable us to take advantage of the fact that complex exponentials form a representation of the Dirac Delta function , Vi Z.,12 ~ j oo e- ik' x eikxdx = 8(k _ k'). 27r -00 (4.27) You're probably wondering why I refer to these as \"normalized\" functions, when we know that a complex harmonic wave can't be normalized. This usage is, indeed, inconsistent. Historically, it entered colloquial parlance (at least among mathematicians) because two \"normalized plane waves\" satisfy a kind of \"pseudo-normalization integral,\" I: wZ(x ,O)Wk,(x,O)dx = 8(k - k') . The General Form of a Wave Packet Dirac Deltafunction normalization (4.28) Equation (4.21) gives us our marching orders: to construct a free-particle wave function, we must add together (superpose) complex plane waves with different wave numbers k. Your first thought might be to try a linear combination of a finite number of plane waves with discrete wave numbers kj and amplitudes Aj , such as N w(x, t) = _1_ L Aj ei (kj x- wjt ). .j2rr j = 1 This reasonable suggestion runs aground on a basic property of waves: The superposition of a finite number of plane waves with discrete wave numbers has an infinite number of comparable regions of constructive interference. Each of these regions is separated from its neighbor by a region of destructive interference . This property of wave packets is illustrated in Fig. 4.4 and Problem 4.1. 12you mayor may not have run across the Dirac Della function 6(x) in your studies. Actually, it's not a function at all; it's what mathematicians call afunctional. You can get an idea what 6(x) is by envisioning a \"spike\" that is zero everywhere except the point where its argument is zero, x = O. So in (4.28), 6(k - k' ) is zero everywhere except at at k = k'; where it's infinite. You can find a brief overview of the Dirac Della function and its properties in Appendix L. For more information, I recommend the introductory treatments found on pp. 53-55 of Quantum Physics by R. G. Winter (Belmont, Ca.: Wadsworth. 1979), and in Appendix 2 of Quantum Mechanics, Volume I by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Bernard Diu, and Franck Laloe (New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1977). 108 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude Re[>II,(x.O)) x (al Re[>IIz(x.OI) (bl x Re[>II,(x.O) + >liz (x, on Envelope (el x Figure 4.4 A simple (and unsuitable) wave packet constructed by superposing a mere two plane harmonic waves.

(c) Their superposition, 'I1(x,O) = >III(x,O) + '112(x, 0). The spread of wave numbers for the plane waves in '11(x , 0) is ilk = 211'. (In this figure, only the real parts of the three waves are shown.) But we want a packet with one dominant region of enhanced amplitude-with a single biggest bump. [Additional regions of secondary amplitude (smaller bumps) are okay.] The solution is to use an infinite number of plane waves: Rule To construct a wave packet with a single dominant region of enhanced amplitude we must superpose an infinite number of plane wave functions with infinitesimalIy differing wave numbers. Since k is a continuous variable, our wave packet will have the form of an integral over functions of the form ei(kx-wt). To control the mixture of complex harmonic waves in the superposition, we'll assign each complex plane wave an \"amplitude\" A(k). Using the normalized plane-wave functions (4.25), we write the general form for a wave packet as W(x, t) = _1_1 00 A(k) ei(kx-wt1dk ..j21i - 00 = I:A(k) Wk(X,t) dk wave packet (4.29) Sec. 4.2 Wave Packet Construction for Fun and Profit 109 At present, the amplitude function A(k) is arbitrary; in practice, we define this function to give lJ1(x, t) physical properties that correspond to the quantum state it represents.P Before going any further, I want to emphasize an extremely important point. Equa- tion (4.29) is applicable to many different (one-dimensional) quantum systems; it is not limited to the free particle. In fact, most of the results of this chapter are not limited to the free particle. It is crucial to remember that in constructing wave packets we specify a particular system by our choice of the dispersion relation w = w(k). For the free particle, the appropriate relation is (4.lOb), w(k) = hk 2/2rn. To apply the general form to other systems, we just select the appropriate dispersion relation. Please don't forget this. Aside: The Mathematician's View. A mathematician would probably interpret Eq. (4.29) as an expansion of \\I1(x,t) in a \"complete set\" of plane wave functions \\I1k(X,t), with A(k) the expansion coefficient corresponding to the plane wave with wave number k. [The amplitude function A(k) is also sometimes called the spectral distribution function.] In Chap. 12 we'll discover the (considerable) advantages to adopting this more formal perspective on superpositions of quantum waves. Do you understand how the superposition (4.29) forms a spatially localized func- tion? The key is the phases kx - wt of the constituent plane harmonic waves IJ1k(X,t ). Consider a fixed time-say, t = O. At this time all waves in the packet are in phase at one (and only one) point. This value of x is the the point of total constructive in- terference. At this point the probability density P(x,O) = IIJ1(x, oW attains its global maximum; for this reason , this point is called the center of the wave packet. We usually denote the center of the wave packet by xQ.14 Now, at any other x \"# XQ the plane waves in the packet are out ofphase, so some destructive interference occurs. As we move away from the center of the packet (i.e., as Ix - XQ I increases), this interference becomes more and more destructive, until eventually the amplitude of the state function becomes negligibly small. This is why a wave packet is spatially localized [cf, Eq. (3.29)].15 When we construct a wave packet, we specify the system by the dispersion relation w = w(k). To specify a particular state of this system, we choose the amplitude function A(k). This function determines such properties of the packet as its \"width\"-the spread of values of x encompassed by lJ1(x, 0). Let's see how this works. 13There appears to be an inconsistency between the dimensions of the normalized plane wave (4.25), the normalized pure momentum state function (4.26), and the physically admissible state functions of Chap. 3. In one dimension , the latter must have units of inverse square root of length (l/v'L), because the inte- gral J::' w* (x , t )w (x, t ) dx must be dimensionless [cf, Eq. (3.28a )l. Sure enough, neither Wk(X, t ) nor wp(x , t) has the correct dimensions. But this isn't a problem because these functions appear in wave packets where they are multiplied by amplitude functions that fix the dimensionality of the packet. For example, the units of A(k) in (4.32) are (see Â§ 4.3) v'L. Similarly, in Â§ 4.6 we'll construct a wave function out of pure momentum state functions with an amplitude function cI>(p) that, when multiplied by Wp(x, t), produces a packet with the correct dimensions . 14Be careful not to confuse the center of the wave packet with the average position, (x) (0); for some wave functions; these two points do coincide. But not for all. One other thing: the center of the packet at t = 0 need not be the origin of coordinates ; we can construct a wave packet with its center at XQ Â¥- 0 (see Â§ 4.6). 15The argument I have sketched here is formally known as the stationary phase condition. This condition determines where the point of total constructive interference occurs for a superposition of plane waves. You can find a good introductory discussion of the stationary phase condition in Â§ 2.5 of Introduction to the Quantum Theory, 2nd ed. by David Park (New York: McGraw-Hili, 1974) and more advanced discussions on p. 51 of Quantum Mechanics, Volume I by Alben Messiah (New York: Wiley, 1966) and on p. 19 of Quantum Mechanics , Volume I by Kurt Gottfried (Reading, Mass.: Benjamin/Cumm ings, 1966). 110 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude 4.3 THE AMPLrrUDE FUNCTION The amplitude function A( k) governs the mixture of plane harmonic waves in a particular wave packet; in this sense A(k) distinguishes one wave packet from another. In practice, we usually determine the amplitude function from the value of the state function at t = 0 (Â§ 4.4). But in this section I'll take the amplitude function as given, because I want to show you-by example-how a superposition of an infinite number of complex harmonic waves with a particular amplitude function produces a wave packet with a single dominant region of enhanced position probability. We'll also examine the subtle relationship between the evolution of a wave packet and the motion of a classical particle and will peek into a laboratory where wave packets are used in collision experiments. Figure 4.5 shows two typical amplitude functions. The function in Fig. 4.5a is peaked at k = ko, so the dominant plane wave in the packet formed when we insert this function into the general form (4.29) is Wko(x,t) . Plane wave functions Wk(X,t) with wave numbers far from ko make negligible contributions to the total packet w(x, t) . A(kl (a) k A(k) -'O'k-t-------<~ (bl k Figure 4.5 Two amplitude functions. Each function is characterized by its center leo and width L!l.k. The function in (a) is a Gaussian and will be discussed in Â§ 4.5; the one in (b) is a square step and is used in Example 4.1. In (b). the value of A(kol = 1/...rKk produces a properly normalized amplitude function (see Â§ 4.4). The function in Fig. 4.5b is more equitable: all harmonic waves with wave numbers in the range ko - ! tlk ~ k ~ ko+ 4tlk contribute equally to the resulting wave packet. In Example 4.1 we'll construct a wave packet from this amplitude function. Stay tuned. Aside: On Complex Amplitude Functions. By the way, the sample amplitude functions in Fig. 4.5 are real. But A(k) can be (and often is) complex. If so, we sometimes choose to write it in terms of a magnitude IA(k)1 and a phase a(k), i .e., (4.30) It's important to not lose sight of the physics amidst all the mathematics of wave packet construction. Try to think about these amplitude functions as controllers of the mixture of pure momentum states in the quantum state represented by the wave packet w(x, t). After all, each function Wk(X,t) in such a packet is associated (via the de Broglie relation) with a particular value of the momentum, p = hk. This way of looking at the superposition J~oo A(k)Wk(X, t) dx reveals that the momentum of a quantum state represented by a wave packet is uncertain, i.e., tlp > O. [for a wave packet]. (4.31) This connection between the amplitude function A(k) and the momentum uncertainty tlp is no accident, and we'll return to it in Â§ 4.6 and 4.7. Sec. 4.3 The Amplitude Function 111 (4.33b) (4.33a) Question 4-5 What amplitude function A(k) would produce a packet with a well-defined momentum (i.e., with ti.p = 0)1 What's wrong with the function W(x, t) you would get were you to insert this amplitude function into Eq. (4.29)1 Example 4.3. Construction of a Valid State Function Let's see what sort of wave packet we get when we use the amplitude function of Fig. 4.5b,16 { _1_ ko - !ti.k < k < ko + !ti.k A (k) =,.Ji5;k 2 - - 2 (4.32) o otherwise For simplicity, we'll consider only t = O.

V 211' ti.k x 2 The corresponding probability density, 1 4. 2 ( ti.k) P(x ,O) = 211' ti.k x2 sm xT ' appears in Fig. 4.6. Question 4-6 Evaluate the normalization integral for the state function (4.34). (4.34) (4.35) The wave function (4.34) has an infinite number of local maxima. Still, this function doesn't violate the requirement of spatial localization, because the peak values of these humps decrease as x increases in either direction from z = O. [This causes the envelope of the wave packet to die away to zero as [z] ~ 00.] Consequently the probability density defines only one dominant region of enhanced position probability, as desired. Nevertheless, the position of a particle in an ensemble of particles represented by this state function is clearly uncertain: the function in Fig. 4.6 has a non-zero width (.6.x > 0). Not surprisingly, the momentum is also uncertain (.6.p > 0). This result follows from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle or , putting it mathematically, from the spread of wave numbers that characterizes the amplitude function (4.32). Example 4.1 illustrates important features of the wave packets used in quantum physics. To summarize: A wave packet is a normalizable function that is peaked about 161chose the value of the constant A(k) = 11m so that the amplitude function would be normalized, i.e., so that J~ooA' (k)A(k) dk = 1. That A(k) satisfy this condition isn't mathematically essential, but it is convenient (see Â§ 4.4), and it takes care of the dimensionality problem noted in footnote 13. 112 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude PIx, 0) 0.15 0.10 Width = 1 0.05 Figure 4.6 The position probability density P(x,O) for the wave packet erected in Example 4.3.

This function is characterized by a non-zero but finite spread in the variables x and k. Wave Packet Motion and the Correspondence Principle In Example 4.1 we considered a wave packet at a fixed time. The way such packets evolve as time goes by is the SUbject of Chap. 6 (especially Â§ 6.7). But I want to show you one feature of wave packet motion now, because it illustrates the quaint and curious relationship between quantum mechanics and classical physics, a pervasive theme of this book. Each of the monochromatic traveling waves that makes up a wave packet has a phase velocity Vph = W j k, But the propagation velocity of the packet is, by definition, the velocity of its center. From your study of waves, you probably remember that this quantity is the group velocity and that (in one dimension) it is defined as V gr =: Ik=k o group velocity (4.36) In words: we can calculate vg r by evaluating the first derivative of the dispersion relation w = w(k) at the center of the amplitude function, k = koP We can easily figure out the group velocity of a free particle from the dispersion relation w(k) = fik2 j(2m). Applying the definition (4.36), we find that for the (general) wave packet (4.29), . liko V g r = m Po m [for a free particle). (4.37a) 17With the passing of time. most wave packets disperse (spread). But this phenomenon is not described by vg r â€¢ which provides information only about the propagation of the packet. Eventually. a packet may spread so much that it loses its definition; if this happens. the group velocity is no longer meaningful. Sec. 4.3 The Amplitude Function 113 Does this result look familiar? It should: it's the classical velocity that a particle of mass m would have if its momentum was Po: dE Iv . --c lassica l - d p P=PO Po= m [classical physics) (4.37b) Isn't that interesting? Be careful about how you interpret this little demonstration. It's very easy to be seduced by the similarity in Eqs. (4.37) into concluding that classical physics does pertain to microscopic particles. But this conclusion is not correct. What Eqs. (4.37) say is that a free particle wave packet with an amplitude function A( k) peaked about k = ko evolves in such a way that the position of its center, the peak of the dominant region of enhanced probability, changes at a speed identical to that of a classical particle with the same mass and momentum nko. It's important to note that (4.37b) pertains to a particle with a definite momentum, Po, while the wave packet from which we calculated (4.37a) has an indeterminate momentum (Ap > 0). This correspondence between the motion of a quantum-mechanical wave packet and the dynamics of a (related) classical particle is a manifestation of the Correspondence Principle (Chap. 2), according to which the predictions of quantum physics must reduce to those of classical physics \"in the classical limit.\" \"But where,\" I hear you wonder, \"is 'the classical limit' in all this?\" Splendid question. Look, a classical particle has a well-defined position and mo- mentum, so one way to take a wave packet to the classical limit is to reduce the position and momentum uncertainties to zero: Ax ~ 0 and Ap ~ O. classical limit of a wave packet (4.38) In this limit, the wave packet reduces to a probability amplitude that represents a state in which the position of the particle and its momentum are definite at each time [in fact, \\l1(x, t) reduces to a Dirac Delta function]. What we showed in Eqs. (4.37) is that this point moves through space at the speed predicted by classical physics.18 This insight is but a glimmer of a far more profound result we'll discover in Chap. 11. There we'll explore the classical limit of the laws ofmotion ofquantum physics and will find that in the classical limit the expectation value (x) (t) for a quantum state obeys Newton's Second Law, i.e., the wave packet for a macroscopic particle follows that particle's classical trajectory. Wave Packets in the Laboratory Do you feel as if you're drowning, getting deeper and deeper into mathematics, .leaving physics forever behind? Do you find it ominous that the next section is subtitled \"A Mathematical Detour\"? If so, don't fret. As we master all this mathematics we're really learning the language of quantum physics. But perhaps we should stop by the lab to see how an experimental physicist might produce a beam of free particles in a state that could be represented by a wave packet. 18The uncertainties in (4.38) are related by the Heisenberg Uncertainly Principle ~x ~p ~ h/2. From this relation, we could argue that the classical limit is that in which h is negligible and can hence be approx- imated by zero. This limit is sometimes written h -+ 0-an expression that is probably perplexing, since h is not zero at all; it' s a constant equal to 1.0546 x 10- 34 J sec. If you want to read more about the corre- spondence principle, see the excellent discussion in Chap. 8 of Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by R. H. Dicke and J. P. Wittke (Reading. Mass.: Addison-Wesley. 1960). 114 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude (4.39a) Such a beam would most likely be used in a collision experiment like the one sketched in Fig. 4.7. The source emits a beam of nearly mono-energetic particles-here, electrons-with energy Eo and momentum Po = v2moEo, where mo is the rest mass of the projectile. (For an electron, mo = m e = 9.109 X 10-3 1 kg.) The resulting beam travels a finite (but large) distance to the target, which might be a gas cell or a second beam directed at right angles to the electron beam. Scattered projectiles travel a finite (but large) distance to the detector, which we can move through space so as to sample the scattered particles at any angle. Detector .-----------, Shutter So~-O~-------l ~ electrons l Figure 4.7 A (rather crude) schematic of a collision experiment. The target in this experiment is fixed. As described in the text, by judicious use of the shutter we can produce a pulse of electrons in a state represented by a wave packet with a known width t1x . If the density of the beam is low enough that to a good approximation the particles don't interact and if the source \"prepares\" them so that all are in the same quantum state, then the beam is an ensemble (see Chap. 3). But what is the wave function that represents the particles in the beam? The nature of some collision experiments permits us to approximate this wave function by a plane wave (as the limit of an extremely fat wave packet; see Â§ 6.9 and 8.3), But in some experiments, the beam is \"chopped\"- rather like pepperoni. We could generate a chopped beam of electrons by, for example, placing a movable shutter in front of the opening in the source, as in Fig. 4.7. By rapidly raising, then lowering the shutter, we generate a pulse of electrons of length L. (The value of L is determined by the energy of the electrons and by how long the shutter is open.) This pulse is an ensemble of free particles whose state is represented by a wave packet. From the physical conditions in the laboratory, we can infer several features of this packet. For one thing, the position uncertainty of the particles in this beam is non-zero; in fact, Llx is roughly equal to the dimension of the beam: Llx ~ L. Consequently the momentum of the particles is not well-defined; rather, the state is characterized by a distribution of momenta that is peaked about Po, According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the momentum uncertainty is roughly Llp ~ 1ij(2L) . All of these features conform to our understanding of the nature of a wave packet. Aside: Wave Packets for Three-Dimensional Systems. In general, we must treat a wave packet in the lab as a three-dimensional function. The three-dimensional extension of the general form (4.29) is w(r t) = 1 JA(k) ei(k .r-wt) dk ' J (27r)3 ' where dk is a volume element in \"momentum space\" (e.g., in rectangular coordinates, dk = dk; dk y dk z ). The center of this packet, ro(t), propagates at the group velocity, Sec. 4.3 The Amplitude Function 115 (404Oa) (4040b) which is a vector determined by taking the gradient of the dispersion relation, viz., w = w(k) at k = ko, i.e. Vg r = V'kw(k) I Â· (4.39b) k= ko Fortunately, we usually need not consider explicitly two of the three dimensions of the packet's motion. This bit of legerdemain will be explained in Chap. 8. The details of how to construct such a wave function are interesting, but discussing them would take us too far afield. But before we leave this section, I should note that in a real collision experiment, we can set the mean values and uncertainties of the position and momentum of the incident particles, to the precision allowed by nature and human fallibility. These characteristics define the wave packet that represents the state of the projectiles. And that is how we create and use wave packets in laboratory quantum physics. *4.4 FOURIER ANALYSIS (A MATHEMATICAL DETOUR) In Â§ 4.2, we wrote down the general form (4.32) of a wave packet, llJ(x, t) = _1_ Joo A(k) ei(kx-wt)dk. V2rr - 00 At t = 0, this equation takes on a form that may be familiar: llJ(x,O) = ~Jcc A(k ) eikx dk. v 2rr - 00 Equation (4040b) reveals that the amplitude function A(k) is the Fourier transform of the state function llJ(x, t) at t = O. That is, the amplitude function is related to the wave function at t = 0 by a Fourier integral.l? Fourier analysis-the generation and deconstruction of Fourier series and integrals -is the mathematical method that underlies the construction of wave packets by super- position. Fourier analysis is a vital element of our quantum mechanics' tool kit, for we can use it to zip back and forth between the amplitude function and the corresponding state function. Moreover, the study of Fourier analysis leads to a deeper understand- ing of waves per se. When this method is applied to probability waves-i.e., to state functions-it leads to important, sometimes astonishing physical principles (see Â§ 4.6). For all these reasons, we're going to take a short sojourn into Fourier analysis. Mathematicians commonly use Fourier analysis to rip functions apart, representing them as sums or integrals of simple component functions, each of which is characterized by a single frequency. This method can be applied to any function f(x) that is piecewise continuous-i.e., that has at most a finite number of finite discontinuities . Wave functions, which must be continuous (see Â§ 3.5), satisfy this condition and so are prime candidates for Fourier analysis. Moreover, Fourier analysis is a preview of an extremely powerful mathematical technique: the method of eigenfunction expansion (Chap. 12). Whether we represent f (x) via a Fourier series or a Fourier integral depends on whether or not this function is periodic. Any function that repeats itself is said to be 191f you already figured this out and don't feel the need of a review of Fourier series and integrals. skip to Â§ 4.5. (You may, however, want to read the last subsection-e-on the definition of the width of a function.) If you've never studied Fourier analysis, you'll find a list of good references at the end of this chapter . 116 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude periodic. More precisely, if there exists a finite number L such that f(x + L) = f(x), then f(x) is periodic with period L. Perhaps the most familiar periodic functions are sin(21rx/L), cos(21rx/L), and exp(21rix/L). We can write any function that is periodic (or that is defined on a finite interval) as a Fourier series. But if f(x) is non-periodic or is defined on the infinite interval from -00 to +00, we must use a Fourier integral. Fourier series Fourier series arenot mere mathematical devices; they can be generated in the laboratory. For example, a spectrometer decomposes an electromagnetic wave into spectral lines, each of which has a different frequency and amplitude (intensity). Thus, a spectrometer decomposes a periodic function in a fashion analogous to the Fourier series. But our present concern is with the mathematics. Suppose we want to write a periodic, piecewise continuous function f(x) as a series of simple functions. Let L denote the period of f(x), and choose as the origin of coordinates the midpoint of the interval defined by this period, - L /2 S x S L /2. (This choice allows us to exploit the symmetry (if any) of f(x) .) The particular functions that appear in the Fourier series expansion of a periodic function are sines and cosines. Letting an and bn denote (real) expansion coefficients, we write this series as20 00 f(x) = ao + L [an cos ( 21rniJ+ bn sin ( 21rnr )]. n=l real Fourier series (4.41) We calculate the coefficients in (4.41) from the function f(x) as 1 jL/2 ao = L f(x)dx - L/2 (4.42a) (4.42c) (4.42b) (n = 1,2, . .. ) (n=I,2, . .. )2 jL/2 (X)an = L f(x) cos 21rnL dx -L/2 2 jL/2 X bn = L f(x) sin (21rn L) dx -L/2 Notice that the summation in (4.41) contains an infinite numberofterms. In practice we retain only a finite number of these terms-this approximation is called truncation. Truncation is viable , of course, only if the sum converges to whatever accuracy we want before we chop it off. A Mathematical Aside: On Truncation. Truncation is not as extreme an act as it may seem . If f(x) is normalizable, then the expansion coefficients in (4.41) decrease in magnitude with increasing n, i.e., lanl -+ 0 and Ibnl -+ 0 as n -+ 00 . Under these conditions, which are satisfied by physically admissible wave funct ions, the sum (4.41) can be truncated with impunity at some finite maximum value n llla x of the index n . Of course, a certain amount of trial and error is required to determine the value of n m a x that is required for the desired accuracy. 20Beware: the precise fonn of the Fourier series (and integral) representations of a function depend on the interval of periodicity; many authors choose the limits of this interval to be -L and +L . Sec. 4.4 Fourier Analysis (A Mathematical Detour) 117 Truncation is not the only simplification one stumbles across in working with Fourier series. If f (x ) is particularly simple, all but a small, finite number of terms in (4.41) may be zero. And you should always look for coefficients that are zero before you start grinding out integrals. This advice leads to the question: how can we spot such coefficients without evaluating them? That is, what (other than an accident) could make an expansion coefficient zero? The Power of Parity In Example 3.4, we saw that parity arguments can render integral evaluation trivial if the integrand is an odd function of the variable of integration. The same thing is true of the integrals in the expansion coefficients (4.42): they call for integration over a symmetric integral (from -L/2 to +L/2) of an integrand that involves trigonometric functions with well-known parity propertiesr'! sin( -x) = - sinx cos(-x) = +cosx (odd) (even) (4.43a) (4.43b) From Eqs. (4.43) it follows that if f(x) has definite parity, then either the integrand in an or that in bn will be odd: Rule If f(x) is even or odd, then half of the expansion coefficients in its Fourier series are zero. If, for example, f (x ) is odd [i.e., f (-x) = - f(x)], then all the coefficients an are zero, and we're left with a series involving only the \"sine coefficients\" bn â€¢ Such a series is called a Fourier sine series. The constant coefficient ao in (4.41) is zero for any function of definite parity. So if f(x) is such a function, there are two possibilities: f (x ) is odd [f( -x ) = - f(x)) ===? { an = o (n=1,2 , .. . ) f(x) = ~i ; sin (21rn~) f(x) is even [f( -x) = + f(x)) ===? { bn=O\"\" (n=1,2, . . . ) f(x) = L an cos ( 21rni-) n=1 Fouriersine series Fourier cosine series (4.440) (4.44b) 2 1For more on parity in Fourier analysis. see Â§ 5.10 of Advanced Calculus for Applications by F. B. Hildebrand (Englewood Cliffs. N.J.: Prentice Hall. 1962). 118 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude Aside: Functions That Don't Have Definite Parity. The Fourier sine and cosine expansions may come in handy even if f(x) does not have definite parity, because we can easily write any function as the sum of an even function and an odd function. Suppose f(x) is neither even nor odd [i.e., f( -x) :I Â±f(x)]. Let's define two new functions g(x) and h(x) as g(x) = ~ [f (x ) + f( -x)] h(x) = Hf(x) - f( -x)] . By definition, g(x) is even and h(x) is odd. Using these definitions, we can write the function f(x) as [see the next Question] f(x) = g(x) + h(x) . ~~ ev e n odd So for the rest of this section, I'll assume that f(x ) is either even or odd. Question 4-7 Write down the functions g(x) and h(x) for 1 _,,2 f(x) =\"2e + 7x and prove that each has definite parity. Fourier and His Series: A Historical-Mathematical Aside. As a brief respite from all this math, let's look back in time. The method of representing functions by series (or integrals) of sine and cosine functions was derived by a Frenchman named Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830). When young, Fourier dreamed of serving in the French army. (Had these dreams not been dashed, Fourier might not have become much .older.) But he was too adept at mathematics for the French government to let him become cannon fodder, so Fourier had to settle for a career as a world-renowned mathematician. In the early 1800's, Fourier set out to find a way to represent functions in terms of sines and cosines. To develop a series representation of a periodic function f(x), Fourier used a rather standard optimization technique. His first step was to write the function he wanted to represent as a finite series of the form K !K(x) = ao +L [ancos ( 21rn i )+ bn sin ( 21rn i )]. n=l The subscript K in this expansion indicates the number of terms included in it. Fourier then asked: what choices for the coefficients an and bn lead to a function f K (x) that most closelyapproximates f(x)-i .e., to the \"best\" such representation? His answer: the function with coefficients that minimizethe mean squaredeviation,22 1 j+L/2 -L [f(x) - !K(X)]2 dx. 2 -L/2 Fourier easily implemented that minimization via the orthogonality relations for the sine and cosine: (4.45a) 22We have met this sort of beast before (in Â§ 3.3); it is just a measure of the extent to which the series representation fK(X) differs from f(x) over the interval [-L/2 , +L/2] . Sec. 4.4 Fourier Analysis (A Mathematical Detour) 119 1 L / 2 COS (211'ni) cos (211'mi) dx =1 L / 2 sin (211'ni) sin (211'mi) dx -L/ 2 -L/2 __ {O, i.fm =F n ; (4.45b) 1, tfm = n. What he found-the optimum expansion coefficients-are those of Eqs. (4.42). . Following this signal success, Fourier went on to write a classic study of heat (which he believed to be vital to man's health) and then died tumbling down a flight of stairs. But his theory lives on. The Fourier series is by no means the only way to expand a function. (You probably know about the most common alternative, a Taylor series.) But its value derives in part from its wide applicability. Moreover, evaluation of the Fourier coefficients is usually comparatively easy. Because the integrals (4.42) involve sines and cosines, they can often be dug out of integral tables. Even if f(x) is sufficiently nasty that the required integrals are too complicated to evaluate analytically, we can always dump them on the nearest computer. (Computers love sines and cosines.) The Complex Fourier series If f(x) does not have a definite parity, we can expand it in a complex Fourier series. To derive this variant on the Fourier series (4.41), we just combine the coefficients an and bn so as to introduce the complex exponential function ei 27rn x / L; viz., DO f(x) = L en ei21rnx/L. n=- oo Complex Fourier Series . (4.46) (4.47) Note carefully that in the complex Fourier series (4.46) the summation runs from -00 to 00 . The expansion coefficients en for the complex Fourier series are l1 L / 2 .en = - f(x)e-'21rnx/Ldx . L -L/2 As you might expect, in general these coefficients are complex. Question 4-8 Derive Eqs. (4.46) and (4.47) and thereby determine the relationship of the coefficients Cn of the complex Fourier series of a function to the coefficients an and bn of the corresponding real series. Fourier Integrals I have emphasized that only a periodic function (or one defined on a finite interval) can be expanded in a Fourier series. To represent a non-periodic function in terms of sines and cosines, we resort to an integral: any normalizable function can be expanded in an infinite number of sine and cosine functions that have infinitesimally differing arguments. Such an expansion is called a Fourier integral. 23 The Fourier integral representation of a non-periodic function looks a little like the complex Fourier series representation (4.46) of a periodic function. Its general form is 23 A function f(x) can be represented by a Fourier integral provided the integral J::oo If( x)1 dx exists. All wave functions satisfy this condition, for they are normalizable. 120 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude f(x) = ~1Â°Og(k) e i k x dk y21r - 00 inverse Fouriertransform (Fourierintegral) (4.48) The function g(k) in (4.48) plays the role analogous to that of the expansion coefficients en in the complex series (4.46). The relationship of g(k) to f(x) is more clearly exposed by the inverse of (4.48), 1 1 00 .g(k) = - f(x) e- t k x dx ...& -00 Fouriertransform (4.49) In mathematical parlance, f (x) and g(k) are said to be Fourier transforms of one another. More precisely, g(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), and f(x) is the inverse Fourier transform of g(k). When convenient, I'll connote these relationships by the shorthand notation g(k) = F[f(x)] and f(x) = F-1[g(k)]. (4.50a) Our immediate application of Fourier transform theory is to the wave packet \\11(x, 0) and its amplitude function A(k). If we translate the relationship (4.40b) between these functions into our new notation, we have I A(k) = F[\\I1(x,O)] and \\I1(x,O) = F-1[A(k)] I. (4.50b) Many useful relationships follow from the intimate relationship between f (x) and g(k). For our purposes, the most important is the so-called Bessel-Parseval relationship: (4.51)Bessel-Parseval relationshipi:If(xW dx = i:Ig(kW dk. [Don't forget the absolute value bars in (4.51); they are essential if f(x) is complex.] Among the many applications of this relationship in quantum mechanics is the normal- ization of the amplitude function (Â§ 4.7). Question 4-9 Use the properties of the Dirac Delta function to prove the Bessel-Parseval relationship (4.51). How Wide Is My Wave Function? (A Short Discourse on Widths) Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers often talk about the \"width\" of a function. Unfortunately, these folk have been unable to agree on precisely what they mean by \"the width of a function,\" so in your reading you may come across diverse definitions of this quantity. But the idea is simple and the name appropriate: The \"width\" wx of a function f(x) is just a quantitative measure of its spread, its spatial extent. We have already seen (in several examples) that the width of any normalizable function is finite and non-zero: i.e., 0 < W x < 00. But beyond this observation, confusion reigns. In Fig. 4.8 you'll find some widely used definitions of W x ' To avoid further confusion, I want to get my definition up front right now. In this book I shall define the width ofa function f (x) to be the standard deviation of its position. Sec. 4.4 Fourier Analysis (A Mathematical Detour) 121 as defined in Â§ 3.3 [see Eq. (3.25)] . Hence the width of a state function llJ(x, t) is its position uncertainty Ax, as illustrated in Fig. 4.8c. 0.4 0.6 0.2 a 2 3 4 x (a) fix) 1.0 0.4 fIx) 1.0 fix) 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.2 Figure 4.8 A cornucopia of definitions of the width W;r of a function f(x) .

We can define a width for any function; for example, the width Wk of the ampli- tude function A(k) is a measure of its extent in the variable k (see Â§ 4.7). And, not surprisingly, if two functions are related, so may be their widths. For instance, there is an \"inverse correlation\" between the width W x of a function j(x) and the width Wk of its Fourier transform: the wider the function j(x) , the narrower its Fourier transform g(k). From an analysis of the Fourier integral (4.48), mathematicians have shown that 122 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude f(x) = .1\"-1 [g(k)] ==:} Wx Wk ~ 1. (4.52a) (4.53a) (4.53b) Question 4-10 Explain briefly why Eq. (4.52a) is true. Base your argument on the amount of destructive in- terference in the wave packet as the distance from the point of totalconstructive interference increases. Although Eq. (4.52a) is useful, it expresses this inverse relationship only qualita- tively. But the precise value of the product Wx Wk depends on the precise definition of Wx and Wk. With my definition of Wx and Wk as the standard deviations of position and wavenumber, this relation takes on the form IWx Wk = Ax Ak 2: ! I (4.52b) In Â§ 4.6, we'll translate this relationship into a principle (which you can probably guess now) that relates a critical physical property of a state function and its amplitude func- tion. 4.5 AN EXTENDED EXAMPLE: THE GAUSSIAN WAVE PACKET UNMASKED In Example 4.1 we used a known amplitude function A(k) to construct a free-particle wave packet (at t = 0) as a superposition of complex harmonic waves. Mathematically speaking, we were calculating the wave function as the inverse Fourier transform of the amplitude function: iii (x , 0) = .1\"-1[A(k)] = ~ JOO A(k) eikxdk. v 211\" -00 In quantum physics, we usually want to go the other way, to calculate the amplitude function as the Fourier transform of the wave function at the initial time t = 0: 1 JOO .A(k) = .1\"[IIi(x,O)] = rrc iii (x, 0) e-zkxdx. v211\" -00 In this section I want to illustrate this technique by examining an extremely important type of state function : the Gaussian function. In particular, we'll generate the amplitude function for a simple Gaussian function and then look at its width. What we discover when we do so will carry us back into the physics of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Â§ 4.6). Example 4.4. The Amplitude Function for a Gaussian The Gaussian function is a wave packet with a well-defined center and a single peak. Its amplitude function , which we're going to calculate, has the same properties. In Â§ 6.7 we'll watch the time development of a Gaussian function; here we consider only t = O. The Gaussian function contains one parameter, a real number L that governs its width. The most general form of such a function has a center at zo :F 0 and corresponds to an amplitude function that is centered at ko :F 0: Sec. 4.5 ( 1 ) 1/4 2 w(x,O) = 21rL2 e i ko x e-[(x-xo)/( 2L)] â€¢ An Extended Example: The Gaussian Wave Packet Unmasked (4.54) 123 (4.55) But for simplicity, I want to consider a Gaussian centered at Xo = 0 with an amplitude function centered at ko = 0, i.e., \\l1(x, t = 0) = (271\"1 L2) 1/4 e-x2 /(4L 2 ) . In Fig. 4.9, you'll find two such wave packets (with different values of L). Each exhibits the characteristic shape of a Gaussian function: each has a single peak and decreases rather rapidly as x increases from zero. But because the Gaussian function decays exponentially, it never actually equals zero for finite x . (It is, nonetheless, normalizable.) You'll also find in Fig. 4.9 the probability density 1\\l1(x,oW for a Gaussian. This figure illustrates one of the special properties of a Gaussian wave function: its probability is also a Gaussian function, one that has the same center but is narrower than the state function from which it is calculated.

The corresponding probability density for L = 1.0 is shown as a dashed curve. Question 4-11 Verify that the state function (4.55) is normalized. To see precisely how individual plane harmonic waves Wk(X , t) combine to form a Gaussian wave packet, let's evaluate the amplitude function A(k). We begin by substituting the state function (4.55) into the general expression (4.53b) for the amplitude function, viz., 1 ( 1)1/41 00 [1 ] A(k) =..j'ii 27l'L2 -00 exp - 4L2 X2 - ikx dx.

Letting 0= 1/(4Â£2) and f3 = ik in this expression, we obtain [for a Gaussian with X Q = 0]. (4.58) Compare carefully the mathematicalform of the amplitude function (4.58) and the (initial) wave function (4.55). Lo and behold: the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function of the variable x is a Gaussian of the variable k. (Please don't generalize: this reciprocity is not a general property of functions and their Fourier transforms; it is a special feature of the Gaussian function.) The Gaussian 111(x, 0) and its amplitude function are graphed in Fig. 4.10. As advertised above, the center of A(k)-the value of the wave number at the peak of the amplitude function-is at ko = O. Both the wave function and the amplitude function have a non-zero width, and from the (Fourier transform) relationship these functions bear to one another, it's not surprising that their widths are inversely related'\" [ct, Eqs. (4.52)]: W x Wk ~ 1. Normalization of the Amplitude Function In Question 4-11 I asked you to verify that the Gaussian wave function is normalized. Happily, we need not explicitly normalize the amplitude function calculated from this wave function, because a property of Fourier transforms-the Bessel-Parseval relation- ship (4.51)-guarantees that the Fourier transform ofa normalizedfunction is normalized: (4.59) 24Gaussian functions occur so often in quantum physics and chemistry that most of their mathematical properties have been derived and tabulated. You'lI find enough informat ion to work the problems in this book in Appendix J. which is based on the Appendix in Elementary Quantum Mechanics by David S. Saxon (San Francisco: Holden-Day.1968) . To find everything you could conce ivably want to know about Gaussian functions (and more) get a copy of \"The Gaussian Function in Calculations of Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics,\" which appears in Methods of Computational Physics, Volume 2, edited by B. Alder, S. Fernbach, and M. Rotenberg (New York: Academic Press, 1963). 25A word about widths of Gaussian functions: The conventional value of the width of a Gaussian function of the form (4.54) is W x = L/../2. This differs from what my definition gives, W x = ~x = L. The difference arises because many authors use L as the width not of the wave function but rather of the probability density . I further need to alert you that many authors define the Gaussian function in a slightly different fashion than I have, using L/../2 everywhere that I have used L. In a book that adopts this form , you'll see , instead of Eq. (4.54), the function ( 1 ) 1/4 2 2 III(x , t =0) = _ e- x / (2L ) . rrL2 Both forms are OK-after all, it' s the x-dependence of this function that identifies it as a Gaussian. I prefer (4.54) because it leads to simple expressions for the position and momentum uncertainties. But this multiplicity of conventional forms should cause no difficulty: you can rega in our equations from those in a book that adopts this alternate form by replac ing L everywhere by L/../2. Sec. 4.5 An Extended Example: The Gaussian Wave Packet Unmasked 125 -6.0 x 4.0 6.0 k Figure 4.10 (a) A Gaussian wave packet and (b) its Fourier transform, Note that the two functions have the same mathematical form [see Eq. (4.58)]. Also note that the constant 1/(2L) plays the same role in A(k) that L does in '11(x , 0). Of course, the Bessel-Parseval equality applies to any wave function and its amplitude function-not just to a Gaussian. And Eq. (4.59) comes in handy in problem solving, as a way to check the (sometimes considerable) algebra required to evaluate an amplitude function: you can be pretty sure that if you made a mistake in the evaluation of A(k), then the resulting function will not be normalized. Consider this a hint. The Width of a Gaussian and Its Amplitude Function Before leaving the Gaussian wave function, I want to probe further the relationship be- tween its width and that of its amplitude function. According to my definition , the widths 126 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude of these Gaussian functions, W x and Wk, respectively, are just the standard deviations tlx and tlk we calculate according to the expressions of Â§ 3.3. Example 4.5. The Product of the Widths Consider a Gaussian of the form (4.55) with L = 1. Evaluating the standard deviation of such a function is quite easy (see Example 3.5), viz., ~x = 1 .1 for l1t(x,O) = (2~)4 Â«<\": (4.60) So all we need is ~k. To evaluate this quantity from A(k), we just generalize Eq. (3.45) for ~x to a function whose independent variable is k instead of x: The mean values in this expression are (k) =i:A*(k) kA(k)dk (k 2 ) =i:A*(k) k2 A(k) dk. (4.6Ia) (4.6Ib) (4.6Ic) Now, substituting the amplitude function (4.58) with L = 1 into these equations and performing a little simple algebra, we find ~k =! 2 (2: )t e- x 2 / 4 â€¢for l1t(x,O) = .. (4.62) Combining this result with (4.59) for the width of the wave function, we obtain the product 1 ~x~k = 2 for (4.63) This result is a special case of Eq. (4.52b), according to which the product of the widths of two wave packets of any form is greater than or equal to l(}.. In fact, the Gaussian function is the only mathematical form for which this product equals I(}.. In qualitative terms, Eq. (4.63) just illustrates a familiar property of wave packets (Â§ 4.4): the greater the spread of the amplitude function . the narrower the extent of the wave function and position probability density for the state. Question 4-12 The amplitude function for the general form of the Gaussian, Eq. (4.54), is ( 2 ) 1/4 2 2 A(k) = ;L 2 e- i x o k e-(k-ko) L â€¢ Prove that the standard deviations in x and k for the general form of a Gaussian packet- (4.54) with arbitrary L-are ~x = L a'ld 1 ~k =-. 2L Sec. 4.5 An Extended Example: The Gaussian Wave Packet Unmasked 127 Time Development: A Glimpse Ahead Although I promised to wait until Chap. 6 to deal with the time development of wave functions, I can't resist showing you how easily we can write down a general form for w(x, t) once we have in hand the amplitude function. This function appears in the general form of a wave packet [Eq. (4.29)]: w(x, t) = _1_j oo A(k) e i{kx- wt) dk. (4.64) ...tiir -00 Since the amplitude function doesn't depend on t, we just insert it into (4.64) and voila: we've got an integral form of the wave function at any time. My point in showing you this is to suggest an important connection between the initial wave function and its subsequent form, a connection that can be made through the medium of the amplitude function: IW(x, 0) A(k) W(x, t) I (4.65) (4.66) Notice, by the way, that to generate w(x, t) from A(k) we must know the dispersion relation w(k) for the system. Question 4-13 Write down the state function l}I(x, t) that has a Gaussian with L = 1 as its initial value at = t = O. In Chap. 12, we'll discover lurking in the connection (4.65) a powerful problem solving strategy, one that can be applied to a wide variety of systems to bypass the task of solving the Schrodinger Equation. 4.6 UNCERTAINTY REGAINED One of the defining characteristics of a wave packet w(x, t) = 1:A(k) Wk(X, t) dk is its non-zero (but finite) standard deviation : ~x > O. If the packet represents a state of _ a particle at time t, then this mathematical fact has an important physical interpretation: the position of the particle is uncertain. Similarly, the amplitude function A(k), the Fourier transform of w(x,O), is char-- acterized by a non-zero (finite) standard deviation ~k. And, as I emphasized in Â§ 4.3, this mathematical fact has important consequences for the momentum: this observable is necessarily uncertain [Eq. (4.31)): ~p = liAk > O. Notice that this conclusion pertains to any state of any system, provided the state is represented by a wave packet. Were we to measure the momentum on an ensemble of particles in such a state, we'd obtain results that fluctuate around the mean value (P). This summary illustrates how in quantum physics mathematical properties of waves translate into physical characteristics of particles in quantum states represented by wave functions . The lexicon of the simplest such translations is the two de Broglie relations p = lik and E = tuÂ». 128 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude Let's see what happens if we use these relations to translate the fundamental wave property that relates the standard deviations of a wave packet and its Fourier transform, Return of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle The standard deviations ~x and ~k are related by [Eq. (4.52b)] ~x llk ~ 1/2. Trans- lating these standard deviations into position and (via p = nk) momentum uncertainties , we trivially regain the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP):26 (4.67) In quantum mechanics, we calculate the position uncertainty ~x from the state function \\l1(x, t) and the momentum uncertainty ~p from the amplitude function A(k) as llx = J(llx)2 = J(x 2) - (x) 2 ~p= nJ(llk)2 = nJ(k2) - (k)2 (4.68a) (4.68b) (4.69)(Gaussian wave packet) Note carefully the inequality in Eq.(4.67). Only one wave packet gives equality in Eq. (4.67), the Gaussian function of Â§ 4.4: 1 ~x~p= 2n For this reason a Gaussian is sometimes referred to as the minimum uncertainty wave packet. 27 Our derivation of the HUP is so straightforward that you may be tempted to over- look its profound implications. Equation (4.67) appears here as an inevitable consequence of our decision (Postulate I) to represent quantum states by wave functions that (Postu- late II) are interpreted as position probability amplitudes (and hence must be spatially localized). I hope this derivation convinces you once and for all that uncertainty rela- tions are intrinsic to the quantum-mechanical description of the microverse and as such are wholly unrelated to experimental error or defects in measuring apparatus. Note also the generality of our argument: it shows that the HUP is not limited to a particular microscopic system or quantum state. This is heady stuff, and I suggest you pause and ponder the subtle and beautiful interplay of mathematics and physics in the remarkably simple derivation of Heisenberg's profound principle. Aside: The Uncertainty Principle in Three Dimensions. For a particle in three dimensions with wave function lII(r, t), the rectangular components of position and momentum-the components of rand p along the orthogonal axes ex, ey , and ez - obey uncertainty relations like (4.67): 26Because these uncertainties have explicit definitions , some authors call Eq. (4.67) \"the precise uncer- tainty principle .\" Whatever you call it, this inequality is a special case of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (the GUP) . The GUP . which we'lI meet in Â§ 11.4. is an indeterminacy relationsh ip between the uncertaint ies of any two observables that cannot simultaneously be measured to infinite precision . As noted in Chap. 2. two such observables are complementary in the sense that the more we know about one, the less we can know about the other. 27you can prove this assertion by minimizing the product ll x IIp. For the details. see Â§ 10.9 of Quantum Theory by David Bohm (Englewood Cliffs , N. J.: Prentice Hall. 1953). Sec. 4.6 Uncertainty Regained 129 flxflpz ~ !h fly flpy ~ !h (4.70) flz flpz ~ !h . Fig. 4.11 summarizes graphically the correlation between the position and momen- tum uncertainties that is expressed mathematically in the HUP (4.67). For a narrow state function (Fig. 4.11a), the position of.the particle is rather well-defined (i.e., 6.x is small). But, inevitably, the corresponding amplitude function A(k) = F[\\l1(x, 0)1 encompasses a wide range of pure momentum states (Fig. 4.11b). So we know very little about the momentum of the particle in such a state, and 6.p is large. On the other hand, a broad state function (Fig. 4.11c) implies a more precise knowledge of momentum (Fig. 4.11d). With the translation of wave properties of the Fourier transform A(k) of \\l1(x, 0) into physical statements concerning momentum, we have broadened our insight into the physical content of the state function. Back in Chap. 3, we considered this function solely as a source of information about position. But in this chapter we've discovered how to extract statistical information concerning a momentum measurement (the uncertainty 6.p = n6.k) from the state function via its amplitude function. But this is not the only momentum information that lies hidden in A(k); in the next section we'll see how to dig out detailed probabilistic information about a measurement of this observable. ~7~OTQWT~ALLABOUTMOMENTUM As you've doubtless deduced, there is buried in the amplitude function a wealth of physical information about momentum . In fact, we can determine from this function probabilistic and statistical information about momentum that is analogous to the infor- mation about position we can extract from \\l1(x, t). To show you how, I first want to rewrite the general form (4.29) of the wave packet, \\l1(x, t) = _1_1 00 A(k) ei(kx-wt) dk, (4.71) V2ii -00 in terms of the pure momentum state functions I introduced in Â§ 4.2 [Eq. (4.26)]: \\l1 (x t) = _1_ e i(px-Et)/h . (4.72) p, ...hTrn To do so requires only a simple change of variable-but even so simple a task can hide traps for the unwary. Changing Variables in the Amplitude Function At first, the necessary variable change seems trivial. The de Broglie relation p = nk shows us how to change from wave number to momentum, so to write \\l1(x, t) as an integral over p we first define a new function-say, ~(p)-that is proportional to the amplitude function A(k). We then just write the Fourier transform relation (4.71) as an integral over ~(P)~p(x,t) expressing the differential volume element dk as dk = dpjn. This is a good plan, but I'm going to vary it slightly so as to minimize later anguish. I'll define the function ~(p) in terms of the amplitude function A(k) as ~(p)== ~A (~). momentum probability amplitude (4.73) 130 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude 'It(x, 0) 1.3 x -6.0 -4.0 -2.0 0.0 (b) A(k) Ak 2.0 4.0 6.0 k x o (d) k Figure 4.11 I1Iustrations of the inverse relationship between the widths of lIt(x,O) and A(k). Because of this relationship, the momentum uncertainty in the state represented by lit (x, 0) is inversely correlated with the position uncertainty .o.x via the HUP, Eq. (4.67). Notice that, by analogy with the position probability amplitude \\l1(x, t), I've dubbed cI>(p) the momentum probability amplitude. In terms of this function, the wave packet (4.71) at t = 0 becomes the momentum integral 1 1 00 \\l1(x,O) = -- cI>(p) e i px / h dp.

(4.73) and (4.74); I'll explain what I am doing in the next aside.] Sec. 4.7 (Not Quite) All About Momentum 131 The inverse of (4.74), the expression for 4>(p) as an integral with respect to x of III(x, 0), follows easily from the definition (4.73): 1 / 00 .4>(p) = -- III(x , 0) e- t px / h dx.

(4.76) to the Fourier relationships of Â§ 4.5 for III(x, 0) and A(k), these equations emphasize the physically important variables position and momentum .

(4.77) to a particular system , we must relate wand k via the appropriate dispersion relation . Once we have done so, we can express any state function as a superposition of pure momentum functions \\l1p(x, t) . Notice, by the way, that the momentum probability amplitude cI>(p) does not depend on time.28 Aside: Defining the Momentum Probability Amplitude. You may be wondering why I defined the momentum probability amplitude in (4.73) with an extra factor of l/,fii, rather than as simply A(p/li). Well, when we change variables from k to p, we have to somehow deal with the factor of 1/1'1 that arises from the differential relationship dk = dp/li; this 1/1'1 appears in the express ion for the wave packet as an integral over momentum . By including a factor of l/,fii in the definition (4.73) and absorbing the other l/,fii in the prefactors in the Fourier transform relations (4.74) and (4.75), we preserve a useful property of the amplitude function : automatic normalization . Recall (Â§ 4.4) that, courtesy of the Bessel-Parseval relation (4.51), an amplitude function A(k) determined from a normalized state function lIt(x,O) is automatically normalized with respect to integration over k [ef, Eq. (4.59)]. This means that in problem solving, we need normalize only lit(x, 0). With the definition (4.73) of <I>(p), automatic normalization is assured for the momentum probability amplitude- applying our change of variables to (4.59), we find I: 1<I>(p)1 2 dp =I: Ilit(x, 0)12 dx = 1. The Interpretation of cI>(p): Born Again same quantum state} My appellation for cI>(p)-the momentum probability amplitude-strongly suggests an analogy to the position probability amplitude lJf(x,O). In fact, these functions are differ- ent ways of representing the same quantum state (Â§ 4.7) that highlight information about different observables: \\l1(x, t) -> position cI>(p) -> momentum This analogy suggests that we interpret cI>(p) for momentum like we interpreted \\l1(x, t) for position. To jog your memory , here's the Born interpretation of \\l1(x, t) as a position probability amplitude (Postulate II): Interpretation of lit(x , t) : If the members of an ensemble are in a quantum state represented by the wave function lit(x, t), then P(x, t)dx = IIIt(x, t)1 2 dx is the probability that in a position measurement at time t a particle will be detected in the infinitesimal region from x to x + dx. 28Some applications of quantum mechanics are based on a time-dependent momentum probability amplitude cf!(p, t). This function is defined, as you might have guessed, as the inverse Fourier transform of the wave function at time t : 1 JOO .cf!(p, t) == -- lIt(x, t) e-,px/Ti dx .,j2;h -00 In practice, a time-dependent momentum amplitude is useful only in a very small number of cases-because the integral in its definition is quite ferocious. You can find a good discussion of these time-dependent momentum amplitudes in Elementary Quantum Mechanics by David S. Saxon (San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1968). Sec. 4.7 (Not Quite) All About Momentum 133 Now, a reasonable generalization of this idea to the momentum amplitude <I>(p), which represents the same quantum state as \\l1(x, t ), is 29 Interpretation of 4l(p): If the members of an ensemble are in a quantum state that is represented by a wave function 'It (x, t) with Fourier transform 4l(p) = F[ 'It (x, 0) J, then P(p)dp = IcI>(p)1 2 dp = cI>*(p)41(p)dp is the probability that in a momentum measurement at time t a particle's momentum will be found to have a value in the infinitesimal region from p to p + dp. This generalization is the key to calculating probabilistic information about mo- mentum from a wave function \\l1(x, t). And it buttresses the extension of our definitions of the statistical properties (x) and 6.x to momentum, viz., (P) ==i:pP(p) dp =i:<I>*(p)p<I>(p)dp 6.p == J(6.p)2 = [( (p _ (p))2)r = J(P2) _ (p)2 Expectation Value of Momentum Momentum Uncertainty (4.78) (4.79) In (4.79), the expectation value of p2, which we need to evaluate the momentum uncertainty, is just (4.80) To illustrate the application of these extensions, I've gathered our results (from Â§ 4.6) for a sample Gaussian wave function \\l1(x, 0) and its Fourier transform, suitably expressed them in terms of x and p, and tabulated the whole thing in Table 4.1. Question 4-14 Write the expressions for 'It(x,O) and for 4l(p) in Table 4.1 in terms of ~x and ~p respectively (instead of L) . Your results show the important dependence of the Gaussian function and its Fourier transform on their (initial) widths-a feature of the Gaussian to which we'll return in Â§ 6.7. 291n more fonnal treatments of quantum mechanics. such as befits a graduate course. Postulate II is stated abstractly as a way to interpret the quantum state descriptor in terms of an arbitrary observable. To see how this goes. see Quantum Mechanics. Vol. 1 by C. Cohen-Tannoudji, B. Diu, and F. Laloe (New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1977). 134 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude TABLE 4.1 POSITION AND MOMENTUM INFORMATION FOR A GAUSSIAN STATE FUNCTION WITH L = 1.0, xo = 0, AND Po = 0 Position Momentum l1t(x, 0) = (21r 1L2)1/4 e-;z:2/(4L 2) ( 2Y/4<I>(p) = ~Â£.. e_p2L2/1i2 1r h2 (x) = 0 (p) = 0 ~x=L 1 ~p=-h 2L Question 4-15 We understand the existence of a center Xo of a wave packet 'I1(x, t) as due to constructive interference in the superposition of complex harmonic waves that is the packet. For a symmetric packet this point coincides with the expectation value at t = 0, i.e., Xo = (x) (0) . Provide a similar explanation of the existence of the center Po = liko = (;P) of the momentum probability amplitude. With this generalization to <I>(p) of the expressions for the expectation value and the uncertainty, we've developed machinery for calculating all we are permitted to know about momentum from this probability amplitude. And an impressive menu it is: We can work out the probabilities of each possible outcome of an ensemble measurement of momentum as well as statistical quantities that characterize all the results of the measurement: the mean value Â«(p) and the extent to which individual results fluctuate about the mean (6.p). Underlying this scheme are a few basic principles: the de Broglie relation p = hk, the Born interpretation of a state function as a probability amplitude, and basic properties of waves. Still, the momentum probability amplitude <I>(p) is but one avenue to momentum information about a quantum state. There are others-which is good news, because in some applications, determining <I>(p) as the Fourier transform of the wave function \\If(x, 0) is an algebraic nightmare. But fear not. Chap. 5 is in the offing. 4.8 FINAL THOUGHTS: A WEALTH OF REPRESENTATIONS Our quest for a free-particle state function, which began in Â§ 4.1 with the complex harmonic wave and culminated in Â§ 4.2-4.3 with the wave packet, has taken us deep into the mysteries of momentum. But before I bring this observable center stage, in the next chapter, I want to reinforce the physics that underlies the mathematics of Fourier analysis-which led us into the world of momentum amplitudes in the first place. Underlying the application of Fourier analysis to the construction and deconstruc- tion of wave packets are physical principles familiar from Chaps. 2 and 3. Predominant among these is the omnipresent Principle of Superposition, which we saw reflected in our imagining a wave packet as a superposition of pure momentum states. Second, wave-particle duality is implicit in our use of the mathematics of waves to build and analyze functions that represent states of microscopic particles, as it is in our use of the de Broglie relations to interpret these states. And finally, uncertainty appeared naturally, almost as an afterthought, from our mathematical machinations. Sec. 4.8 Final Thoughts: A Wealth of Representations 135 This subtle interplay of the mathematics of complex functions and the physics of the microworld is one of the marvels of quantum physics. No one really knows why this mathematical artifice of man's mind happens to describe the real world so well; this is a question for philosophers and metaphysicists.P? The principal results of this chapter were the general form (4.29) of the wave packet, the Fourier transform relations (4.76) between the position and probability am- plitudes, and our finding (Â§ 4.7) that a state function yields (probabilistic and statistical) information about position or about momentum---depending on how we treat it. The algebraic procedures we use to extract position information from W(x,O) and momen- tum information from lI>(p) are identical; only the variables are changed. This powerful analogy is summarized in Table 4.2.

A state vector is not a function. Neither is it a vector in our geometrical space, ~3. Instead, it lives in an abstract vector space called a Hilbert space, where it is ruled by the mathematics of linear algebra. The state vector is usually denoted by the symbol IW(t)). Our wave function w(x, t) is the representation of this critter in (one-dimensional) \"position space,\" where the coordinate is x. Our momentum probability amplitude lI>(p) is its representation in \"momentum space,\" where the coordinate is p. In fact, one can devise an infinite number of different representations of a quantum state. Each represen- tation corresponds to a different observable: there is an energy representation , an angular momentum representations, and so forth. This more abstract formulation was developed by P. A. M. Dirac.\" Although later in this volume I'll show you a wonderfully convenient shorthand notation Dirac introduced for integrals, I won't show you quantum mechanics from his powerful but austere vantage point. At this stage, I want to keep matters as concrete as possible. 30But if you're curious to read a physicist's thoughts on the matter, you should read Eugene Wigner's fascinating essay on the interconnections between mathematics and physics. It is reprinted as Chap. 17 of his collection Symmetry and Reflections (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1970). 31Dirac's exposition of quantum mechanics, The Principles of Quantum Theory, 4th ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958)-which is now available in paperback-is a genuine classic that eventually should be read and re-read by every serious student of quantum theory. 136 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude Before we leave the matter of incarnations of the state vector, I want to make one final important point: Rule No representation of a state contains any more (or less) physical information than any other. This being the case, our decision to represent a state by llI(x, 0) or by ~(p) or by a function of some other variable becomes a matter of personal proclivity. In practice, the choice of representation is guided by expediency: we can usually find a representation that is particularly appropriate to the problem at hand (i.e., that saves us work). ANNOTATED SELECTED READINGS Waves You probably studied waves in a freshman or sophomore general physics course or in a separate course devoted solely to this topic. If not, you should have a look at one of the following excellent texts (arranged in order of increasing difficulty): 1. French, A. P., Vibrations and Waves (New York: W. W. Norton, 1961) (available in paper- back). This book contains an especially good treatment of superposition in Chap. 2 and of interference phenomena in Chap. 8. 2. Crawford, Frank S. Jr., Waves: Berkeley Physics Course , Volume 3 (New York: McGraw- Hill, 1968). An exhaustive treatment of waves that emphasizes their applications to nearly every area of physics. For interesting discussions of dispersion and the group velocity of de Broglie waves, see Supplementary Topics 2 and 4. 3. Elmore, W. C., and Mark A. Heald, The Physics o/Waves (New York: McGraw-Hili, 1969). Wave Packets and Uncertainty One of the most intriguing things to emerge from our discussions of wave packets was the uncertainty principle. For a more detailed analysis of the relationship between this important physical principle and the mathematics of state functions, look in nearly any graduate-level quantum book, such as 4. Rabinowitz, A., Quantum Mechanics (New York: Elsevier, 1968), Â§ 30 and 31. 5. Bohm, David, Quantum Theory (Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice Hall, 1953), Â§ 10.9. The same A. P. French who wrote the book on waves I recommended above has also co-authored an excellent quantum mechanics text (at a slightly lower level than this one): 6. French, A. P., and Edwin F. Taylor, An Introduction to Quantum Physics (New York: Norton, 1978) (available in paperback). This whole book is readable, insightful, and worth your time; but I particularly recommend their discussion of wave packets (Â§ 8.7). Fourier Analysis Fourier series and integrals are so important to the mathematics of science and engineering that any \"math methods\" book worth its salt will contain an exposition of this topic, usually with lots of illustrations. A treatment that is particularly oriented towards students of physics, albeit at a rather advanced level, is the one in Annotated Selected Readings 137 7. Mathews, Jon, and R. L. Walker, Mathemat ical Methods 0/ Physics (New York: W. A. Benjamin, 1980), Â§ 4.1 and 4.2. You can find a good summary suitable for undergraduates in 8. Arfken, George, Mathematical Methods/or Physicists, 2nd ed. (New York: Academic Press, 1970). Chap. 14 covers Fourier series, while Â§ 15.2-15.6 discuss Fourier transforms; the latter section is devoted to the momentum representation.

Problems 4.1 Construction of a Simple Wave Packet The general form of a real harmonic wave is given by Eq. (4.5). In this problem we shall actually construct a wave packet by superposing a finite number of such waves. (a) Draw an accurate graph of the sum of six real harmonic waves with the following wavelengths: ~ = 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, and 2.0 em. Take the amplitude of each wave to be 1.0 em. Adjust the phase constants so that each harmonic wave satisfies the condition f(xo, to) = 1.0 em. Sketch the composite packet for Ixl :5 10.Ocm. (Note : You will probably find it convenient to choose Xo = 0 and to = 0.) (b) Calculate the product of the spread w'\" of the wave packet you have formed and the range Wk of wave numbers included and verify that this product is a number of the order of unity. Remark: Notice that we do not obtain a single region of enhancement in this case, since there are always several values of x where all the constituent plane harmonic waves are in phase. Several regions inevitably result when we superpose a finite number of plane waves with wave numbers that differ by finite amounts. To obtain a single region of enhancement, we must superpose an infinite number of harmonic waves with infinitesimally differing wave numbers, as in the following problem . 4.2 Wave Packet Construction Can Be Fun Let's build a wave packet using a particularly simple amplitude function. The general form of the wave packet is given by Eqs. (4.29), where w = w(k) is the dispersion relation. (In this problem, we won't assume that particle is necessarilyfree.) Consider the amplitude function k < ko - ~~k; ko - ~~k :5 k :5 ko + ~~k; k > ko + ~~k. PART A Consider the initial time, t = O. (a) Evaluate the state function w(x,O). (b) Evaluate the position probability density at t = O. (c) Graph the probability density vs. z, and show that this wave packet conforms to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ~x ~p ~ n/2. [For ~x use the location of the first node (zero) of the state function. This number is an adequate approximation to the uncertainty and is considerably easier to obtain than the accurate value-which you don't need anyway for this problem .) (d) On your graph in part (c), graph a second curve showing the probability density at t = 0 for a value of ~k twice as large as the one you used in part (c). Hint: In parts (c) and (d), you may find it easier to graph the probability density as a function of the scaled variable x/ (21r/ ~k). Exercises and Problems 139 PART B In Chap . 6 we'll investigate wave packet propagation. As a preview. consider the behavior of the wave packet of part A at times t > 0, using Eq. (4.29) as a starting point. (a) To simplify the integrand of \\If(x,t), expand w(k) in a Taylor series about k = ko, retaining only terms through first order. Show that your result can be written w(k) = Wo + vgr(k - ko), where Wo = w(k = ko) and vg r is the group velocity of the wave packet evaluated at k = ko. Under what conditions on tlk is this approximation to w(k) valid? Hint : The Taylor series expansion of a function I(x) about a point x = Xo is I(x) = I(xo) + (x - xo)J'(xo) (x - XO)2 \" (x - XO) (n -l ) ( n - l) . + 2! I (Xo) + ... + (n _ I)! I (Xo) + remainder, where f'(xo) is the first derivative dfldx evaluated at zo, etc. The usefulness of this expansion is somewhat limited . because it can be applied only to functions that satisfy a rather demanding criteria: the derivatives of I(x) to all orders must exist and must be finite. Nonetheless, the Taylor series is invaluable. and if you haven 't studied it I recommend that you read Â§ 16.3 of Calculus and Analytic Geometry, 3rd ed. by George B. Thomas, Jr. (Reading. Mass .: Addison-Wesley, 1960). (b) Now, carry out the integration over k and thereby obtain an explicit expression for the state function and thence for the probability density P(x, t) in terms of z , t, vg r , and tlk . Verify that your result agrees with that of part (b) at t = O. How is P(x, t) related to P(x - vgrt, O)? What does your answer to this question imply about the propagation of this wave packet ? Does it retain its shape? (c) Let X m a x denote the position of the maximum of P (x , t ). Write an equation for the time dependence of x m a x â€¢ (d) Now suppose that you are sitting on the x axis-say, at a point Xo > o-watching all the waves go by. Describe (in words or with sketches or both) what you see. i.e.â€¢ describe the probability density considered as a function of time at a fixed position. (e) Let tlt denote the time interval that separates the arrival at Xo of the central peak of P(x, t) and the adjacent node. Show that this wave packet leads to the \"energy-time uncertainty relation \" tlE tlt~h. Remark: This extremely important problem reinforces the point made in this chapter: uncer- tainty relations are inevitable consequences of the use of wave packets to represent states of subatomic particles. More precise definition of the uncerta inties involved would have led to the \"precise\" uncertainty principles of this chapter and Chap . 11. 4.3 Coping with Complex Amplitude Functions Using Eq.

[Choose convenient (but reasonable) values for ko and L .] 4.5 Fooling Around with Gaussians The extended example of Â§ 4.5 concerned a Gaussian function (4.55), which is centered at Xo = 0 with an amplitude function centered at ko = O. In this problem, we'll consider the often-used more general form (4.54). (a) Evaluate the expectation value of x for this state . (b) Evaluate the position uncertainty for this state. (c) Gaussian functions are widely used in the study of the physics of matter. Suppose that W(x,O) represents a particle of mass m moving in a gravitational field with potential energy V(x) = mgx . Evaluate (V (x)) for this state. (d) Repeat part (c) for a simple harmonic oscillatorpotential energy; i.e., V(x) = ~mw~X2. (e) Evaluate the expectation value of momentum for this state. Hint: To simplify your algebra, let the center of the wave packet, zo, be zero for part (e). 4.6 Momentum Information for the Particle in a Box In Chap . 4 we used Fourier analysis to determine momentum information from free particle wave functions such as the Gaussian wave packet of Â§ 4.5. But we can also apply the mathematical analysis and physical reasoning of this chapter to quantum mechanical systems with non-zero potential energies. To illustrate, let's consider the simplest single-particle system in which the particle is subject to external forces: the infinite square well. In various problems in Chap. 3, we probed the stationary states of this system. The wave functions that represent these states have the form Wn(x ,t) = tPn(x)e-iEnt/li . For a one-dimensional infinite square well of length L , the explicit form of these functions at t=Oare { Jt cos (mrf) wn(x,O) = Jt sin (mrf) The (well-defined) energies of these states are n = 1,3,5, .. . n = 2,4,6 , .. .

For a change of pace, let's look at these wave functions from a different point of view: as sources of momentum information.

Tipler (New York: Wonh , 1969): . .. if we measure the momentum of the panicle in a box, we expect to find either p = +1ikn or p = -hk n , and the two possibilities are equally likely. Discuss the validity of this statement. Under what circumstances, if any, is it correct'! (d) Using your momentum probability amplitude <I>1(p), evaluate the expectation value of momentum and the momentumuncertainty for the n = 1 state of the infinite square well. 142 Chap. 4 An Illustrative Interlude CHAPTER 5 Observables in Quantum Physics A Pragmatist's Approach 5.1 Observables for Macroscopic Systems 5.2 The Trouble with Momentum 5.3 And Now for Something Completely Different: The Momentum Operator 5.4 The Operator Postulate 5.5 The Mathematics of Operators: An Introduction 5.6 Generalizing Our Expectations (and Uncertainties) 5.7 Operators and the Correspondence Principle 5.8 Final Thoughts: Operators in Momentum Space When I could find voice, I shrieked aloud in agony, \"Either this is madness or it is Hell.\" \"It is neither,\" calmly replied the voice of the Sphere, \"it is Knowledge.: \" -A. Square, in Flatland : A Romance of Many Dimensions by Edwin A. Abbott In Chap. 3 we learned a new way to represent one of the basic elements of physical theory: the state of a system. Because the state descriptor of classical physics, the trajectory, is inapplicable to microscopic particles, we had to postulate a state descriptor more suited to the microworld: the position probability amplitude III(x, t), the wave function. The second class of basic elements of a physical theory consists of the mathematical representative of observables-the physical properties of a system. The idea of an observable is familiar: the brilliant yellow of a sunflower, the taste of a ripe apple, the rich odor of a compost heap-all are observables of everyday life. In physics, of course, we concentrate on more quantifiable observables, properties such as position, energy, linear and angular momentum. In physics, then, observables are physical attributes of a system that can be measured in the laboratory. In classical physical theory, we represent observables by real functions of time; these are the \"property descriptors\" of that theory. Underlying this way of representing observables is a concept so intuitively obvious that you may never have pondered it: when we think about the physical properties of a classical system, we assume that the system \"possesses\" them. This thinking is mirrored in the way we talk about classical observables, in such statements as \"a billiard ball of mass 0.1 kg has a position specified by the coordinates x = 4.0m and y = 6.2m and an energy of 1501.\" Take a moment to think about this statement. It's based (implicitly or explicitly) on an experimental determination of the properties it addresses (mass, position, energy). It reveals that our sense that a particle can be said to \"have\" (i.e., to possess) such properties presumes that the only incertitude infecting such a determination is experimental error. That is, we assume that well-defined, definite values of x, y, and E can be associated with the particle-regardless of whether we measure these properties, when we measure them, or even which ones we measure. The task of the experimental physicist is to measure them as accurately as possible. But this notion is not appropriate to the microverse, for in the absence ofa measure- ment, a microscopic system does not necessarily have values of its physical properties-at least not in the classical sense of possession of properties. This disquieting notion first appeared in our discussion of the double-slit experiment (in Chap. 2): from the moment electrons leave the source until the instant before they arrive at the detector (where their positions are measured), they cannot be said to \"have a position.\" Rather, they are in a quantum state that allows an irfinity of possible positions. One of these possibilities becomes actual when an electron arrives at the detector. This strange way of thinking about observables was also implicit in the wave functions we examined in Chap. 4. Particles in an ensemble whose state is represented by a Gaussian wave packet, for example, don't \"have\" a position. Rather, their state encompasses an infinity of possibilities. We can think of these possibilities as latent in the state function until the observable, position, is actually measured, at which point one 144 Chap.S Observables in Quantum Physics actual value is realized. The probability that one or the other possibility will be realized is calculated from the probability density l\\lf(x, tWo The consequences of the latency of observables in an (unobserved) microscopic ensemble are profound indeed. As we'll discover in Â§ 5.2, it means that we cannot represent observables in quantum physics by the real functions of time familiar to us from classical theory. Instead, we must use mathematical instructions called operators- instructions that tell us how to extract information about observables from wave functions. The saga of operators in quantum mechanics begins in Â§ 5.3, continues through this chapter, and is concluded in Chaps . 10 and 11. My first job is to try to convince you that the representation of observables in Newtonian mechanics , which we'll review in Â§ 5.1, isn't applicable to the microscopic universe. To this end , I'll focus (beginning in Â§ 5.2) on a single, extremely important observable: linear momentum . Once I've shown you why the classical representation of momentum (p = mdx/dt) is incompatible with the physics of microscopic particles, I'll introduce the quantum representation of this property, the operator p = -ilia/ax, in Â§ 5.3. The use of this strange beast to represent momentum is the thrust of our next fundamental postulate (number III, if you 're counting), which I'll present in Â§ 5.4. To begin the process of getting acquainted with operators, we'll examine some of their algebraic properties in Â§ 5.5 and will test their compatibility with classical theory, in the appropriate limit, at the end of this chapter. A final note: I appreciate that the idea of representing a physically measurable quantity by a mathematical instruction probably seems mighty peculiar. So throughout this chapter, I'll adopt a ruthlessly pragmatic stance towards the representation of observ- abIes. Our goal will be to come up with devices that we can use to extract information about physical properties from wave functions. So think about operators as a quantum physicist's tools-the quantum mechanical counterpart of a carpenter's screwdrivers, hammers, and lathes. 5.1 OBSERVABLES FOR MACROSCOPIC SYSTEMS Observables are the essence of physics. Experimental physicists measure the values of observables in the laboratory. Theoretical physicists calculate them-e-either by hand or, more likely nowadays, on a computer. To many classical physicists, the goal of Newtonian physics is to understand the nature of macroscopic systems through the study of their observables; classical mechanics is a tool kit for predicting the values of these observables from the trajectories of the particles comprising the system. For even the simplest physical system, it's easy to think of lots of observables. Some are dependent on other observables; some are not. If, for example, we know the linear momentum p(t) of a particle, we can determine its kinetic energy T = p2/2m. But if we want to evaluate its potential energy V(r), we must know the position r. In any case, we can (in principle) measure the values of all the observables of a macroscopic system to infinite accuracy, secure in the knowledge that measuring one observable does not change the value of another (independent) observable. If, for example, we measure the position of a billiard ball, we do not thereby alter its kinetic energy (unless we are very maladroit) . In classical physics, observables are represented by functions of time. To under- stand why this strategy doesn't work for microscopic systems , let's see why it does work for macroscopic systems. Essential to the Newtonian description of a classical particle is Sec. 5.1 Observables for Macroscopic Systems 145 the premise that at any time the particle has a position and a linear momentum-and a host of other properties that can be determined from these observables. This means that we can ascribe (real) numbers-the values of these properties-to the particle, whether or not we measure them. These values usually change with time, so it makes sense to establish a correspondence between observables and functions: e.g., in one dimension we have CLASSICAL PHYSICS OBSERVABLE position momentum energy <==> <==> <==> FUNcnON x(t) pet) E[x(t) ,p(t)] This correspondence is the bedrock of Newtonian mechanics, the physical theory of macroscopic objects. Let's see how this correspondence works for a couple of observables for a single macroscopic particle of mass m. The position of the particle at time t is specified by the values of three real numbers, the spatial coordinates. 1 The most commonly used coordinates are r = (x, y, z) rectangular coordinates r = (r, (J, l{J) spherical coordinates Classical physicists define the other fundamental property descriptor, the linear momen- tum p(t), in terms of the trajectory, d p(t) = m d{(t) . (5.1) One reason the momentum is so important is that we can write all other classical ob- servables as functions of rand p. Some of these other observables are scalar quantities, like the total energy of a conservative system E = T(p) + V(r) p2 = - + V(r) . 2m (5.2a) (5.2b) For example, the total energy of a one-dimensional simple-harmonic oscillator with nat- ural frequency Wo is 1Remember that a coordinate system is just an artifice. In this book. we'll use primarily rectangular or spherical coordinates. But practicing physicists work with lots of different coordinate systems, usually basing their choices on the symmetry properties of the physical system they're studying. For example, a central force problem has spherical symmetry and hence is more easily (and more physically) described in spherical than in rectangular coordinates. We can define an infinite number of independent coordinate systems, but physicists most often use one of eleven special systems: those in which the \"Helmholtz equation \" V 2 1/J - k 2 1/J = 0 can be separated. If you want to learn more about useful coordinate systems, see Chap. 2 of Mathematical Methods/or Physicists, 2nd ed. by George Arfken (New York: Academic Press, 1970). If you want to have on hand absolutely everything you ever conceivably could need to know about coordinate systems, get a copy of Field Theory Handbook. 2nd ed. by P. Moon and D. E. Spencer (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1971). This awesome compendium of equations and facts is invaluable, although it isn't the sort of thing you would want to take as light reading on a vacation. 146 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics p2 1 E = - + _'f1UJJ 2 X 2 2m 2 0 Others are vector quantities, like the angular momentum L = r x p. (5.3) (5.4) (5.5) (5.6) All of these functions play a role in the dynamics of classical physics ; in fact, the laws of physics are relationships between these representations of observables. For example, the laws of motion of classical physics can be written as2 d dt P = -VV(r) d d d t L = r x F = r x d t p. But if we try to use such functions in a physical theory for the microworld, we run into the conceptual obstacle I noted in the introduction to this chapter: A quantum system does not, in general, have a position, a momentum, an energy, etc., at a particular time. So it makes no sense to represent the physical properties of such a system by functions of time. Does this mean that we must abandon the very idea of physical properties? Certainly not. The concept of position, for example, is certainly meaningful for a microscopic particle, for its position can be measured. The problem is that prior to such a measurement, the particle does not have a position in any meaningful sense. This is the essential difference between the position of a macroscopic particle and that of a microscopic particle: the position of a quantum particle is \"latent.\" It becomes \"actual\" only when someone measures it. This is true in general of the observables of quantum physics: they manifest themselves only when measured, so we cannot meaningfully represent them by functions of tirne.i' To summarize our problem: A quantum physics worthy of the name must consist of physical laws. These laws must be expressed in terms of mathematical constructs that represent measurable quantities of the system they describe. But we cannot write these laws using the property descriptors of classical physics . To discover what sort of machinery we do use to represent observables in quantum mechanics, we must probe more deeply into the problems with the classical way of knowledge. So in the next section we shall concentrate on a single, very important observable: the linear momentum. 5.2 THE TROUBLE WITH MOMENTUM What do we mean by the momentum ofa microscopicparticle? You may think I answered this question in Chap. 4, where I showed you how to use Fourier analysis to extract momentum information from a state function. But there is still a problem . 2To get through this book you won't need to know classical physics at a very sophisticated level. But if you didn 't realize that Eq. (5.5) is an alternative form of Newton 's Second Law, F = rna, you probably should spend a little time with your favorite classical physics book-or one of the Suggested Readings at the end of this chapter. 3 A tine discussion of \" latent\" observables can be found in Chaps. 8 and 17 of Henry Margenau's superb book The Nature of Physical Reality: A Philosophy of Modern Physics (Woodbridge, Conn .: Ox Bow Press, 1977). Margenau refers to the observables of classical systems as \"possessed\" observables. (I am indebted to Margenau 's writings on the meaning of physics for much of the philosophy in this book.) Sec. 5.2 The Trouble with Momentum 147 Physics is a pragmatic science. Its fundamental quantities are introduced via oper- ational definitions-definitions that specify, implicitly or explicitly, a series of steps that can be implemented in a laboratory. In her excellent survey of the physics of matter, Ginestra Amaldi discusses this important underlying principle of physics\" . . . one should not introduce into physics magnitudes which cannot be measured by means of an experiment , an experiment which can be executed-c-or if it cannot be executed because of practical limitations of the apparatus available is at least in principle feasible. .. . This principle . .. goes to the heart of the problem of knowledge. This principle is particularly germane to quantum theory, since the predictions of quantum mechanics are strictly limited to measurable quantities. In this sense, quantum mechanics is a narrowly pragmatic theory: it is mute about quantities we cannot study in the laboratory. Momentum Measurements on a Macroscopic Particle To illustrate the idea of an operational definition, which is crucial to understanding the trouble with the classical definition of momentum, let's contemplate a measurement of momentum. Consider first a macroscopic particle of mass m moving serenely along in one dimension. The classical definition of the momentum of the particle is d p(t) = m dt x(t). (5.7a) This is an operational definition, as we can see if we rewrite the derivative in (5.7a) as a limit. Letting Xl and X2 denote the positions of the particle at times t l and t2 , we have â€¢ X 2 - Xl P = m 11m. (5.7b) t2- t1 t2 - t l Equation (5.7b) prescribes an operational procedure: we measure the position of the particle at two successive times (as close together as possible) and calculate p from Eq. (5.7b). Simple, right? Yes-if the particle is macroscopic. Momentum Measurements in the Microworld Now let's think about applying this definition to microscopic systems. The argument I want to make is a little subtle, so follow closely. Consider an ensemble of microscopic particles whose state the instant before the first position measurement is represented by \\l1(x, td . Like the states we saw in Chaps. 3 and 4, this one corresponds to an indeterminate position [~x(td > 0]. So before the first measurement, the situation of the particles in our ensemble is like that of the electrons in the double-slit experiment prior to their arrival at the detector: they do not have a value of position. At time tl, we perform an ensemble measurement of position. For each particle in the ensemble, one of the possibilities latent in \\l1(x, t l ) becomes actual (e.g., spots appear). Therefore our measurement has changed the state of the particles in the ensemble from one in which the position was uncertain to ones in which the positions are definite. 4Ginestra Amaldi, The Nature of Matter: Physical Theory from Tholes to Fermi (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966), pp. 102-103, emphasis mine. 148 Chap.S Observables in Quantum Physics Now, our definition (5.7b) calls for a second position measurement at time t 2. How might we perform such a measurement? Well, we could start by selecting all particles in the initial ensemble that in the first measurement exhibited the particular value Xl. (This collection of particles is a sub-ensemble all of whose members are, at time tl, in the quantum state with definite position X = xd As time passes, the state of these particles will evolve into one with an uncertain position, so the second position measurement after even a short interval will yield a range of values. (We'll explore such measurements in detail in Chap. 13.) We could pick one of these, call it X2(t2), and calculate the momentum from (5.7b) . I hope this prescription makes you nervous; it's fraught with logical problems. For one thing, we don't know which of the positions exhibited at tl--or, for that matter, at t2-to use in (5.7b). You might suggest that we get around this difficulty by modifying this definition to use not particular values of position , but rather the expectation values (x) (tt} and (x) (t2)' This suggestion is insightful, but it doesn't resolve a second, far more serious problem: the measurement at t l changed the state of the particles in the ensemble. So the subsequent behavior of the particle is not what it would have been had we not performed the first measurement. In fact, the change of state induced by the first measurement alters the results of the second measurement. So if we use (5.7b), we don't really know what we're calculating! It's certainly not \"the momentum of the particle.\" It's just a number: the difference between an unmeasured and a measured position divided by a time interval and multiplied by a mass. But this number does not describe a property of the particle itself. In a nutshell: the formal problem with applying the classical definition of momen- tum to an ensemble of microscopic particles arises because it is impossible to measure the position of such particles without altering their state. This vicissitude is inevitable, be- cause prior to measurement, the particles do not have a position or a momentum. (Once again we see that it makes no sense to ascribe trajectories to microscopic particles.) That is, we cannot represent the observable momentum by mdx/dt, and we must resist the temptation to think about it in classical terms. Since the classical definition of momentum cannot be implemented for microscopic systems, this definition is, in quantum mechanics, meaningless .' Limitations of the Fourier Road to Momentum \"Wait just a minute,\" you cry. \"I remember that in Chap. 4 we calculated all sorts of information about the momentum of a free particle: the momentum probability distribu- tion, the mean value of the momentum, the momentum uncertainty. Are you saying that this information is meaningless?!\" Certainly not. It's not momentum information , but rather the classical definition of this quantity that loses significance in the quantum realm. \"But,\" you continue, \"it seems mighty strange that in Chap. 4 we could calculate information about an observable that we cannot even define.\" It does indeed. But the reason is that in Chap. 4, I deftly dodged the question of what we mean by momentum by basing the development on the de Broglie relation p = hk-in effect, I snuck up on momentum via functions of the wavenumber. In 5 For this reason. velocity is not considered a fundamental attribute of microscopic particles. In classical physics. the velocity of a particle (in one dimension ) is just v = dx/dt. but in quantum mechanics. velocity is defined as v := p/m. Sec. 5.2 The Trouble with Momentum 149 particular, we used this relationship to convert the Fourier transform of the wave function , 1 1 00 A(k) = .F[Ilt(x,O)] = tn= Ilt(x, 0) e- i k x dx, v211\" - 00 into the momentum probability amplitude ~(p) = ~A (~). (5.8) (5.9) Once we adopted the Born interpretation of this function , we could calculate various probabilistic and statistical quantities relating to momentum, such as the expectation value (P) = I:~*(p)p~(P)dp, (5 .10) by simply generalizing our definitions for position. The disadvantage to this route to momentum information is that it's circuitous and often awkward. Were Eq. (5.8) our only recourse, then in every application we would have to evaluate A(k). The algebra involved in this little chore is often horrendous. So for practical purposes, if no other, we need a more direct way to extract momentum information from state functions. But there 's another reason for looking again at momentum : relying on the de Broglie relation to avoid the question of how to define momentum is really a cop-out. The lack of a definition of so fundamental an observable is a gaping hole in the edifice of our theory. So in the next section we'll tackle this problem head on. Once we've devised a mathematical tool for extracting momentum information, our strategy will be to adopt this tool as the operational definition of momentum in quantum mechanics. Knowing how to represent the momentum (and position) of microscopic particles , we can write down tools for other observables. And thus shall we arrive at Postulate III. 5.3 AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT: THE MOMENTUM OPERATOR In a contemplative fashion, In a tranquil state of mind, Free of every kind of passion Some solution we shall find. -from The Gondoliers by Gilbert and Sullivan When I say \"we extract momentum information from a state function,\" I mean, of course, probabilistic or statistical information-for that is all nature will allow. We know from Chap. 3 how to calculate such information for position-for example, the mean value of position is the expectation value 150 Chap. 5 (x) = I:Ilt*(x, t) x Ilt(x, t) dx. Observables in Quantum Physics (5.11) But suppose we want the mean value of the momentum of a particle in the state w(x, t) and are forbidden (or, more likely, unable) to take the Fourier route of Chap. 4? We could reason by analogy, speculating that the mathematical form of (p) might be the same as that for (x); i.e., (P) = I:w*(x, t) p W(x,t) dx . (5.12) But now what do we do? What do we insert in (5.12) for p? To proceed further, we need a \"momentum extractor\"-a mathematical device that represents p in such a way that we can evaluate expressions like (5.12). Evidently, our momentum extractor should be expressed in terms of z, the variable of integration in (5.12). A Momentum Extractor for a Pure Momentum State Function To simplify our quest for a momentum extractor, I want to consider for a moment a very simple function : one of the pure momentum functions = _1_ ei(px-Et)/h \";27rn (5.13) that make up the wave packet W(x,t) =1:<I>(p) Wp(X, t) dp. In particular, consider the pure momentum function Wp(x, t) = (5.375 x 1Q2 m- ! ) exp{i[(4.9 x 1Q12 m- l ) X - (5.8 x lQHlsec-l)t]). (5.14) (5.15) (5.16) Our mission, should we decide to accept it, is to extract the value of the momentum p from this function. [No peeking; it's not fair to just read the value of p off Eq. (5.15).] What sequence of operations will, when applied to the pure momentum function (5.13), produce the value of p. Well, since p appears in the argument of an exponential, we might get it out by differentiating with respect to z, viz., ~ ei(px-Et)/f, = ip e i(px-Et )/Ti. ax n Notice that we must use a partial derivative in (5.16), because the function wp(x, t) depends on two independent variables, x and t. The first derivative almost does the job: this operation produces the momentum multiplied by i/n. To get just the value of p, we should operate on Wp(x, t) with (n/i) a/ax, to wit: (5.17) Eureka! We have discovered an operator-a mathematical instruction-that ex- tracts the value of momentum from a pure momentum function . I'll denote this operator by p and, because I prefer my factors of A in the numerator, use l/i = -i to write its definition as Sec. 5.3 The Momentum Operator 151 momentum operatorIp\" H~~-;nix I In words, this operator instructs us to do the following: p {::::::> differentiate with respect to z, then multiply by -iii. (5.18) (5.19) Throughout this book, I'll put little hats on operators to distinguish them from the ob- servables they represent. Question 5-1 Use the tool defined in Eq. (5.18) to extract the value of the linear momentum from the pure momentum state (5.15). A Leap of Faith: The Momentum Operator for an Arbitrary State The little demonstration above-and Question 5-I-shows how to use the operator -ilia/ax to extract momentum information from a pure momentum state function. But such a function corresponds to a definite momentum and is not normalizable; at best it can represent a quantum state only approximately. So how do we represent momentum in calculations involving the arbitrary wave packet (5.14)? The essential assumption of this chapter, which we'll make formal in the next section, is the obvious answer: use -ilia/ax to represent the observable momentum for any quantum state in one dimension. This assumption establishes the following correspondence: QUANTUM PHYSICS OBSERVABLE momentum OPERATOR P Aside: The Momentum Operator in Three Dimensions. For a particle in three dimensions, the momentum is represented by an operator with three components, Px, py, and pz. These quantities are defined just like (5.18), i.e., _ .\" 8 _ .\" 8 _ .\" 8 px = -I,. 8x py = -I,. By PÂ» = -I,. Bz' Such an operator is, sensibly, called a vector operator. The vector operator for linear momentum can be conveniently written in terms of the gradient operator V' as -inV'. A Mathematical Aside: On Eigenvalue Equations. Our basic assumption is that p can be used to determine momentum information about any state. In general, the effect of p on a function w(x, t) is to produce some other function of x and t . But something special happens when p operates on a pure momentum state function: [for a pure momentum state only) (5.20) Equation (5.20), which is not a general relationship , has a special mathematical form: an operator, in this case p, acting on a function equals a number times the function. Equations of this form are called eigenvalue equations. We'll encounter such equa- tions repeatedly in our journey through the wonderland of quantum theory and, in Chap. 11, will examine them in their own right. 152 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics Question 5-2 Show that when jJ acts on the function \\I1(x 0) = (_1_) 1/4 _ ,, 2/ (4L 2 ) , 27rL2 e the result is not a constant times \\11(x, 0). This means that particles in a state represented by this function do not have a well-defined value of the momentum (see Chap. 11). Back to the Expectation Value of Momentum (5.2Ia) (5.2Ib) Now we can answer the question I left dangling after Eq. (5.12): how can we evaluate the expectation value of momentum from the wave function \\l1(x, t)? Answer: merely insert the operator p in Eq. (5.12), viz., (P) =I:\\l1*(x,t)p\\l1(x,t)dx =I:\\l1*(x,t) (-ih:X) \\l1(x, t) dx. Equation (5.2Ib) instructs us to carry out the following steps: 1. differentiate \\l1(x, t) with respect to x; 2. multiply the result by -ihand then by \\l1*(x,t); 3. integrate the resulting integrand with respect to x. Perform these three steps, and voila, you have calculated the average value that would be expected in a measurement at time t of the linear momentum on an ensemble of particles in a state represented by \\l1(x, t ).6 Let's carry out these instructions for a specific case. (5.22) ~L < x < 00. -it. < x < 1L ' 2 - - 2 ' Example 5.1. Expectation Value of Momentum for the Infinite Square Well In Example 3.2 we looked at some of the wave functions for a single particle with a very simple potential: a symmetric finite square well. In various problems in Chaps. 3 and 4, we consider a simple variant on this potential, the infinite square well { - 00 < x < - ~Lj V (x) = 0 ~~L ~ x s ~L; 00 \"2L < x < 00. Notice that this potential is infinite everywhere except inside a region of length L , where it is zero. In Chap. 7 we'll study in detail the quantum states of this system, but for now I want to consider one particular state for purposes of applying the momentum operator to it. Like all bound systems, the particle in an infinite square well has a state of minimum energy. This state is called the ground state, and in this state the energy is well-defined (i .e., for this state tlE = 0). The wave function for the ground state at t = 0 is zero outside the region - ~L ~ x ~ ~L, and inside this region is proportional to a simple cosine function : -oo<x<-~L j 61n Chap. 7 we'll discover special quantum states called stationary states for which (P) is independent of time. But in general, the expectation value of any observable depends on time. Sec. 5.3 The Momentum Operator 153 Question 5-3 What is the expectation value of position for this state? Does your answer imply that the position of a particle in this state is definite-i.e., is the position uncertainty for this state zero? Why or why not? (Think, don't calculate!) Now, suppose that at t = 0 we measure the linear momentum on an ensemble of these systems in the ground state. To figure out the average value we'll find in the measurement, we insert the wave function (5.22) into our operational expression (5.21) for the expectation value of momentum, viz., (P) = I: Wi(X,0)p W1(X,0)dx (5.23a) = ~(-in)1 L / 2 cos (7r::') [.!!:.- cos (7r::')] dx. (5.23b) L -L/2 L dx L [Note very carefully the limits of integration in (5.23b). Be sure you understand why for this system these limits are -L/2 and L/2, not -00 and 00.] We can evaluate the integral in (5.23b) either by brute force or by thought. By now, I suspect you can guess which strategy I prefer: we think. Look ing at the integrand in (5.23b), we notice immed iately that one of the functions in it has definite parity: the cosine function is even with respect to the midpoint of the infinite square well, x = O. Therefore the first derivative of this function, :x [cos ( 7rI)] = -i sin ( 7rI), (5.24) is odd with respect to x = O. And we all know what the integral over a symmetric interval of the product of an even and an odd function is, right? Right: the integral is zero. Ergo, (P) = 0 (ground state of the infinite square well). (5.25) (5.26) (5.27) Question 5-4 Evaluate (;P) by explicit integration (just this once). Isn't it better to think before you integrate? Of course, we could have used the methods of Chap. 4 to calculate (p), first determining the momentum probability amplitude for the ground state of the infinite square well, 1 1 L / 2 .<I>(p) = -- W1(x, 0) e- t px / h dx, J27rn -L/2 then substituting this function into (P) = I: <I>*(p)p<I>(p)dp. But this procedure involves a lot more work (as you discovered if you worked Prob- lem 4.6). Before leaving this example, I want you to take a moment to ponder the physical consequences of the fact that in the ground state of the infinite square well, (P) = O. This result does not imply that the momentum in this state is well-defined, i.e., it does 154 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics not mean that in the ensemble measurement, all members yield the same value of p. Be sure you understand this point. Question 5-5 The energy of the ground Slate of a particle in an infinite square well is well-defined-its value (see Chap. 7) is 1l' 2 1i 2 E 1 = 2mÂ£2' (5.28) Now, V = 0 inside the box, so in the region where the slate function is non-zero, the energy and momentum are related by E = T = p 2 / 2m . Does the fact that the energy of the state is well-defined contradict the fact that the momentum is not sharp? If not, explain why not. (If so, we are in big trouble.) For future reference, here's the handy mathematical property we used to subdue the integral in Example 5.1. Mark it well: :x [even function of x] = odd function of x 88 x [odd function of xl = even function of x Momentum: Final Rum/nations (5.29) I don't want to leave you with the wrong impression: in this section, I have not actually derived the momentum operator.\" But I have argued that in quantum theory we must treat momentum differently than we do in classical physics and that it is reasonable to use the operator p = -in8/8x to determine momentum information from a state function 1It(x, t) . In fact, we are in the happy situation of having two ways to calculate the expectation value of momentum. We can calculate (P) from 1It(x, t) directly , a la Eq. (5.21), or we can evaluate the momentum probability amplitude c))(p) = F p [1It(x, 0)] and use Eq. (5.27). If we execute the required algebra correctly, both procedures will give the same answer, for they are entirely equivalent. In a few cases, the Fourier road is the easier of the two. But for most problems, evaluating the momentum amplitude is such a pain that we prefer to use the momentum operator. But enough about momentum. Lots of other physical properties are of interest in physics-energy, angular momentum, etc. Practitioners of Newtonian mechanics can represent these observables by functions of position and momentum and (perhaps) time. But we need to know how to represent observables in quantum physics. In the next section, we'll unearth a simple procedure for devising a quantum mechanical operator for any observable. 71}ifferent authors sometimes choose a different set of postulates in their formulation of quantum me- chanics. Some sets of postulates permit the derivation of the operator identification p = -iha/ax from Fourier analysis of 'I'(x, t), rather than postulation of this correspondence. Still other authors set up their pos- tulates so they can obta in this correspondence from the Correspondence Principle (see Â§ 5.7). Time permitting, you should sample several different ways of laying out quantum theory ; e.g., Chap. 3 of Introductory Quantum Mechanics by Richard L. Liboff (San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1980); Chap . 4 of The Quantum Physicists and An Introduction to Their Physics by W. H. Cropper (London: Oxford University Press, 1970); and Elementary Quantum Mechanics by David Saxon (San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1968). Sec. 5.3 The Momentum Operator 155 5.4 THE OPERATOR POSTULATE In Â§ 5.3 we established the fundamental correspondence between the observable mo- mentum and the mathematical operator p: in the quantum theory of a single particle in one dimension, p = -ina/ax represents momentum. The third postulate of quan- tum mechanics, the topic of this section, is a generalization of this idea to an arbitrary observable. The Position Operator The importance of the observable position in physical theory is comparable to that of momentum. In classical physics, we can write the functions that represent observables in terms of these observables, and in quantum mechanics we can express (most) operators in terms of the operators that represent position and momentum. In Â§ 5.3, we developed the operator p = -ina/ax for momentum, and in Chap. 3 used the operator for position (without so identifying it). Let's review. Look again at the expression for the expectation value of position, (x) = L:\\l1*(x, t)x\\l1(x, t) dx. (5.30) What does this expression tell us to do? Well, the first step in calculating (x) is evaluating x\\l1(x, t). This is an instruction (aha!) : it says \"multiply \\l1(x, t) by x.\" This suggests that we define the position operator x as x <=> multiply by x . position operator (5.31) This definition established a second correspondence, OBSERVABLE position OPERATOR :i: (5.32) Formally, we indicate the use of the position operator in Eq. (5.30) for (x) by just replacing the x between \\l1*(x,t ) and \\l1(x, t ) by x, as (x) =L:\\l1*(x, t) x\\l1(x, t ) dx. You may be wondering why I didn't define x in Chap. 3? It seemed to me that introducing so formal a definition so early in our introduction to quantum mechanics might appear to be a sadistic complication. But now we are far enough along to see the usefulness of introducing the position operator: since any classical observable can be written as a function of x and p, we can use the operators x and p to translate classical observables into quantum mechanical operators. That is precisely what we are about to do. Generating Operators Consider an arbitrary observable. I'll denote a generic observable by the symbol Q and will write the function that represents this observable in classical physics Q(t ) if I want to emphasize the time dependence and Q(x ,p) otherwise. To obtain the operator that 156 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics represents Q in quantum mechanics, we just replace the variable x in Q(x ,p) by the position operator x and the variable p by the momentum operator iJ, i.e.,s CLASSICAL OBSERVABLE Q( x,p) QUANTUM OPERATOR Q(i , p) In practice we merely insert iJ = -iha/ax everywhere in Q(x ,p) that p appears. (What should we insert everywhere that x appears?) To summarize: x p x â€¢ '10 a p = -z,,- ax (5.33) That's all there is to it!9 Example 5.2. The Energy Operator for the Simple Harmonic Oscillator To apply our new tool, let's work out the energy operator for a simple harmonic osciIlator (SHO): a microscopic particle of mass m with natural frequency Wo and potential energy (5.34) The first step in developing a quantum mechanical operator for any observable is to write down the classical function that represents that observable. In classical mechanics, the function that represents the total energy is the Hamiltonian H(r, pl. For a single particle with a velocity-independent potential energy , the classical Hamiltonian is just the familiar function'\" H[r(t) , pet)] = T(p) + V Cr , t) . The operator that represents the total energy of a physical system in quantum mechanics is also called the Hamiltonian. It is represented by the symbol it. To determine the Hamiltonian of a microscopic simple harmonic oscillator, we start with the class ical function H (x ,p) = T(P) + Vex) p2 1 2 2 -+-mwox . 2m 2 (5.35) (5.36) 8This procedure will handle nearly any operator. But in a few cases, the operator it produces isn' t unique. In others, the operator it produces fails to satisfy a vital property called Hermiticity (see Chap. II). Quantum mechanics has (advanced) machinery to deal with either instance, and such cases are so rare that you needn't worry about them. But you should be aware of them. 9Well, almost all. If the state functions we're working with are written as functions of position (and time), Eqs. (5.33) will generate appropriate operators. But in some problems we prefer to represent quantum states by functions of momentum--or of some other observable. In such cases, we simply translate the operators i , p, and Q into the appropriate \"representation\" (see Â§ 5.8). lOFormally, the Hamiltonian is defined in terms of the Lagrangian of the system and the conjugate coordinates and momenta of the panicles that comprise the system. This function is used in Hamilton's formulation of classical physics, an alternative to Newton's theory. For an introduction to classical Hamiltonian mechanics, see Â§ 7.12 of Classical Dynami cs of Particles and Systems, 2nd ed. by Jerry B. Marion (New York: Academic Press, 1970), or Â§ 6--14 of Introduction to the Principles of Mechanics by Walter Hauser (Reading , Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1965). At a more advanced level, you should peruse the beautiful development in Chap. VII of Mechanics, 2nd ed. by L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1969). There are close, subtle, and provocative connections between the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics and Schrodinger wave mechanics , as you'll see if you read Chap. 8 of the fine text Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by R. H. Dicke and J. P. Wittke (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1960). Sec . 5.4 The Operator Postulate 157 To generate the Hamiltonian operator for the simple harmonic oscillator we just apply the prescription (5.34) to each occurrence of x and p in this function, viz., â€¢ . . j/ 1 2 .2 11. = T + V = 2m + 2\" TTlW()X . (SHO) (5.37) Notice that the kinetic energy operator Â· 2 l' = L kinetic energy operator (5.38) 2m is independent of the potential and so applies to any single-panicle one-dimensional system. Now, suppose we want to use the Hamiltonian operator (5.37) to evaluate, say, the mean value of the energy of an ensemble of simple harmonic oscillators in a state represented by a known wave function 'I1(x,t) . By analogy with our expressions for (x) and (P), we write (E) =I: 'I1*(x,t)it 'I1(x,t)dx. (5.39) The first step in evaluating this integral is working out the effect of the operator it on '11(x, t) . So we write it in terms of x by inserting the explicit forms of x and jJ into (5.37): it = 2. (_in~)2+ .!:.TTlW~X2. (5.40) 2m ax 2 To proceed to the next step, we must evaluate (-ina/aX)2 '11(x, t). Depending on your mathematics background, you mayor may not know how to do this, how to act on a function with the square of an operator. In case you don't know, I'll defer the rest of this example until I've shown you a little about operator algebra (Â§ 5.5). To be continued. The Operator Postulate on Stage To close this section, I want to make formal the scheme we have deduced for representing observables. This postulate is on a par with Postulate I, which specified how to represent the other class of elements of quantum theory: states of a system. Postulate III specifies how to represent the observables of a system: The Third Postulate of Quantum Mechanics In quantum mechanics, every observable is represented by an operator that is used to obtain physical information about the observable from state functions. For an observable that is represented in classical physics by the function Q(x,p), the corresponding operator is Q(x, jJ). A final note: In Part IV, where we probe deeper into the formalism of quantum me- chanics, we'll learn that not just any mathematical operator can represent an observable. Like state functions, the class of observables of use in quantum mechanics is restricted. Just as the functions that represent quantum states must be complex and normalizable, so must the operators that represent observables satisfy a condition called Hermiticity (see Problem 5.1). Moreover, some operators in quantum mechanics do not correspond to classical observables. Indeed, in examining microscopic systems, we 'll meet some observables, 158 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics such as spin, that have no classical counterpart. And we'll make the acquaintance of operators, such as the parity operator, that can't be written as functions of :i; and p. All this is yet to come. Operators: A Historical Aside. The idea that the laws of quantum physics could be formulated in terms of operators was first propounded by Max Born, whom we met in Chap. 3, and Norbert Weiner. a mathematician and child prodigy. In late 1925. Born visited MIT. where he gave a series of guest lectures on atomic structure and solid state physics. There he renewed his acquaintance with Weiner. who was an instructor in mathematics. At this time Schrodinger had not published his wave mechanics. and Born and the rest of the physics community were using a theory, due to the ubiquitous Werner Heisenberg. in which observables were represented by matrices.11 Weiner, who received his Ph.D. at the ripe old age of 18, was already an expert on \"the operator calculus,\" which he learned while using Fourier analysis to unravel the complicated electrical oscillations that make up information in telephone Iines.12 Listening to Born lecture about Heisenberg's ideas, Weiner realized that these ideas could be usefully expressed in the language of operators. This realization sparked a collaboration that ultimately led to a formulation of quantum theory that, although incomplete, was more powerful and more widely applicable than matrix mechanics- especiaIly for Born's beloved atomic collision problems. Unfortunately. Born and Weiner did not fuIly develop their theory, and hence their contribution did not have the impact it might have. Although they used an operator pfor linear momentum, they did not spot the vital connection p = -iii a/ax. And their timing was rotten, for within a few months (in 1926) Erwin Schrodinger stunned the physics community with his wave mechanics, which immediately became the formulation of choice. Born has commented on his oversight: \"I shaIl never forgive myself, because if we had done this, we would have had the whole wave mechanics at once, a few months before SchrOdinger.\"13 Born and Weiner applied their theory successfully to the microscopic simple harmonic oscillator (Example 5.2) and to uniform motion in one dimension. And, although their work was almost immediately overshadowed by Schrodinger's, their idea of using operators in quantum mechanics was here to stay. A host of physicists further developed operator mechanics-notably, Paul A. M. Dirac-and their work is now an essential pan of the repertoire of every practicing quantum mechanic. 5.5 THE MATHEMATICS OF OPERATORS: AN INTRODUCTION We need education in the obvious more than investigation into the obscure. -Oliver WendeIl Holmes Norbert Weiner, who with Max Born devised the operator postulate, learned operator mechanics as part of his training as a mathematician. And this subject is properly considered a branch of mathematics. In the 18th century, differential calculus was all the llHeisenberg's theory is still in use today, under the appropriate name matrix mechanics. For an introduction to this alternate approa ch to quantum mechanics, see Matrix Mechanics by H. S. Green (The Netherlands : P. Noordhoff, Ltd., 1965). 12Weiner was a fascinating man, and if you are at all interested in the lives of the shapers of contempo- rary physics, look up his autobiography, which he modestly (and appropriately) entitled I Am A Mathematician: The Later Life of a Prodigy (Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday , 1956). 13Quoted in The Historical Development of Quantum Theory, Volume 3 by J. Mehra and H. Rechenberg (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1982). Sec. 5.5 The Mathematics of Operators: An Introduction 159 rage. But many mathematicians were uncomfortable with the \"metaphysical implications\" of a mathematics formulated in terms of infinitesimal quantities (like dx). This disquiet was the stimulus for the development of the operator calculus.I\" Two 18th-century mathematicians, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) and Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) founded the operator method. But the formal theory that Born and Weiner adapted to quantum mechanics was developed later by three men: Francois Joseph Servois, Robert Murphy, and George Boole. You may have heard of Boole for his \"Boolean algebra\"-a theory based on operator methods in which Boole, who was nothing if not ambitious, tried to explain all of mathematics. To anyone who has studied calculus, operators are familiar critters. Indeed, the es- sential elements of calculus are operators: the derivative a/ax and the integral JX ... dx'. (The centered dots in this integral represent the function being integrated; e.g., sin x' in JX sin x' dx'.) An operator, then, is just an instruction, a symbol that tells us to perform one or more mathematical acts on a function-say, f(x). The result is another function g(x), which may be a constant: For this reason, the effect of operators is sometimes denoted by the symbol ......... Here are two equivalent ways of writing the effect of an operator Q on a function f(x): g(x) = Qf(x) Q: f(x) ........ g(x). The essential point about operators is that they act on functions; we might think of operators as analogous to active verbs in English, with functions as their objects. The instruction we are told to perform may be as trivial as \"multiply f(x) by the constant 4,\" e.g., 4f(x) = 4f(x ), (5.41) or as complicated as \"integrate f(x) along a specified contour in the complex plane.\" A sampler of operators is presented in Table 5.1. TABLE 5.1 A SAMPLER OF OPERATORS Symbol Instructions Example :3 multiply by 3 :3 f(x) = 3f(x) A â€¢ d differentiate once Af(x ) = - f (x) dx B fonn complex conjugate B f(x) = j*(x) 6 destroy 6 f(x) = 0 b expand in Taylor series . E oo 1 dn fDf(x) = _x n _ n=O n! dx\" Working with Operators Every quantum mechanic must be able to manipulate, combine, and simplify expressions containing operators-expressions such as xp - px. To flawlessly manipulate such 14For a history of the development of the operator calculus . see the article by Salvatore Pincherle in Encykl. d. math. Wiss. llt l , Pan 2 (issue no. 6, March 1906. pp. 761-817). 160 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics expressions, you must remember that like surgeons, operators must operate on something. An operator without a function is like a verb without an object. You're much more likely to do your operator algebra correctly if you will follow this rule: Rule Always write operator expressions and equations in terms of a general function j(x) . Suppose, for example, we want to simplify the operator expression xp - px (as we shall in Example 5.4). Our first step should be to write this expression in terms of a generic function f(x), as xpf(x) - pxf(x) . Then we try to simplify. In such manipulations, it's also important to keep in mind that15 Rule Operators act on everything to their right unless their action is constrained by brackets. Thus, when we write pft(x)h(x), we mean p[ft(x)h(x)], not lPft(x)] times h(x). (Do you see the difference?) Operator Algebra Mastering the algebra of operators isn't particularly difficult. But you must be wary lest you inadvertently slip into patterns of thought familiar from your experience with the mathematics of numbers and functions. Operators are not just funny-looking numbers or functions: the algebra of operators is, in some important respects, quite different from that of numbers or functions. To appreciate the distinction between operators and other mathematical species, let's consider a simple example. Let the symbol A represent a real number, say A == 3. Suppose that for some reason we need to evaluate the combination Af(x)g(x). Does the position of A in this expression make any difference? No-real numbers commute with functions; e.g., 3f(x) = f(x)3. So we can write the expression Af(x)g(x) in several equivalent ways: Af(x)g(x) = f(x)Ag(x) = g(x)Af(x) 3f(x)g(x) = f(x)3g(x) = g(x)3f(x) (5.420) (5.42b) This trivial example illustrates the principle of commutativity of real numbers. Does this principle apply to operators? To find out, let's try one-say, the simple operator A == d/dx. The first expression in (5.420) is 15There is an important exception to this rule. The infinitesimal in an integral operator is part of the instruction. For example , dx' in A == J'\" ...dx' is part of the integration operator, so Af(x) = J'\" f(x')dx'. This is one reason mathematicians sometimes write the integrand after the infinitesimal. as J'\" dx' . . . . Sec. 5.5 The Mathematics of Operators: An Introduction 161 And the second is â€¢ d A f(x)g(x) = dxf(x)g(x) d d = f(x) dxg(x) + g(x) dxf(x). â€¢ d f(x)Ag(x) = f(x) dxg(x). (5.43a) (5.43b) (5.44) Except in certain special cases (5.44) is not the same as (5.43b). (And for A = d/dx, the third expression, f(x)g(x).A is meaningless.) The moral of this trifling exercise is: WARNING Relations that are \"obvious\" from our experience with real numbers and functions may be incorrect when extended (without thought) to operators. How to Cope with Sums, Differences, and Products In this book, you'll only need mastery of the simplest features of the algebra of operators. The simplest operator manipulations-addition and subtraction-rarely pose problems. As you can readily verify, two operators Ql and Q2 can be added or subtracted according to the familiar rules (Ql Â± Q2) f(x) = Ql f(x) Â± Q2 f(x) = Â±Q2f(x) + Qd(x) [ addition ] subtraction (5.45) h(x) = Ql Q2f(x ) Mathematicians refer to this property as distributivity. More interesting is what happens when we form the product of two (or more) operators. The product Ql Q2 cannot be treated like the products of two numbers or of two functions. Instead, the rules of operator algebra assign to the product combination the following meaning: Rule The product of operators implies successive operation. For instance, to evaluate Ql Q2f(x), we first act on f(x) with Q2 to form a new function of x-call it g(x). We then act on g(x) with Ql to form the desired function. That is, we can break this product down into two operations: { ~2:f(x) 1-+ g(x) Ql:g(X) 1-+ h(x) Notice that I've used the mathematician 's symbol 1-+ to vivify the active role of the operators Ql and Q2. This little analysis demonstrates the following rule: 162 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics Rule The product of two operators is a third operator . So we could write the product considered above by defining yet a third operator, Q3, that is equivalent to the product, viZ.,16 and h(x) = Q3f(x). (5.46) Please pay special attention to the meaning of operator products. This is the facet of operator algebra that most often trips up newcomers to quantum mechanics. So etch the above rule in your memory. Example 5.3. The Kinetic Energy Operator Revisited Using the simple rules of this section in hand, we can finish Example 5.2. There we set out to develop an expression for the Hamiltonian of a simple harmonic oscillator in terms of operators and functions of x. We developed the following expression for this Hamiltonian [Eq. (5.40)): -u 1 ( 'liO)2 1 2 .2,. = - -t - + -TnWox . 2m ax 2 (5.47) To complete our labors, we must simplify the first term in (5.47), the kinetic energy operator ; i.e., we must work out the effect on a function f (x) of the square of the momentum operator Â· 2p . According to the above guidelines , the wrong way to evaluate ji is to treat it as though jJ were a function, i.e., The right way is to follow instructions: operate on f(x) twice in succession with jJ: jJ2f(x) = jJjJf(x ) 2 d 2 = -Ii dx 2 f(x) . Ergo the form of the kinetic energy operator we use to act on functions of x is (5.48a) (5.48b) - 2 - pT=- 2m kinetic energy operator (5.49) With this operator, the desired Hamiltonian (5.47) is simply (5.50)[one-dimension simple harmonic oscillator]-u = li 2 02 1 2 . 2 f. - 2m 8x 2 + 2TnWOX . In Chap. 9, we'll study the state functions of the simple harmonic oscillator that we obtain from this Hamiltonian. 16Two operators Q and R are said 10 be equivalent if for all functions I(x), they satisfy QI (x ) = RI(x) . equivalent operators Sec. 5.5 The Mathematics of Operators : An Introduction 163 The Commutator: A Sneak Preview What are commuting operators? Ones that drive to work? No, no. Two operators 01 and 02commute if they obey the simple operator expression commuting operators (5.51) Ponder this equation carefully. If it seems to you that any two operators should obey it, then you're thinking about operators as though they were real numbers, and are in trouble. The critical feature of Eq. (5.51) is that it's an operator equation. Since operators must operate on functions, it follows that Rule To be valid an operator equation must hold for an arbitrary (well-behaved) function f (x ). This rule is the key to verifying valid operator equations-and exposing invalid ones. I can't overemphasize this point: if an operator equation is true, it must hold for any function. But if it fails for a single function, then it's false. If, for example, you are investigating two operators 01 and 02 and can find one function for which 0102 f(x) =I 0201 f(x), then you have proven that 01 and 02 do not commute. Let's get specific. Consider the operators â€¢ d Q1 =- dx 02 = x. (5.52) (5.53) Let these guys act on the function f (x) = e 2x â€¢ What happens? To find out, first evaluate 0102 f (x), then evaluate 0201 f(x). You should have found that the functions that result from these operator products differ depending on the order in which 01 and 02act, i.e., (5.54) The fact that Eq. (5.51) does not hold for the single function f(x ) = e2x is enough to prove that the operators djdx and x do not commute, i.e., d â€¢ ...J. â€¢ d -Xr- X-' dx dx As always, my examples have a moral. This one is: (5.55) WARNING The order in which the operators operate is vital; never assume that two operators commute. Always check their commutativity. 164 Chap.S Observables in Quantum Physics Mathematical Aside: Commutativity of Functions. Non-commutativity isn't a problem for functions such as f(x) and g(x) or real numbers (such as a and b), since the algebras of real numbers and of functions are commutative, i.e., a Â·b=bÂ·a f(x)g(x) = g(x)f(x) (5.56a) (5.56b) Question 5-6 Dream up some pairs of operators that do commute. Now come up with some pairs that do not commute. Of all the mathematical peculiarities of operators we've examined, their commu- tativity (or non-commutativity) is most important physically. In Chap. 11, we'll unearth a remarkable connection between this property of operators and uncertainty relations involving observables. As a sneak preview, I'll close this section with an important example. Example 5.4. Do Position and Momentum Commute? Consider the operator Q == xp - px. Were we to encounter this operator in a quantum mechanics problem, our first thought would be to try to simplify it-to reduce it, if possible, to a simpler operator.l\" But before tackling this chore, we'd write its definition in terms of a generic function, as Qf(x) = xpf(x) - fJXf(x) . (5.57) We begin the task of simplifying Qby writing Eq. (5.57) in terms of x by inserting into this equation explicit forms for p and x, viz., Qf(x) = x [-ilia':f(x)] - (-ili;x) [xf(x)] = -iliX:~+ili d : [xf(x)] . (5.58a) (5.58b) Now we expand the first derivative in the second term in Eq. (5.58b) to give two terms, one of which cancels the first term in (5.58b). This manipulation leads to a delightfully simple form for Q: Qf(x) = ilif(x) . (5.59) To write (5.59) as an operator equation, I must introduce the identity operator 1, which does very little: if(x) = f(x). identity operator (5.60) Voila: Ixp - fJX = ilii I (5.61) We have discovered the curious fact that operating on a function with this particular com- bination of x and p is equivalent to multiplying the function by a constant. Amazingly, this fact leads to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! (Isn 't quantum mechanics fantastic!) But to see how, you must wait for Chap . II. 17 Q is a critter called a commutator (Chap II). In particular. xp - px is the commutator of position and momentum. which is denoted [x, pl. Sec. 5.5 The Mathematics of Operators: An Introduction 165 5.6 GENERALIZING OUR EXPECTATIONS (AND UNCERTAINTIES) What do we do with operators once we have found them? Well, one common application is the calculation of expectation values and uncertainties for various quantum states. You now know how to use Postulate III to design the operator Qthat represents whatever observable Q we're interested in. So if I give you the wave function w(x , t ) that represents such a state, you can evaluate these two pieces of statistical information about the state from the following straightforward generalizations of familiar equations: 18 (Q) = i:w*(x, t)Qw(x , t) dx expectation value of an arbitrary observable (5.62) !:.Q ==J((Q - (Q))2) = J(Q2) - (Q)2. uncertainty of an arbitrary observable (5.63) To illustrate the use of these expressions, let's return to the ground state of the infinite square well (Example 5.1). Example 5.5. The Momentum Uncertainty for the Ground State of the Infinite Square Well The wave function of this state, Wl(X,O), is given in Eq. (5.22). In Example 5.1, we discovered that the expectation value of momentum for this state is w) = 0. So in a measurement of the momentum performed at t =Â°on an ensemble consisting of a huge number of identical particle-in-a-box systems, each in the ground state, the average of the values we'd get is zero. To predict how these values are distributed about this mean, we must calculate the momentum uncertainty which for this state simplifies to (5.64) for a state in which W) = 0. (5.65) So to determine the momentum uncertainty, we need only evaluate (p2) =I:w* (x, t) p2W(x, t) dx J OC {)2 =-Ii? - oc w*(x , t ) {) x 2 w(x, t) dx . This isn't hard. For the wave function Wl(X,O) in Eq. (5.22) we have (5.660) (5.66b) (5.67a) (5.67b) l8We could justify these expressions formally via extensions of the arguments used in Chap. 3 [cf, the discussion surround ing Eq. (3.40 )1. I should note, however, that some authors treat Eq. (5.62) as a pan of Postulate III. 166 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics Note carefully that I changed the partial derivative with respect to x in (5.66) to an ordi- nary derivative, because x is the only variable in Eqs. (5.67)-and watch those limits of integration! Now, can we use parity to simplify the integral in (5.67b)? Well, the integrand has definite parity, but it's even-not odd. So the integral isn't equal to zero. We can, however, write this integral as (5.68) We can now integrate by parts. If we define we can write Eq. (5.67b) in terms of u as 2 2Ti2 L 1\"/2 (p2) = ~3 2 -; 0 cos 2 udu. A trip to the nearest integral table yields (5.69) (5.70) (5.71) And, using this integral in (5.70) and taking the square root of the result, as prescribed by (5.65), we find the momentum uncertainty t!!..p = 1fTi L (ground state of infinite square well). (5.72) Since t!!..p > 0, the momentum of particles in the ground state is not sharp. So in an ensemble measurement, various members yield different values of p. These values are distributed about the mean momentum for this state, (P) = o. Example 5.6. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle-Verified. With very little additional work, we can for the first time test the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. According to this fundamental tenet of quantum physics. the product of the position and momentum uncertainties for any quantum state of any system must be greater than or equal to Ti/2. We just evaluated t!!..p for a particular quantum state of a particular system: the ground state of the infinite square well. So let's evaluate t!!..x for this state and thence the uncertainty product. The position uncertainty is no more difficult to evaluate than was the momentum uncertainty. From the form of the wave function (5.22) we see that in the region where it's non-zero (inside the \"box\" ) this function is a simple cosine . This function is symmetric about x = 0, so the expectation value of position in this state is zero: (5.73) Question 5-7 Argue from the fact that the probability density IIII 1(x, oW is symmetric and from the physical meaning of (x) that this quantity must be zero. Now carry out the integral in (5.73) explicitly and prove that your argument is correct. Sec . 5.6 Generalizing Our Expectations (and Uncertainties) 167 This being the case, the position uncertainty simplifies to ~x = J(:ii). So all we need do now is evaluate the mean value of X 2, (5.74) (5.75) A second implementation of integration by parts [a III Eq. (5.69)] yields (x 2 ) = 0.0327 L2 , whence the position uncertainty is ~x = 0.1808 L, Question 5-8 Fill in the steps leading to Eq. (5.76). Now we can evaluate the uncertainty product: ~x ~p = 0.57h. (5.76) (5.77) Sure enough. for the ground state of the infinite square well, this product is greater than 0.5h. which verifies the prediction of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In practice. we don't often bother to substantiate this principle (which we'll prove in Chap. 11). But a verification like Eq. (5.77) is a good way to check your algebra in the evaluation of uncertainties. Consider this a hint. Aside: A Discouraging Word about Uncertainties. Evaluating uncertainties for observables other than position and momentum usually involves pretty formidable algebra. Suppose, for example. that you want to evaluate the mean value of the energy of a particle in the infinite square well, (5.78) To be sure,formally this task poses no problems. The two expectation values are just (E) =I:1JtÂ· (x , t) 1tlJt(x, t) dx (E 2 ) =I:1JtÂ· (x , t)\":Â£2 lJt(x, t) dx. (5.79a) (5.79b) Inside the box V = 0, so the Hamiltonian simplifies to the kinetic energy operator T. Since the wave function is zero outside the box, these expectation values are just the finite integrals l L / 2 (E)(t) = 1JtÂ· (x , t)TIJt(x, t) dx -L/2 l L / 2 (E 2 ) (t) = 1JtÂ· (x, t)T21Jt(x, t) dx. -L/2 168 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics But look at these integrals. The expectation value doesn't look too bad: j L/ 2 - 2 (E)(t) = w'(x,t) f-W(x , t) dx - L/ 2 m j L/ 2 . (1i,2 82 ) = - L/ 2 W (x, t) - 2m 8 x 2 w(x, t) dx . But to calculate the uncertainty 6E we must evaluate (E2) = i~/:w'(x,t) (4~2P4)w(x,t)dx. For most wave functions, evaluating jJ4 w(x, t), if possible at all, is quite arduous- it's certainly not the sort of thing you would want to do unless you absolutely had to. Yet, all is not lost. There are many ways to skin the proverbial cat.!\" In Part IV we'll develop diverse strategies for evaluating expectation values and uncertainties, strategies that are more clever (and much easier) than brute force application of the equations in this section. 5.7 OPERATORS AND THE CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLE One of the most curious things about the operators that represent observables in quantum mechanics is that they seem to have no clear physical relationship to the functions of time that represent observables in classical physics. To be sure, there is a formal relationship between the two: the operator Qthat represents an observable Q is related to the classical function Q[x(t),p(t)] = Q(x,p) via the replacements - d - ' 10 () X ~ X = x an p ~ p = -~n()x' Still, we intuitively suspect that if, as we required in Chap. I, quantum physics is to be consistent with classical physics, then when applied to a state of a macroscopic system, the operator Q should behave like the function Q(t). This consistency requirement is the essence of the Correspondence Principle (see Â§ 1.2): Rule The Correspondence Principle: In the classical limit, the laws of quantum mechanics must reduce to those of Newtonian Mechanics. But precisely how does this principle work, in practice? That is, what is the nature of the physical correspondence between the quantum mechanical operator Q and the classical function Q(t)? Well, here 's an example: if we compute the value at time t of the property Q for a macroscopic system from the operator Q and from the function Q(t), we should get the same number to within any measurable accuracy. (Remember that the statements of quantum physics are limited to what can be measured in the lab.) In order to see if this consistency requirement is satisfied, we must look closely at the meaning of such evaluations-and that is the thrust of this section. 19Cal lovers: please don't write letters, This is a metaphor. I love cats. Sec. 5.7 Operators and the Correspondence Principle 169 The Classical Limit-And How to Get There The key phrase in the statement of the Correspondence Principle is \"the classical limit.\" You probably have a feeling for what this phrase means: an electron is not a classical system; a racquetball is. But to understand the relationship between classical and quantum physics, you need to understand the precise meaning of this limit. Many quantum mechanics texts define the classical limit in a way that, to new- comers, often sounds absurd. Consider, for example, the following statement of the Correspondence Principler''' \"In the limit where 1i -+ 0, the laws of Quantum Mechan- ics must reduce to those of Classical Mechanics.\" Think about this statement. What could it possibly mean? We know that 1i is an immutable fundamental constant of nature; its value isn't zero, it's 1.0546 x 10-34 I-sec. (If 1i were zero, this book, its author, and its readers would not exist.) The statement of the classical limit as \"the limit in which 1i -+ 0\" is not wrong; it's just a little terse. To understand it, we must recall the limitation of quantum physics to measurable phenomena. That is, quantum effects-which follow from the fact that 1i t:- O-are of no significance unless they can be measured. So what the quoted state- ment really means is the classical limit is the limit in which all quantum effects are immeasurably small. Example 5.7. The Classical Limit and Uncertainties To illustrate this essential idea, let's ponder an aspect of quantum theory that is blatantly non-elassical: the limitations on knowledge we see reflected in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ~x ~p 2: n/2. I want to apply this principle to an ensemble of macroscopic systems, to show you that for such systems, quantum mechanical uncertainties are not measurable and hence are irrelevant-i.e., in this sense, a macroscopic system behaves according to our classical expectations. Suppose we want to simultaneously measure the position and velocity of an ensemble of identical particles of mass m . Whether the particles are microscopic or macroscopic, these measurements are subjectto the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles. To conveniently express this restriction, I'll define a velocity uncertainty as and write the uncertainty principle as 1 n ~x~v > - - .-2m (5.80) (5.81) Now, suppose the particles are macroscopic, say, racquetballs with m = 0.1 kg. This large mass makes the product (5.81) very small, (5.82) True, it's non-zero-but we can't verify this fact experimentally. So for all practical (i.e.â€¢ experimental) purposes, the uncertainty product is zero: [for macroscopic particles] . (5.83) 20From Quantum Mechanics by Albert Messiah (New York: Wiley, 1966). p. 214. 170 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics The point of this example is that although the uncertainty principles of quantum mechanics do apply to macroscopic particles . they in no way limit the accuracy of a measurement of position and velocity. The demonstration in Example 5.7 can be put on a more rigorous footing by writing down a wave packet that represents a state of the particles in the ensemble and calculating from this function the uncertainties ~x and ~p. One finds that the individual uncertainties ~x and ~p are negligibly small, i.e.,21 ~x~O and ~p~O [for macroscopic particles]. (5.84) Equation (5.84) makes perfect sense. At any time, a macroscopic particle has a well-defined value of x and of p, so we should be able to measure these observables to any desired precision (allowing for experimental inaccuracy). In the language of quantum physics, this implies that quantum indeterminacies ~x and ~p should be immeasurably small. As they are. Stat/st/cal Quant/ties in the Classical Limit We've seen that in the classical limit, quantum mechanical uncertainties become negli- gible. I want Â·you to think for a moment about the following question : what should the expectation value (Q) of an observable Q reduce to in this limit? *** Pause while reader ponders *** A clue to the answer is to be found in the definition of (Q). Remember-that, like the uncertainty, the expectation value is a statistical quantity; i.e., it describes the results of an ensemble measurement-a series of identical measurements performed, at the same time t, on identical systems in the same state. If the state can be described by classical physics, all members of the ensemble exhibit the same result (ignoring, for the moment, experimental error): the value of the function Q(t) at the measurement time. (That's why the standard deviation of these results, ~Q, is zero.) So the average of these results, the expectation value (Q), is Q(t). We conclude that in the classical limit, (Q) (t) should become equal, to any measurable accuracy, to Q(t). Aside: The Classical Limit of a Microscopic System. I don't want to leave you with the impression that \"the classical limit\" is limited to macroscopic particles. For some microscopic systems, all quantum mechanical uncertainties are immeasurably small for certain states. These particular states, therefore, behave according to the laws of classical physics. For example, highly energetic states of a microscopic simple harmonic oscillator behave in this fashion, because (Chap. 9) for such states all quantum effects are too small to be measured. The point is that the classical limit may pertain either to all states of a macroscopic system or to certain states of a microscopic system . We have discovered an extremely important key to how the Correspondence Prin- ciple works: 21 For details. see Â§ 12-7 of Elementary Quantum Mechanics by P. Fong (Reading. Mass: Addison- Wesley, 1960) and Chap. 8 of Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by R. H. Dicke and J. P. Wittke (Reading. Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1960). Sec. 5.7 Operators and the Correspondence Principle 171 Rule The element of quantum theory that in the classical limit corresponds to the classical function Q(t) is the expectation value of the operator Qwith respect to the wave function I}/(x, t) that represents the state. That is, we get from the slate functions of quantum mechanics to the classical limit via the statistical quantities (Q) and ti.Q: The Rules of the Game (Q)(t) 1 Q(t) the clas sical limit ti.Q(t) , 0 the classi cal lim it (5.85) In this chapter, we've explored the elements of quantum theory that represent physical properties, operators, and how they are related to the corresponding elements of classical theory , functions of time. What we have not investigated are the laws we construct from these elements. But the Correspondence Principle demands that the laws of quantum physics reduce to those of classical physics in the classical limit. How, you may be wondering, does this work? Here's a preview of a result we'll prove in Chap. 11. Once we have studied the time dependence of state functions and expectation values, we'll easily verify that (p) and (x) obey the provocatively familiar equation d (P) = m- (x). dt (5.800) You can probably see already what this equation translates into when we take the classical limit. In this limit, the expectation values in (5.800) behave according to Eq. (5.85), i.e., (x) (t) --------+ 1 x (t ) the clas sica l lim it (p) (t) -----+, p(t) . the clas sical limit (5.86b) (5.86c) So the quantum mechanical law (5.800) reduces (to within the accuracy of any measure- ment) to the familiar equation d d (P) = m dt (x) 1 p(t ) = m - X(t). th e clas sical limi t dt Isn't that satisfying? (5.87) 172 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics 5.8 FINAL THOUGHTS: OPERATORS IN MOMENTUM SPACE Let's review the situation, Solve the complicated plot. Quiet calm deliberation Disentangles every knot. -from The Gondoliers by Gilbert and Sullivan With this chapter, we've devised ways to represent the two essential elements of physical theory: states and observables. And we've begun assembling a dictionary of the \"property descriptors\" of quantum physics: observables (see Table 5.2). TABLE 5.2 A PARTIAL DICTIONARY FOR OBSERVABLES AND CORRESPONDING OPERATORS Observable Operator Instructions position x multiply by x momentum p \"h 8-t - 8x Hamiltonian if. T+V kinetic energy T h2 82 - 2m 8x2 potential energy V multiply by V(x , t) In the examples of this chapter, we used operators to evaluate expectation values and uncertainties . But operators tell us far more than just the values of statistical quanti- ties. In Chap. II, we'll examine the eigenvalues of an operator. In quantum mechanics, these numbers have a profound, startling physical significance: the eigenvalues of an operator are the only values that can be obtained in a measurement of the observable that operator represents . Nothing remotely like this occurs in classical physics. The systems we've investigated have consisted of a single particle in one dimension, so I wrote the operators in Table 5.2 in terms of the position variable x. But we can generalize all of them to more complicated systems. For instance, the kinetic-energy operator for a single particle in three dimensions is t = 2~(p; + p~+ p~) (5.88a) =.s:;. (5.88b) 2m h2 ( 82 82 82 ) = - 2m 8x 2 + 8 y2 + 8 z2 â€¢ (5.88c) The position variables z, y, and z appear explicitly in Eq. (5.88c), which we therefore call \"the kinetic energy operator in the position representation.\" But the position representation is but one of a multitude of \"representations\" used in quantum mechanics. The idea of alternative representations of the elements of quantum Sec. 5.8 Final Thoughts : Operators in Momentum Space 173 theory is not new: in Â§ 4.8, I remarked that the position probability amplitude W(x,0) is but one of many ways to represent a state at t = O. Another, entirely equivalent descriptor for this state is the momentum probability amplitude cp(p). We call this function the wave function in the momentum representation. As you'll discover in your next course in quantum mechanics, the various rep- resentations of a state we use are actually explicit functional forms of a more abstract entity called a state vector. This beast, which I've mentioned before, lives in an abstract vector space called a Hilbert space. Similarly, you'll meet operators in Hilbert space, where they too have an abstract form. . Operators, like state descriptors, can be written in a variety of representations. In this chapter, we've worked exclusively in the position representation, where x is the independent variable. In this representation the operators for position and momentum have the form x = x â€¢ 'h ap = -t - ax [position representation]. (5.89) (5.91a) (5.91b) In the momentum representation, where p is the independent variable, these operators look like (see Pblm. 5.6) x = ih ~ P = p [momentum representation]. (5.90) ap In the momentum representation, these operators act on functions of momentum- the momentum probability amplitudes CP(p)-not on functions of x. For example, we evaluate the expectation value of position at t = 0 from cp(p) as (x) (0) = 1:CP*(p) xcp(p) dp = 1:CP*(p) (ih ~)CP(p) dp. All representations are equivalent, in the sense that they all lead to the same physical information about states and properties. The choice of representation is up to you. But you needn't be concerned about this choice now; except for these occasional end-of-the-chapter rambles, I'll work in the position representation. There is, after all, lots left to do in this representation. For example, we've got to figure out how to describe the evolution of a quantum state. On to Chap. 6. ANNOTATED SELECTED READINGS Operator Mathematics Several useful texts on the mathematical properties of operators are available. Most of the topics covered in these books are somewhat advanced, and we won't get to them until Chap. to. Nonetheless, here they are. My personal favorite-and an excellent investment at the price-is I. Jackson, J. D., Mathematics for Quantum Mechanics (New York: W. A. Benjamin, Inc., 1962) (available in paperback). See especially Â§ 4.2. A useful book at a more advanced level is 174 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics 2. Jordan, Thomas F., Linear Operators/or Quantum Mechanics (New York: Wiley, 1969). Chap. II contains an introduction to operators, and Chap. IV discusses advanced features of operator algebra. In addition to these books, most texts on mathematical methods for physicists include discussions of basic operator mathematics, and nearly any undergraduate quan- tum mechanics text includes bushels of exercises involving operators. Of the latter, I particularly recommend 3. Gillespie, Daniel T., A Quantum Mechanics Primer (New York: Intext, 1970), Chap. 2. And, for general insight into operators and their role in quantum mechanics, you can't do better than 4. Dirac, P. A. M., The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, 4th ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958), Chap. 2. EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS The tasks of filling in the blanks I'd rather leave to you. -The Mikado, in The Mikado by Gilbert and Sullivan Most of the problems for this chapter exercise your ability to manipulate operators. But Pblm. 5.2 shows you a path to the all-important momentum operator that is different from the one I used in Â§ 5.2. And Pblm. 5.3, which you should at least read, reveals a subtle difficulty that can infect the process of generating operators using the prescription in Â§ 5.3. Finally, the last several explore the momentum representation of operators.

Exercises and Problems 175 Problems 5.1 A \"Derivation\" of the Momentum Operator One way to deduce the form of the momentum operator jJ is to work from the necessary correspondence between expectation values and classical observables. Suppose, as in Â§ 5.2, we seek an expression for the mean value of the momentum, (P). Reasoning by analogy with our expression for (x), we could use P(x, t) as a weighting factor and write (P) =1:pP(x, t) dx =1:pil!. (x , t)il!(x, t) dx. (5.1.1) (5.1.2) To use this result, we need to express pil!. (x, t)il!(x, t) as a function of x. Let's begin with Eq. (5.86), which I'll ask you to take on faith: d (p)=mdt(x) .

[cJ Repeat the derivation of the momentum operator starting from the expression (5.1.4a) for the expectation value. Use integration by parts and the Dirac delta function . 5.2 A Correspondence Conundrum (Symmetrization) The expectation value (Q) of an observable Q can be measured in the laboratory-it is just the mean value obtained in an ensemble measurement of Q. This quantity, therefore , must be real. This fact of nature has interesting implications for the generation of quantum mechanical observables, as we shall now see. Suppose we need to evaluate the mean value of the product of position and momentum. The observable in question is xp, and, in classical physics, it makes no difference whether we represent this observable by x(t)p(t) or by p(t)x(t). In quantum physics we have a choice of two operators: xjJ or jJ x, and it does make a difference. You can see why by writing down expressions for the mean value of xp for a state represented by a wave function il!(x, t) using these two operators. In the first instance, the mean value of xp is (xp) =1:il!. (x , t)x ( -in. :x) il!(x , t) dx, but in the second, it's (px) =1:il!Â·(x,t) (-in.:x) xil!(x,t)dx . (5.2.1) (5.2.2) 176 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics (5.2.3) [al Show that neither xp nor px is an acceptable operator representation of the observable xp, because both violate the requirement that the expectation value of a physically measurable quantity must be real.

Why do we need the factor of 1/2 in this expres- sion? What, if anything, does your answer have to do with the Correspondence Principle? Remark: This problem illustrates a difficulty that occasionally crops up in determining oper- ators from classical functions of time. If two operators Ql and Q2 do not commute , i.e., if QIQ2 :f. Q2QIo then there is an ambiguity in the operator that represents QIQ2: should we use QI Q2 or Q2QI? The answer, as you saw in this problem, is neither. In Chap. 10 we'll leam why both of these forms fail: all quantum mechanical operators must satisfy a property called Hermiticity. Neither QI Q2 nor Q2QI satisfies this property, so neither can be used in quantum mechanics . However, the combination (5.2.3) is Hermitian and is the correct oper- ator representation of the observable xp. In quantum mechanics, the process of constructing an observable for a product of two non-commuting observables is called symmetrization. 5.3 Probing the General Properties of Wave Packets In Chap. 4, we considered specific wave packets that could represent states of the free panicle at t = O. All of these functions have the same mathematical structure: \\lI(x,O) = f(x) eiPox/1i, where f(x) is a real, relatively smooth function of x . For convenience let's suppose that \\lI(x,O) has been properly normalized and that f(x) is centered at x = 0 with width ~x. Examining the properties of this general form is useful, since a huge number of commonly-- used wave packets can be described in this way-with appropriate choice of f(x), of course. [a] Evaluate the expectation value of p for this wave packet. Hint : The normalization requirement on the state function means that 1\\lI(x, 0)1 -> 0 as x -> Â±oo. Consider integration by parts. [b] Now, consider a free-particle state function that is real at t = O. What is (P) for a state represented by such a function? Is the mean value of the kinetic energy, (T), necessarily equal to zero for such a state? Is (x) necessarily equal to zero for such a state? If not, under what conditions on the real wave function \\lI(x, 0) is (x) = O? [c] Consider the amplitude function A(k) for a general wave function that is real at t = O. Under what condition on this wave function is A(k) a real function of k? Suppose this condition is met; what is (x) for a state that is represented by such a function? 5.4 Practicing Operator Algebra In this chapter, we've formulated a prescription for determining the operator that represents an observable in quantum mechanics starting with the classical function of x and p that represents it in classical theory. We usually derive these operators in the position representation; but, as I noted in Â§ 5.8, we can do so in the momentum representat ion. Although we won't use the momentum representation extensively in this book, we shall work with it in this problem in order to obtain some practice with operator algebra . [a] Write down the operators in the position and momentum representations for each of the following observables of the specified one-dimensional systems : (l) the kinetic energy of a free particle; (2) the potential energy of a particle in a gravitational field V(x) = mgx; (3) the potential energy of a particle with a simple harmonic oscillator potential energy. [b] In classical physics, the total energy E of a conservative system (i.e ., one whose potential energy does not depend on time) is related to the Hamiltonian by Exercises and Problems 1n H(x,p) - E = 0 [for a conservative system] This is just the classical expression of the law of conservation of energy. Consider a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator. Write down the operator equivalents of this equation in the position and momentum representation. Let your equations operate on ll1(x, t) or cfl(P) as appropriate. 5.5 The Position Operator in the Momentum Representation Let ll1(x,O) denote an arbitrary free-particle state function at t = O. Starting from the expression (5.11) for the position expectation value, and using the Fourier transform relations of Chap. 4 to zip back and forth between the position and momentum representations, derive Eq. (5.90) for the position operator in the momentum representation. 5.6 How to Choose a Representation NOTE: This problem uses results from Pblm. 4.6. In Â§ 5.8, I noted that quantum mechanical operators can be written in a variety of different representations. For example, Eqs. (5.89) give the operators :i; and p in the position rep- resentation; Eqs. (5.90) give these operators in the momentum representation. Position and momentum operators are the fundamental observables of physics, so once we know :i; and p in a given representation, we can work out the form of any observable in that representation. For example, the form of the kinetic energy operator t for a single particle in one dimension in the position representation is developed in Example 5.3 [see Eq. (5.49)]. In the momentum representation, the operator p instructs us to simply multiply its operand by p. Hence the kinetic energy operator in the momentum representation is simpler than in the position representation: Â· 2 { A P T = 2m = \",2 8 2 - 2m 8x 2 L 2m position representation; momentum representation (5.6.1) Comparing these forms, you might guess that it's easier to evaluate expressions that include t in the momentum representation, where this operator calls for a simple multiplication, than in the position representation, where it requires evaluating a second derivative. Let's see if this is true. Suppose we want to evaluate the expectation value (T)\" (0) of the kinetic energy at t = 0 for the nth stationary state of the infinite square well of Example 5.1. We can use the momentum probability amplitude cfl,,(p) from Problem (4.6) to determine this quantity in the momentum representation. [a] Write down expressions for (T)\" (0) in the position and momentum representations. In each case, write down an explicit integral, inserting the appropriate amplitude functions and carefully indicating the limits of integration, but do not evaluate the integrals. [b] Choose one of your expressions in part [a] and evaluate (T)\" (0). (One of your expres- sions is much easier to evaluate than the other. Obviously, I want you to choose the easiest of the two expressions.) [c] Repeat parts [a] and [b] for the uncertainty in the kinetic energy, (~T),,(O). 5.7 Efficient Evaluation of Expectation Values We can evaluate the expectation value of position (x) in either the position representation [a Iii Eq. (3.4Oa)] or in the momentum representation [a Iii Eq. (5.9Ib)]. Almost invariably, one representation is to be preferred over the other-if for no other reason than that the required algebra is easier in one representation. Therefore, it is useful to consider the conditions under which the position or momentum representation of this quantity is preferable. [a] Consider a Gaussian wave packet Eq. (4.54) centered on x = 0 (see Â§ 4.5). Evaluate (x) (t) and (P) (t) for this wave packet in the position representation. 178 Chap. 5 Observables in Quantum Physics [b) Evaluate (x) (t) and (P) (t) for a Gaussian wave packet in the momentum representation (see Question 4-12). [c] The wave function of a square wave packet is -00 < x < L, -L s x s Lj L < x < 00 . Write down explicit expressions for (x) and (P) in terms of this wave function (but don't evaluate the integrals yet). [d) Derive an expression for the momentum probability amplitude <I>(p) for the square wave packet. Using your function, write down expressions for (x) and (P) in terms of the momentum probability amplitude. [e) Examine your expressions for (x) and (P) from parts [c) and [d). Choose the easiest expression for each expectation value and evaluate the necessary integrals to determine the mean values of position and momentum for the square wave packet.

You're everything you ought to be, and nothing that you oughtn't O! -Melissa, in Princess Ida by Gilbert and Sullivan We all know intuitively what we mean by motion. Motion is change, evolution, develop- ment. A dove soars across a turquoise noon-day sky; a meteor plunges earthward from the night-black heavens; a train derails and falls off a bridge, plummeting to the jagged rocks below. The world is alive with motion. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that physics is the study of motion. Physicists spend much of their lives studying the evolution of physical systems: how the properties of these systems change with time. In classical physics, too, we know what we mean by motion. To study the motion of, say, a single macroscopic particle, we solve Newton's Second Law for the particle's orbit r(t) for all times after some initial time to. Once we know the orbit, we can calculate other physical properties of the particle. So, in principle at least, we can fully describe the evolution of a state of the particle provided we know the potential V(r , t) that describes the forces acting on it and the initial conditions r( to) and v(to) that specify the state. Of course, we must also be able to solve the equations of motion. This mathematical and numerical task is no picnic-and therein lies the principle difficulty of classical physics. An additional problem rears its head in the study of microscopic systems, for we must answer the subtle conceptual question, what does it mean to speak of the motion of a microscopic particle? This conundrum arises because of a feature of microscopic particles that we discussed in Chap. 5: such a particle does not have a position until we measure this observable. That is, the conceptual difficulty with motion in quantum mechanics derives from the latent character of the particle-like properties of microscopic particles. In quantum physics we describe observables and their evolution in the language of probabilities. We have already discovered (Chap. 3) that knowledge about the position of microscopic particles (in an ensemble) is represented by the probability density for their quantum state, P(x, t ) = w*(x, t)W(x, t), and by such statistical quantities as the expectation value (x). So it should come as no surprise that we talk about the motion of such particles in probabilistic terms. So the very nature of knowledge in quantum physics gives rise to an unusual, counter-intuitive notion of motion that is difficult to picture. So physicists call on pic- torial analogies based on their (macroscopic) experience. For example, one way to envision motion in the microworld is as the propagation--or jlow--of a region of en- hanced position probability. This peculiar idea is illustrated in Fig. 6.1; we'll explore it in detail later in this chapter. But beware: these analogies are seductive. They can lead you down a garden path to impure classical thoughts. So, as you contemplate Fig. 6.1, keep in mind the caveats of Chap. 3 concerning the meaning of the probability density. For example, each of the density functions shown in this figure has a finite spread (or width); but this does not imply that the corresponding particles are of finite size. The particles whose state these functions represent are, in our model, indivisible mass-points, 181 without dimension or internal structure. Rather, the finite spread in Fig. 6.1 means that the positions of these particles cannot be known precisely-i.e., they 're not meaningfully defined in the absence of measurement. PIx, '0'1 1\\ Time: to â€¢x PIx, \"'I Time: t, ~ â€¢x PIx, \"'1 Time: t2 ~ ~ â€¢x Figure 6.1 Snapshotsof a one-dimensional wave packetat three times. The propagation and spreading illustrated here will be explored in Â§ 6.6 and 6.7. You also need to remember that neither the wave function nor the probability density exists in ordinary, geometrical space. A probability density P(x, t) is information incarnate: it speaks to the likelihood of obtaining one of a variety of possible results in a position measurement. As the particles in an ensemble move through space, their wave function w(x , t) evolves with time; consequently P(x, t) changes, and so does the (probabilistic) position information it contains. Thus in quantum physics, the \"motion of a particle\" is described by the evolution of the state function, which is interpreted at each time from the position probability density. We begin our exploration of quantum motion by familiarizing ourselves with the equation that describes the time development of state functions: the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (3.39) (Â§ 6.1 and 6.2). We're going to spend most of the rest of this book tracking down solutions of this important equation, so we'll take the time here to get to know it well. The \"personality\" of the Schrodinger equation is defined by its mathematical characteristics, which we'll scrutinize in Â§ 6.3-6.4. Then, in Â§ 6.7, we'll meet our paradigm of quantum motion: the propagation of a free-particle wave packet. A final note: Left to its own devices, a quantum state changes with time ac- cording to the Schrodinger equation. But a measurement also alters a quantum state, in an indeterminate way that is not described by this equation. We'll learn how to treat measurement-induced changes of state in Chap. 13. But here we'll consider only unobserved particles. No measurements allowed. 182 Chap . 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion 6.1 WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MOTION In Newtonian mechanics , we study the evolution of the state descriptor of a particle-its trajectory-by solving the classical equation of motion, Newton 's Second Law (5.5). Similarly , to study the evolution of the quantum state descriptor-the state function-we need a \"quantum equation of motion.\" In 1926 the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger (1887-1961 ) published such an equation. Schrodinger was an extraordinary scientist and gifted thinker who contributed to fields as diverse as psychology and biology. He also wrote lucidly on quantum physics for both technical and lay readers .1 But Schrodinger's greatest contribution was undoubtedly the equation that bears his name: the time-dependent Schriidinger Equation (TDSE), [Eq. (3.39)], n 2 8 2 8 - 2m ax2 w (x , t) + V (x)w(x, t) = inat w(x , t) . (6.1) This equation fully describes the evolution of the quantum states of a system-if, that is, no one sneaks into the lab and performs a measurement on it. Although the TDSE was not-indeed, cannot be-derived, neither did it spring from empty space into Schrodinger's mind.2 In the 1920's, Schrodinger came to the study of -the then nascent quantum theory via research in statistical mechanics and the physics of continuous media, work that inculcated in him a thorough understanding of the mathematics and physics of vibrations and waves. Stimulated by a 1925 paper by Einstein on the quantum theory of an ideal gas, Schrodinger erected his theory on the foundation of de Broglie's matter waves (Chap. 2). Guided by geometrical and wave optics, Schrodinger generalized a fundamental equation of classical mechanics, the Hamilton equation, to formulate his wave theory of microscopic particles.P The road we'll follow to the TDSE is more direct than the one Schrodinger trav- elled. Our first step on this road is to find an operator to represent energy, which we'll do using a strategy we devised in Chap. 5. The Energy Operator In Â§ 5.3 we sought an operator p that represents the observable momentum. Our game plan was to find an operator that, when applied to a pure momentum function with momentum p and energy E, = _1_ e i(px-Et )/h J21rn ' (6.2) 1Readers interested in pursuing some of Schrodinger's best technical writings should seek out his Four Lectures on Wave Mechanics (London: Blackie and Sons, 1928). Noteworthy among his non-technical works are My View of the World (London: Cambridge University Press, 1964) and Scien ce and Humanism (London: Cambridge University Press, 1951). A particularly good biography is William T. Scott's Erwin Schroedinger (Amherst: University of Mass. Press, 1967). 2y ou can find a fascinating account of the genesis of the TDSE-and of Schrodinger's other trail- blazing research in quantum theory-in Chap. 5 of The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechani cs by Max Jammer (New York: McGraw-Hili, 1966). But you'll have to look for this book in a library rather than a bookstore; it has, inexcusably, been allowed to go out of print. 3Hamilton's equation looks a bit like the TDSE. It is written in terms of a quantity called the action function that is usually denoted by W. The action function is the integral of T - V along a path of the system, and Hamilton's equation has the form - 8 W/8t = T+ V . For more on the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, see Chap. 7 of Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems by Jerry B. Marion (New York: Academic Press, 1970). Sec. 6.1 What We Talk About When We Talk About Motion 183 would yield the value of the momentum, i.e., (6.3) We then postulated (Postulate III) that this operator could be used to extract momentum information from all quantum states: . .~ a P = -u'ax' (6.4) We now need an energy operator Ethat extracts information concerning the energy. So let's find an operator that, when applied to a pure momentum function, yields the value of the energy, i.e., (6.5a) The appearance of this value in the exponential in (6.2), where it's on a par with the momentum, suggests that, as in (6.4), we should differentiate. But in this exponential, E multiplies t. So we differentiate with respect to time, viz., From (6.5a) we can easily isolate the operator that satisfies (6.5a): (6.5b) energy operator (6.6) Question 6-1 Use this operator to extract the value of the energy from the pure momentum function (5.15). Still following the approach of Chap. 5, we now hypothesize that we can identify this operator with the energy of an arbitrary quantum state. This supposition establishes the correspondence QUANTUM PHYSICS OBSERVABLE energy The Energy Equation <=> OPERATOR E (6.7) Using the energy operator, we can translate classical equations containing the observable energy into their quantum-mechanical counterparts. The most fundamental of these equations is (Â§ 5.4) the equality of E and the classical Hamiltonian, 184 Chap. 6 E=H. A Quantum Equation Of Motion (6.8) By definition H (for a single particle in one dimension) is4 H(x,p) = T(p) + V(x, t) p2 = 2m + V(x, t). The quantum-mechanical counterpart of Eq. (6.8) is the operator equation (6.9) (6.10) (6.11) To obtain an explicit form of this equation for a particular system, we just replace the abstract operators in it with the appropriate instructions. For example, using Table 5.2 and Eq. (6.6), we find that in the position representation the Hamiltonian operator (6.10) is . Ii? 82 'H. = - 2m 8x 2 + V(x, t) . So the quantum-mechanical energy equation (6.11) IS (6.12) (6.13) 8 n 2 82 in8t = - 2m 8x 2 + V(x, t). This is the operator form of the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation. To get the form (6.1) of this equation, we just let its operators act on an arbitrary wave function W(x, t), viz., TDSE (6.14) This omnipresent equation is often written in a shorthand form, such as or, by people who really want to conserve pencils, as 1lW(x, t) = EW(x, t) . I don't care how you write the Schrodinger equation, but commitit to memory. The Fundamental Postulate of Quantum Dynamics (6.15a) (6. 15b) Note carefully that I did not derive the TDSE. Like the operator identifications in it, this equation is one of our fundamental postulates. More precisely, the fourth postulate of quantum physics avers that the TDSE describes the evolution of any state of any quantum system: 4The potential energy V may depend on time-as it does. for example, for a particle in a time- dependent electromagnetic field. For most of this volume, however, we shall concentrate on systems with time-independent potentials-so-called conservative systems. (See Chap. 7.) Sec. 6.1 What We Talk About When We Talk About Motion 185 The Fourth Postulate of QlUlntum Mechonics The time development of the state functions of an isolated quantum system is governed by the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation itiJ! = iii:tiJ!, where it = T + V is the Hamiltonian of the system. Notice carefully the word isolated in this postulate-which serves to remind us that the TDSE describes the evolution of a state provided no observations are made. An observation (usually) alters the state of the observed system; and, versatile as it is, the TDSE cannot describe such changes.' . The role of the TDSE in problem solving is paramount: once we know the Hamilto- nian il of a system, we can use this equation to discover the space- and time-dependence of its state functions. In this chapter we'll probe the time dependence of these functions; in Chap. 7, we'll investigate their spatial dependence. Aside: On Wave Equations. Schrodinger initially referred to his theory by the slightly repellent name undulatory mechanics , which he later changed to wave me- chanics. So the TDSE is often called the wave equation of quantum mechanics. But I won't use this colorful language, lest it mislead you into imagining that the state function is a wave in ordinary, geometrical space, like an electromagnetic wave. Strictly speaking, the TDSE does fall into the mathematical class of equations called wave equations . But it differs in form from the classical wave equations that we use to describe oscilIations on a string, electromagnetic fields, and the like. For a three-dimensional wave I'(r, t) with phase velocity Vph, the classical equation of propagation is 2 1 (p V I'[r, t) = - \"'2 I'(r, t) . Vph U~ Unlike the TDSE, this equation is second order in time. There are other classical wave equations, however, that are first-order in time, such as the classical heat equation; but unlike the TDSE, these equations do not require a complex solution. [For more on classical wave equations, see The Physics of Waves by W. C. Elmore and M. A. Heald (New York: McGraw-HilI, 1969).] The TDSE in 3D Our immediate applications of Schrodinger's theory will be to simple systems in one dimension, so we'll use Eq. (6.14). But it's easy to generalize this equation to a single particle in three dimensions or to a many-particle system. For the former system, the state function is \\l1(r, t) and the Hamiltonian operator is - 11? 2 'H = - 2m V + V(r, t). [single particle in three dimensions] (6.16) In this operator, the Laplacian V 2 in rectangular coordinates is 82 82 8 2 V 2 = 8x2 + 8 y2 + 8z2' (6.17) 5But not all measurements induce a change of state. For example, an energy measurement on an ensemble in a state with a well-defined energy won't change the state of the members. This is, however, a very special case. The point to retain is that in general, a measurement induces an instantaneous, uncontrollable change of state. 186 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion So the TDSE for a single particle in three dimensions is h2 a - 2m yr2w(r ,t) + V(r, t)W(r,t) = ih at w(r, t) . (6.18) The Hamiltonian of a many-particle system-say, an atom-s-contains kinetic and potential energy operators for each constituent particle and interaction potentials for all pairs of particles; we shall meet and subdue this monster in Volume II. Even in one dimension, the TDSE in all its glory may appear rather fearsome: all those ominous partial derivatives, and an i = A lurking, menacingly, on the right-hand side. But it's just another partial differential equation. And mathematicians, numerical analysts, and theoretical physicists have spent decades devising schemes to solve such equations. The remaining chapters of this book are a guided tour through some of their best work. Getting Started: Initial Conditions For any Hamiltonian if. there exists an infinite number of mathematically valid solutions to the TDSE. This wealth of wave functions raises a question: how do we specify a particular solution-that special function which represents the state we're interested in? Evidently, the TDSE alone is not sufficient to identify a particular state; additional information is called for. For a clue to the missing information, let's look to the theory of differential equations .\" Peering at Eq. (6.14), we espy a second-order position derivative and afirst-order time derivative. These derivatives prescribe the additional information needed to specify a particular solution: The second-order partial with respect to x requires the values of w(x, t) at two positions x; these (complex) numbers are called boundary conditions. The first-order partial derivative with respect to t requires the wave function at a single time to, which we usually choose as to = O. This (complex)function is called the initial condition: {w(x , to): -00 < x < oo} initial condition (6.19) In this section we'll discuss initial conditions, leaving boundary conditions for Â§ 6.3. The idea of defining a state by feeding initial conditions to a differential equation is hardly new. In Newtonian mechanics, we solve a differential equation: Newton's Second Law, which for a single particle in one dimension with potential energy V(x, t) is d2 a m dt2x(t) = -axV(x,t) . (6.20) This differential equation is second order in time, so specifying a particular solution requires two pieces of information: the position and velocity (or, equivalently, the mo- mentum) at time to. 7 6To become a reasonably proficient quantum mechanic, you'll need a modicum of information about differential equations. Several worthwhile texts on this subject are recommended in this chapter's Selected Readings. You do not, however, need to understand the mathematical theory of partial differential equations; in the few instances where we must consider such equations, I'll provide the necessary mathematics. 7For convenience, physicists often prefer to define the initial state of a classical system by the position at two successive times, x( to) and x( tI) . Since the velocity is just the first derivative of position, knowing these two positions is equivalent to knowing x(to) and v(to), provided the difference tl - to is small. Sec. 6.1 What We Talk About When We Talk About Motion 187 So classical and quantum physics are alike in that both require the state descriptor at a single time. The difference between these theories is the kind of information they require: in classical physics , the real numbers of the trajectory {x(to),p(to)} at to; in quantum physics, the complex state function w(x, to) at to. In practice, we usually figure out the initial conditions from the physical circumstances of the system at to-e .g., from the wayan experiment is initially set up. We'll see a very simple example of this in Example 6.6. ' I've illustrated these differences schematically in Fig. 6.2 and summarized them below: CLASSICAL PHYSICS {x(to),p(to)} =* I Newton's Second Law I =* trajectory at t > to QUANTUM PHYSICS {1J1(x , to) : -00 < x < co} =* I TDSE I =* state function at t > to y Classical trajectory x (a) Re('It(x, toll (b) Figure 6.2 Initial conditions in (a) classical and (b) quantum physics. In (a) a macroscopic particle moves through a two-dimensional space along the trajectory shown. In (b) a microscopic particle in one dimension is represented by a (complex) state function IJ1(x , tll), the real part of which is sketched. The physical implications of these differences are profound indeed. For example, uncertainty is implicit in the evolution of a quantum state, for its initial condition is a function characterized by a non-zero position uncertainty, AX(to) > O. And this uncertainty Ax(t) increases as the state evolves (Â§ 6.7). No such indeterminacy plagues the classical description of motion. In Â§ 6.3, we'll examine other consequences of the mathematical form of the TDSE. But first: some examples. 188 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion 6.2 SATISFYING EXAMPLES And we are right, I think you'll say, To argue in this kind of way And I am right, And you are right, And all is right-too-looral-Iay!. -from The Mikado by Gilbert and Sullivan In Chaps. 3-5, I showed you several alleged state functions. But each of these functions is a valid state descriptor only if it satisfies the TDSE of its system. In this section, I want to tie up a couple of loose ends by demonstrating that two of the wave functions we've used most often, the free particle wave packet and the ground-state wave function of the infinite square well, are in fact legitimate. Example 6,1. The Ground State Wave Function of the Particle in a Box In two examples in Chap. 5 we calculated properties of the ground state of a particle of mass m whose potential was infinite everywhere except in a region of length L centered on x = O. This system is the particle in a box . In Example 5.1, we evaluated (P) and, in Example 5.5, t!.p for this state at t = O. In these examples I used (without proof) the wave function (6.21) [The label to the right of this function reminds us that it's zero everywhere except in the box-a condition that arises from the infinite potential at the walls (Â§ 7.4) .) This function is the t = 0 counterpart of the ground -state wave function, which we'll derive in Chap. 7. The time-dependence we'll discover there is a simple exponential involving t and the constant (6.22) This time-dependent wave function is ( ) f2 (X) -iElt/\" \\{II x,t = yicos 1r\"L e (6.23) The constant E I is the (well-defined) energy of this state. To check that the function (6.23) satisfies the roSE for this system, we need worry only about the region inside the box, for the state function is zero elsewhere. In this region V = 0, so if. = T, and the TDSE (6.14) is (6.24) Now we just insert \\{II (x, t) into each side of (6.24). The left-hand side of this equa- tion contains the second derivative of lit I (x, t), which we calculate from the first derivative !2( 1r) . ( X) -iElt/\"V\"L -\"L sm 1r\"L e (6.25) Sec. 6.2 Satisfying Examples 189 as (p a [a ] ax2 Wl(x,t) = ax ax Wl(X ,t) =II (-i) (i) cos ( 7ri ) e- iElt /h 7r2 = - pWl(X ,t) . So the left-hand side of (6.24) is 1i 2 & 7r2 1i 2 -2max 2 Wl(x,t) = 2mp Wl(x ,t). (6.200) (6.26b) (6.26c) (6.27) [Do you see a familiar factor on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.27)? If not, glance at Eq. (6.22), then look again.] Evaluating the right-hand side is even easier: we just differentiate Wl(x, t) once with respect to time:8 a iEl at Wl(X,t) = -TWl(x ,t). So the right-hand side of Eq. (6.24) is (6.28) (6.29) This expression is equal to 'HWl(X,t) in Eq. (6.27). The ground state function (6.23) does indeed solve the TDSE for the system. Postulate IV is satisfied. Return of the Free Particle (6.30)[for a free particle] In addition to the infinite square well, we've exhaustively examined the free particle of Chap. 4. The TDSE of this system is simply h2 8 2 8 - 2m 8x2 \\l1(x, t) = ih 8t \\l1(x, t) . In Â§ 4.1, I argued that a reasonable state function for a free particle in one dimension is a wave packet-a superposition of an infinite number of pure momentum functions that looks like \\l1(x, t) =i:~(p)\\l1p(x,t) dp. Although this packet is spatially localized (and hence norrnalizable) , it cannot represent a quantum state of a free particle unless it satisfies the roSE (6.30). I want to take you through this verification in two stages: first I'll show you that the pure momentum state functions that make up the packet satisfy this equation (Example 6.2). Then we'll tum to the packet itself (Example 6.3). 8you can see now why I used the full z- and t-dependent form of the proposed function in the TDSE. Had we tried to validate this function at a particular time, say, at t = 0, we'd have been unable to work out the time derivative in this equation. 190 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion Example 6.2. The Pure Momentum Function As presented in Chap. 4, the pure momentum function has the form . III (x t) = _1_ e i (pr-Et )/r. p, J21rn To make clear the derivation to follow, I want to write this function in terms of k. To this end, I'll use the free-particle dispersion relation to relate E to k: E=Jt....= 2m [for a free particle] (6.31) (6.32)[for a free particle] Inserting this relation into the general form of the pure momentum function gives a function that pertains only to the free particle, III (x t) = _1_ e i [kr - r.k 2 t / ( 2m Â»). p , J21rn The derivatives we need when we insert this function into the TDSE are\" (6.33a) (6.33b) and (6.34) (6.33c).!!.... e i [kr - r.k 2 t /( 2mÂ» ) = ink 2 .[kr-r.k 2t/(2mÂ» at - 2m e Now, the left-hand side of the TDSE is _n 2 j(2m) times (6.33b), . n2 k2 1illlp (x, t) = -llIp(x , t) . 2m The right-hand side is +in times (6.33c). which is equal to (6.34). This equality verifies the TDSE for the pure momentum function! Again, Postulate IV is happy. In Example 6.2, we've proven only that the pure momentum function for a free particle satisfies the appropriate TDSE. Yet, as we know, this function is not a valid state function, for it fails to satisfy the conditions of Â§ 3.5. This example reminds us that Rule To represent a quantum state, a function must satisfy the TDSE of the system and be normalizable, single-valued, continuous, and smoothly-varying. 9The general rules for differentiating exponents I'm using are handy problem-solving tools. Here are their general forms: ~ei(kr-wt) = (ik)ne i (kr-wt ) 8x n ~ei(kr-wt) = (_iw )ne i(kr -wt) at n Sec. 6.2 Satisfying Examples 191 Example 6.3. The Gaussian Free-Particle State Function Now let's tackle the wave packet 1If(x, t) = ~ JOOA(k)ei(k:z:-wt ) dk. y27r - 00 (6.35) (6.36) To simplify the proof that this function satisfies the TDSE (6.15b), let's write this equa- tion more compactly, as (it. - E)1If(x, t) = O. For the wave packet (6.35), the operator (it. - E)1If(x, t) is (it. - E)1If(x,t) = _!f.~ [_I_j OOA(k)ei[kx-Ak2/(2m)tl - 2m 8x 2 $ - 00 _ ili~[_I_j OOA(k)ei[k:z:-Ak2/ (2m)t)dk] . 8t $ - 00 To prove that the right-hand side is zero, we must first get rid of the unsightly partial derivatives parading through it. The amplitude function A(k) is independent of x and t, so we can treat it as a constant when we evaluate 82/8x 2 and 8/at. Let's interchange the order of integration and differentiation in both terms in (6.36) and slide these derivatives through the integrals.' \" (it. - E )1If(x, t) = _!f.jOOA(k) [~eilk:z:-lik21(2m)tl] dk 2m 8x 2 - 00 - iii1:A(k) [:/Ik:z:-lik 2/(2m)t)] dk. (6.37) (6.38) [I have also done a little housecleaning in (6.37), eliminating factors of 1/$ from each term.] But we've already evaluated the derivatives in Eq. (6.37) in Example 6.2. Using Eqs. (6.33) we find (it. - E)1If(x,t) =1:A(k) [~~2-iii(_i:::)] e i[k:z:-lik2/(2m)t)dk. Now, the expression in square brackets in (6.38) is zero-which proves that the wave packet (6.35) satisfies the TDSE of a free particle. This wave packet also is normalizable, continuous, and smoothly-varying, so it can represent a state of this system. Notice that this verification applies to any free-particle wave packet, because nowhere did we specify a particular amplitude function. In practice, we never need explicitly verify that a superposition such as the free- particle wave packet satisfies the TDSE of a system. Once we know that the constituents of the superposition satisfy this equation, we can conclude that their linear combination does. This vital property-the Principle of Superposition we first saw in Chap. 3- follows from the mathematical characteristics of the Schrodinger equation, which we're going to investigate right now. lOWhat lets us do this is a theorem (from freshman calculus) called Leibniz's Rule. According to this rule, we can legitimately interchange the order of integration and differentiation in terms like those appearing in Eq. (6.35) provided two conditions are met: (I ) the integrand must be sectionally continuous. i.e., it must have at most a finite number of point discontinuities; and (2) the integral must converge uniformly before and after the differentiation. 192 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion 6.3 A PERSONALITY PROFILE ()F THE TOSE Just as our friends have identifiable personality traits-grumpy, chummy, psychotic, etc.-so do equations have distinctive characteristics. One of the best ways to become familiar with a new equation is to identify its \"mathematical personality.\" In this section, we'll \"matho-analyze\" the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation (TDSE). A physicist is interested in the TDSE as the equation that determines the space and time dependence of state functions. But a mathematician, looking at this equation, sees a linear. homogeneous partial differential equation of second order. I I Each of these mathematical attributes of the TDSE has important physical con- sequences. For instance, in Â§ 6.1, I noted that the (mathematical) fact that the TDSE contains a first-order time derivative requires us to feed it (physical) information con- cerning the quantum state at the initial time: MATHEMATICS first-order time derivative <=> <=> PHYSICS initial conditions In this section we'll discover several more examples of the beautiful interrelationship between mathematics and physics that permeates quantum mechanics. Question 6-2 We've already noted another attribute of the TDSE: the presence of an i = A implies that its solutions must, in general, be complex. Prove that no realfunction of x and t can solve the TDSE. [Hint: What differential equation does W'(x, t) satisfy?) On Boundary Conditions In Â§ 6.1, I remarked that in order to specify a particular solution of the TDSE, we must provide the values of the state function at two locations; these values are boundary conditions. [Alternatively, we could provide the value of 111(x, t) and its first derivative 8111(x, t)j8x at one location.] For example, the following conditions must apply at all times to most wave functions for a single particle in one dimension that is confined (by the potential of the system) to a finite region of space: lI1(x,t) --+ 0 lI1(x, t) --+ 0 as x --+ -00 as x --+ +00. [at all times t] (6.39) These conditions are familiar from Chap. 3 as statements that the wave function must be spatially localized [see Eq. (3.29)]. But Eqs. (6.39) may not correspond to your notion of boundary conditions, for they prescribe the values of 111(x, t) not at two (finite) points in space, but rather in two limits: x --+ -00 and x --+ +00. Only in special model problems are boundary conditions for a one-dimensional system specified at finite points. A familiar and important example is the particle-in-a- box of Example 6.1. For the states of this system, the boundary conditions are the values of lI1(x, t) at the \"walls\": lI1(x = -!L, t) = 0 lI1(x = +!L, t) = O. (6.4Oa) (6.40b) 11 Recall that a differentialequation is said to be of n-th order if the highest derivative it contains is of order n. Thus, although the TDSE contains s first-order time derivative, it is a second-order equation, because its highest order derivative is {j2 / ox2 â€¢ Sec. 6.3 A Personality Profile of the rDSE 193 These boundary conditions are a consequence of the physical environment of the particle. The \"walls\" of the box are impenetrable, because the potential energy outside is infinite. [This model is the limit of the potential of a physical system in which a particle experi- ences extremely strong impulsive forces at these two points (see Â§ 8.1 and Pblm. 8.11).] So the particle cannot \"escape,\" and the probability that we will detect it at x ~ -L/2 or at x ~ +L/2 in a position measurement is zero. Mathematically, this means the probability density P(x , t) is zero outside the box , and so is the wave function. The requirement that this function be continuous everywhere (Â§ 3.5) leads us to the boundary conditions (6.40),12 Aside: Boundary Conditions in Three Dimensions. How we specify boundary conditions for three-dimensional quantum systems depends on the coordinate system we choose to work in. For instance , a widely-used three-dimensional model potential is a \"spherical box\" of radius a: { -Vo r s aj V~) = .Or> a This potential is spherically symmetric; that is, it's independent of the angles 9 and <po So the chore of determining the state functions of a particle with this potential will be simplified if we choose to work in a coordinate system that conforms to this symmetry property: the spherical coordinates (r, 9, <pl. In spherical coordinates (see Volume II), the kinetic energy operator T contains second-order partial derivatives with respect to r, 9, and <po To specify a particular state function , therefore, we must provide six boundary conditions-two for each variable. The boundary conditions on r , for example, are specified as follows: lI1(r = 0,9, <p) = constant; lI1(r, 9, <p) ~ 0 r -oc (6.41a) (6.41b) (In Part V, we'll delve into the boundary conditions for the variables 9 and <p.) Notice that in (6.41) we state one boundary condition at a point, r = 0, and the other in a limit , r -+ 00. Linearity and Homogeneity: A Mathematical Side-Trip Our quantum equation of motion, the TDSE, is a special type of second-order partial differential equation: it is linear and homogeneous. I want to show you the physical con- sequences of these properties, but first we should review their definitions. For simplicity, I'll begin with an ordinary differential equation. The general form of an ordinary differential equation of order n in the variable x is dn dn - l ao(x) dx fl f(x) + al (x) dx fl - l f(x) dn - 2 +a2(x) dx n-2 f(x) + ... + an(x)f(x) = g(x ). (6.42) 12you may be concerned by the fact that the first derivative of lIt(x , t) is not continuous at the walls- i.e.â€¢ the state functions of the infinite square well are not smoothly varying at x = Â±L/2. Not to worry: this property is an artifice of the infinite potential in this model. The function 811t(x , t) /8x is discontinuous at the walls because there is a discontinuous change in the potential energy at these points. Actual potentials may change sharply and drastically. but they invariably do so continuously . 194 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion The prefactors ai(x) may be constants or functions and can be real or complex. If the function g(x) on the right-hand side is zero, then this equation is said to be homogeneous. But if g(x) i= 0, the equation is said to be inhomogeneous.P Notice that a linear equation cannot contain terms involving powers of f(x) or of its derivatives; terms such as or destroy the linearity of a differential equation. Similarly, a linear equation must not contain terms involving products of f(x) and one or more of its derivatives; terms such as f (x) ~f(x) or [d~f(X)] d~3f(x) are also forbidden . If any such terms befoul the purity of a differential equation, then that equation is non-linear-and is to be avoided if possible. Here are a couple of examples: ~f(X)+ sinx = 0 (6.43) is a linear equation. But is not. [d~h(X)r+ h(x)sinx = 0 (6.44) \"I don't care about ordinary differential equations,\" you mutter. \"The TDSE is a partial differential equation. Tell me about partial differential equations!\" Okay. The general form of a partial differential equation of arbitrary order in several variables is a mess-lots and lots of terms. So I'll show you the general form for a second-order, linear, partial differential equation in two independent variables. Since we're interested in the TDSE, I'll use x and t as the independent variables: 82 8 8 8 2 ao(x, t) 8 2 f (x , t) + al (x , t )-8 f(x, t) + a2(X, t)-8 f(x , t) + a3(x , t) 8t 2 f(x , t) x x 82 t (6.45) + a4(x , t) 8x8t f(x , t) + a5(x, t)f(x , t) = g(x , t) . The multiplicative factors ai(x , t )--one or more of which may be constant or zero--are, in general, complex functions of the independent variables x and t. If g(x , t) = 0, Eq. (6.45) is homogeneous; otherwise it is inhomogeneous. The kind of terms that can populate a linear partial differential equation are limited . Absolutely forbidden are terms containing powers of derivatives of f(x, t) or products offactors involving f(x , t) and its derivatives: e.g., or 8 f(x, t) 8x f(x, t) . l :lMathematicians have a slightly different-but equivalent-s-definition of a homogeneou s differential equation: Suppose a function f (x) satisfies a linear differential equation such as (6.42). If cf (x ) satisfies the same equation. where c is an arbitrary complex constant, then the equation is said to be homogeneous. Take a moment to convince yourself that this definition is equivalent to the one given in the text. Sec. 6.3 A Personality Profile of the TDSE 195 (6.46) It is easy to see that the TDSE (6.14) for a single particle in one dimension conforms to the form (6.45). If we gather all its terms on the left-hand side, we get h2 a 2 â€¢ a--a 2 llJ(x, t) + V(x, t)llJ(x, t) - zh- a llJ(x, t) = 0, 2m x t which form makes it easy to read off the prefactors ai(x, t) for the TDSE: r,2 ao(x, t) = - 2m al(X, t) = 0 a2(X, t) = -ih a3(X, t) = 0 a4(x, t) = 0 as(x, t) = V(X, t) A Little About Linear Differential Operators (6.47) (6.48) Because of the rather ungainly complexity of the general form (6.45), mathematicians often use a shorthand notation for its operators. I'll use D(x, t) to denote a general linear, second-order differential operator in x and t. l 4 The general form of a linear operator is A a2 a a D(x, t) == ao(x, t) ax2 + al (x , t) ax + a2(x , t) at a 2 a 2 + a3(x, t) at2 + a4(x, t) axat + as(x, t). This notation enables us to write the general second-order linear differential equation (6.45) as D(x, t)f(x, t) = g(x, t) and the TDSE as D(x, t)llJ(x , t) = O. For the latter, the differential operator D(x, t) is D(x , t) = if. - E =T+V-E h2 a 2 a = - 2m ax2 + V(x, t) - ih at' Note carefully that (6.50) is a homogeneous differential equation. (6.49) (6.50) (6.510) (6.5lb) (6.5lc) 14The operator D(x , t) belongs to a general class of mathematical critters called linear operators . Such operators playa very important role in quantum theory (see Chap. 10). By definition, an operator A is linear if for any two functions It and h, By the way, please don't misconstrue my notational whimsy. The argument (x, t) I've appended to the general linear operator is there just to remind us what the independent variables are. The notation D(x, t) does not imply that D acts on x and/or on t. 196 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion Aside: The TDSE in Three Dimensions. The TDSE (6.18) for a single particle in three dimensions is a linear, homogeneous differential equation in four variables. For this case, the linear operator corresponding to (6.51) is â€¢ Ii? 2 . 8 D(r, t) = - 2m \"i1 + V(r , t) - tli 8 t ' [three-dimensions] (6.52) Similarly, we can generalize the operator (6.52) to several particles in three dimensions (Volume II). Justifying the Normalization of State Functions To start our investigation of the properties of a linear homogeneous differential equation such as the TDSE (6.51), we'll consider a feature that is related to the normalization procedure we developed in Â§ 3.5. Suppose a function f(x, t) solves D(x , t)f(x, t) = O. Then, for any complex constant c, the function ef(x , t) also solves this equation; i.e., ID(x , t)f(x) = 0 D(x, t)[ef(x , t)] = 0 I (6.53) (6.55) (Do you see why? Here's a hint: What happens to the constant e when it is acted upon by a linear differential operator?) This simple fact justifies our procedure for normalizing state functions. Remember how we do this: If the function Ilf'(x, t) satisfies the TDSE but has a normalization integral equal to a finite number M :f= I , then we construct the corresponding normalized function by multiplying Ilf'(x , t ) by a complex constant: ei6 Ilf(x, t) = ../M1lf'(x, t). (6.54) The constant 6 in the global phase factor ei6 is an arbitrary real number. The new function satisfies the normalization condition L:Ilf*(x ,t)llf(x , t) dx = 1, and therefore can be meaningfully interpreted as a position probability amplitude. The property (6.53) assures us that if Ilf'(.x,t) satisfies the TDSE, so does its normalized counterpart Ilf(x, t). The second mathematical property we're going to explore leads to a physical prin- ciple so important that it gets its own section. 6.4 SUPERPOSITION DERIVED Like (6.53), which we used to justify normalization, our second property follows from the linearity and homogeneity of the TDSE. Suppose ft (x , t ) and hex, t ) solve D(x ,t )f(x, t) = O. Because this equation is homogeneous, the sum of these functions is also a solution; i.e., ~(x,t)ft (x, t) = O} D (x , t )h(x , t) = 0 D(x, t ) [ft (x , t) + hex , t)] = O. (6.56) Sec. 6.4 Superposition ')erived 197 Taken together, properties (6.53) and (6.56) reveal that Rule Any linear combination of solutions of a linear. homogeneous differential equation is another solution of that equation. So if /1 (x, t) and h(x, t) solve D(x, t)/(x , t) = 0 and if Cl and C2 are arbitrary complex constants, then clh (x , t) + c2h(x , t) also solves this equation: ~(x,t)h (x , t) = O} D(x, t)h(x, t) = 0 D(x , t) [clh (x, t) + c2h(x , t)] = O. (6.57) This property can be extended to an arbitary linear combination of solutions; when applied to the TDSE, it leads to the Principle of Superposition. Let lit 1 and lit2 represent quantum states of a system with Hamiltonian it,15 (it - E)1It1 = 0 (it - E)1It2 = 0 (6.58) From the linearity and homogeneity of the TDSE we conclude [see Eq. (6.57)] that for arbitrary constants Cl and C2, Therefore-and most importantly-the linear combination (6.59) [a superposition state] (6.60) represents a quantum state that is different from the ones represented by lit 1 and lit2. This is a mathematical way of stating the Principle of Superposition. Our little demonstration shows that this cornerstone of quantum physics is a manifestation of the mathematical character of the TDSE. 16 Example 6.4. A Superposition State of the Particle in a Box To see a superposition state of a particular system, let's return to our simple paradigm, the particle in a box. At t = 0, the wave function of the ground state of this system is [Eq. (6.21)] (6.6la) 151n this section. I have omitted the position and time dependence from the wave function to emphasize that these results pertain to any quantum system . 16The superposit ion state (6 .60) is physically realizable (i .e., it represents a state that could exist in the laboratory) only if 111(x , t) is continuous, smoothly-varying. single-valued . and normalizable. Its normalizability follows automatically if the composite functions 1111 and 1112 are themselves normalizable. But they need not be; we saw in Â§ 4.2 (on wave packets) that we can form a normalizable superposit ion of an infinite number of non-normallzabte functions . 198 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion The well-defined energy of this state (!:i.E = 0) is 1r2 1i? E 1 = 2mL2 ' (6.6Ib) The stationary state nearest in energy to the ground state is called the first excited state. At t = 0 the wave function of this state is W2(X,0) = Ifsin (21ryJ I and its well-defined energy is (6.620) (6.62b) Question ~3 Verify that W2(X,t) satisfies the TDSE for the particle in a box. [You will have to generalize the function in (6.62a) to times t > 0, just as we did for the ground state in Example 6.1.) Now, according to the Principle of Superposition, any linear combination of W1 (x, t) and W2(X, t) represents a third physically realizable state of this system. Suppose we mix 2 parts W1 (x , t) to 7 parts W2(X, t) to brew the normalized state function (6.63) This function , which is graphed at t = 0 along with its constituents in Fig. 6.3, represen ts a physically realizable state of the panicle in an infinite square well. You can see how it differs from the ground and first-excited states by examining the position information in the probability amplitudes. 1.00.0 (b) -1 .5 Ll..L..L.I.............L..I..Ju..L............u..Ll..L~u..L.u..Ju..L............u.............u -1 .00.0 (a) I I 'V2 ( x , O) I \\ \\, I\\ I \\ I '_ ... 1.0 0.0 E--------I'--------....\" 1.5 1'\"T\"T'TT'1\"TTT'T'TTT\"T'TTTT'1r'TTTT'l\"TTT'T'TTT\"T'TTTT'1r'TTTTT1 0.5 Figure 6.3 A superposition state of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well.

(6.63) is normalized, [You can use the fact that lit1(X, 0) and lit2 (x ,0) are individually normalized . Oh yes . . . Watch those limits of integrat ion!] The superposition state (6.63) differs from its constituents in another important way: its energy is not sharp. Were we to calculate the energy uncertainty AE(t) from (6.63), we would obtain AE > O. I'll spare you the algebraic contortions of this evaluation ; in Chap. 12, I'll show you an easy way to calculate such uncertainties . In Example 6.4 we constructed a non-stationary state from two stationary states. But, as I noted in Â§ 3.2, we can extend the Principle of Superposition to more than two stationary states. Or we can combine two or more non-stationary states to form yet another non-stationary state. But all of the functions we combine to form such a superposition must solve the same Schriidinger equation. 6.5 IS PROBABILITY CONSERVED? The TDSE has many uses. Foremost is its role in the determination of state functions. But we can also use this fundamental equation to address physical questions about the microworld. To illustrate (and to develop a result we'll need in Â§ 6.8), I want to consider the question of particle conservation: is the total number of particles conserved, or can particles be created and destroyed? 17 In the language of probabilities, this question becomes a query about the position probability density: is the probability of finding a particle anywhere in space independent of time? We express this question mathematically in terms of the integrated probability P([ - oo, 00], t) of Â§ 3.4. This quantity is the sum of the infinitesimal position probabilities P (x, t) dx for all values of z, i.e., [Eq. (3.26)] P([-oo, 00], t) = I:P(x, t) dx = I:1lJ*(x, t )llJ(x, t) dx. If microscopic particles are neither created nor destroyed, then this quantity must be independent of time-which is precisely the result I want to prove: Proclamation 6.1 The probability of finding a microscopic particle anywhere in space does not change with time-i.e., (non-relativistic) particles are neither created nor destroyed . 17 Since the TDSE applies only to non-relativistic systems, our answer will pertain only to particles whose velocities are much less than the speed of light. Particle creation and destruction does occur at relativistic energies. If. for example, an electron and a positron (a particle with the same mass as an electron but with the opposite charge) collide. they can mutually annihilate, creating photons. The reverse process. in which photons create an electron-positron pair, also occurs.

(3.29)] P ([-00, 001,to) = 1. (6.66) (6.67a) (6.68) But Eq. (6.66) does not imply Eq. (6.65). To prove conservation of probability, we must look to the Schrodinger equation. Question 6-5 Explain why we cannot conclude from (6.66) that (6.65) is true. [Hint : If \\11(x , to) is normalized at time to, can we conclude that it is normalized at any other time t 1 :f; to? If not, why not?) Argument: We're going to prove Proclamation 6.1 for an arbitrary state of an arbitrary system . The proof uses only two facts: [I] the wave function W(x, t) satisfies the TDSE . a 'HW(x , t) = iii at W(x, t); [2] the wave function is spatially localized-i.e., it satisfies the boundary con- ditions [Eq.

(6.70) and (6.72) into (6.69), we find (6.71) (6.72) d j oo{ i A i [ A ] * }dt P([-oo, 00], t) = - oc -\"hllt*(x,t)'}illt(x, t) + \"hllt(x, t) '}illt(x , t) dx (6.730) = -*J OC {1It*(x, t)illlt(x, t) - lit(x, t) [illlt(x, t)r} dx. - oc (6.73b) Now, the Hamiltonian is il = T + V, so we can write Eq. (6.73b) as the sum of two integrals, one each for T and for V: ~P([-oo, 00],t) = -*i:{1It*(x ,t)TIIt(x, t) -1It(x ,t) [TIIt(x, t)] *} dx -*i:{1It*(x,t)VlIt(x, t) -1It(x,t) [VIIt(x,t)r} dx. (6.74) But the potential energy V (x, t) is real, so lit(x, tHVIIt(x ,t)]* = lit*(x, t)VIIt(x, t ), and the second integral in (6.74) is zero. We're left with ~P([-oo,oo],t) = -*i:{1It*(x,t)TIIt(x ,t) -1It(x, t) [Tilt (x, t)r} dx. (6.75) Look carefully at the two terms in (6.75): do they obviously cancel? That is, can we use the argument that eliminated the potential-energy integral from (6.73) to conclude that lit*(x, t)TIIt(x, t) is equal to lit(x,t) [TIIt(x,t)] *? Absolutely not! The kinetic energy operator T is a differential operator, A n 2 82 T------ 2m 8x 2 , (6.76) so it can alter the mathematical form of the function it operates on. The terms in (6.75) do cancel, but to prove this point we must take account of boundary conditions. And we must be crafty. We start this last step in our demonstration by inserting the explicit form of J ' from (6.76) into (6.75): d in [jOO 82 8 2 ]dt P( [- oo, 00], t) = 2m - 00 lit* (x, t) 8x211t(x, t ) - lIt(x, t) 8x211t*(x, t) dx . (6.77) 202 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion To subdue the rather nasty integral in (6.77), I'm going to introduce a clever (but not necessarily obvious) mathematical trick.l? We're going to invoke a theorem familiar from first-year calculus that you probably know as The Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus: l b (:) dx = feb) - f(a). (6.78) (6.79) To apply this theorem to (6.77), we must first rewrite its integrand as a differential, 82 82 w*(x , t) 8x2W(x, t) - w(x, t) 8x2W*(x, t) = 88 x [w* (x, t) 88 x w(x, t) - w(x, t) :x w*(x, t)] , which transforms the integral into the desirable form d j oo -d P(x,t)dx t - :>0 iii roo 8 [* 8 8 * ]= -2m}+ 00 8x W (x ,t)8x W(x,t)-w(x,t)8x w (x,t) dx . (6.80) [Notice carefully that I switched the limits of integration in this equation. This is not mere caprice; the reason for it will become clear in Â§ 6.7.] We can now use Eq. (6.78) to eliminate the integral in our expression (6.77) for the rate of change, which becomes d J OC iii [8 8]- :>0-d P(x, t)dx = -- w*(x , t)-8 w(x, t ) - w(x, t )-8 w*(x, t) t - 00 2m x X :>o (6.81) But according to the boundary condition (6.67b), each term on the right-hand side of (6.81) is zero at the upper and lower limits. So the right-hand side of (6.81) is zero, which proves conservation of probability (6.65).20 Q.E.D. Aside: Introducing Hermiticity. From Eq. (6.81) we can derive an important property of the Hamiltonian operator. Take a look at Eq. (6.73b). We have proven that the left-hand side of this equation is zero. Therefore, for any state function w(x, t), the Hamiltonian obeys I:w*(x,t)Hw(x,t)dx =I:W(x,t) [HW(x,t>]* dx. (6.82) 19OOn't worry about how you would divine this trick without being shown it. Most of us stumble onto such tricks after lots of false starts and error s, As you wor ; through hundreds of physics problems, you will discover tricks of your own. But a word to the wise: wh :n you find one, comm it it to memory , so it will emerge from your subconscious mind when you need it. 20This proof can be extended to three-dimensional one-particle systems and to many-particle systems. The essential tool is a mathematical result called Green's Theorem, which can transform an integral over a finite volume into an integral over the surface that bounds the volume . You can find the proof for a single-particle in three dimensions in Â§ 3-5 of Robert H. Dicke and James P. Wittke , Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (Reading , Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1960). For the many-particle case, see Â§ 54 (ii) of Quantum Mechanics. Volume II by Sir-Itiro Tomonaga (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1966). Sec. 6.5 Is Probability Conserved? 203 This property is called Hermiticity, and an operator that satisfies such a condition is said to be Hermitian. As we shall learn in Chap. II, Hermiticity is an important property of all quantum mechanical operators . Conservation of probability is another brick in the wall of self-consistency that supports quantum theory. Without it, the interpretation of lJ1(x, t) as a position probability amplitude would be on shaky ground, because we would have no guarantee that an increase in the probability inside a finite region corresponds to a decrease outside the region. Question 6-(j Explain why the normalization integral J~oo 1lJ\" (x, t)llJ(x, t) dx is independent of time. This result guarantees that we need normalize a state function only once. Question 6-7 What would happen to conservation of probability if the TDSE were inhomogeneous? That is, suppose (il- E)1lJ were equal to a non-zero (but well-behaved) function of x, so that the partial time derivative of the state function were given not by Eq. (6.70), but by a at llJ(x,t) i - -~1iIlJ(x,t) + f(x) . [an incorrect equation] (6.83) By repeating the proof of Proclamation 6.1 with this expression for allJ(x, t)/at, show that if the TDSE were inhomogeneous, probability would not be conserved. INTERMISSION This chapter is a long one; it has 10 sections and 139 equations! You have arrived at a way station: a good place to interrupt your study. I recommend taking a break-go to a movie, have dinner, go to bed, whatever; then come back, review the first five sections, and press on. 204 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion (6.84) *6.6 THE FREE-PARTICLE WAVE PACKET REVISITED To illustrate some of the more abstract features of motion in quantum mechanics, I'm going to lead you through a detailed study of the evolution of a single state of the free particle. The wave function that represents the state we'll consider is a Gaussian free-particle wave packet. We proved in Example 6.3 that such a packet satisfies the free-particle TDSE. We're now going to explore its propagation and change of shape. I've split this extended example into two sections: here we'll derive the time dependence of lIt(x, t), and in Â§ 6.7 we'll consider its physical interpretation.P! Wave Packets: A Quick Recap Let's briefly remind ourselves what a wave packet is and how it works. Mathematically speaking, a wave packet of the form lit(x, t) = _1_ JOO A(k)ei(kx-wt) dk ..;'iff -00 is a linear combination of an infinite number of monochromatic plane waves with infini- tesimally differing wave numbers. The amplitude function A(k) determines the mixture of plane waves in the packet. This function is characterized by its center ko = (k) and its width tlk. We calculate A(k) as the Fourier transform of the initial wave packet, A(k) = F[IIt(x, 0)]. The constituent plane waves of the packet have different wave lengths, and they interfere. All of these waves are in phase at the point where total constructive interference occurs: the center of the packet (x}(t). At all other values of z, the plane waves interfere destructively. The extent of this interference increases as Ix - xol increases, so the amplitude of the packet decreases with increasing [z - Xo I. This interference gives the packet its essential spatially-localized character. The Evolution of a Wave Packet As the packet (6.84) evolves, its center (x) (t) propagates at the group velocity (Chap. 4). Let 's place the coordinate origin, x = 0, at the center of the packet at the initial time t = O. Then the propagation of the packet as a whole is characterized by the simple equation (x) (t) = vgrt. (6.85) But something more interesting than propagation happens as time passes: the wave packet spreads. A simple qualitative argument shows why. Think about the propagating wave packet as a bundle of monochromatic plane harmonic waves, each moving at its phase velocity [Eq. (4.24)] Vph = w(k) k hk 2m [for a free particle1 (6.86) 21 Neither of these sections contains new physical results, so if you are pressed for time, you can jump to Â§ 6.8. Sec. 6.6 The Free-Particle Wave Packet Revisited 205 Since the waves in the packet move at different velocities, they disperse as the packet propagates. This dispersion inevitably causes the packet to spread as time increases. Therefore the position uncertainty ~x(t) increases with t. In this section and the next, we'll back up this argument with a (rather elaborate) calculation. In Example 6.5, we're going to solve the TDSE for a state of the free particle defined by the (Gaussian) initial condition (see Â§ 4.4) lJ1(x,O) = C:u)1/4 e ikoxe-x2 /4L 2. The corresponding amplitude function is22 This state is characterized by the statistical quantities (Table 4.1) (6.87) (6.88) (6.90b) (6.90a) (x) (0) =0 (6.89a) (P) (0) = liko (6.89b) ~x(O) = L (6.89c) ~p(O) Ii = 2L' (6.89d) Question 6-8 Prove mathematically (or justify via a careful, rigorous argument) that (6.88) is the correct amplitude function for the packet (6.87). Example 6.S. The Gaussian Free-Particle State Function We must first decide on strategy: Do we attack the TDSE for a free particle (6.30) directly, trying to solve it using methods from the theory of partial differential equations? Or is there an easier way? We know from Chap. 4 that there is an alternate way. (Whether it's easier remains to be seen.) Since we know the amplitude function (6.88), we can write the wave function for t > 0 as [Eq. (4.64Â») lIJ(x,t) = _1_ [ 00 A (k)e ilkx-lik2t/(2mJ]dk ..;z; t.: ( 2) t/4 [00 = ::'3 J- 00 exp [_L 2(k - ko) 2 + ixk - i :~k 2 ] dk. [In writing (6.9Oa), I used the dispersion relation for a free particle, (6.31).) If we can eval- uate this integral analytically, we needn't bother directly solving the TDSE. For a Gaussian initial state, this strategy works like a champ, because we can convert the integral in (6.9Ob) into a standard form that we can look up in tables (or work out analytically). To this end, we first transform this integral into one that is independent of the center ko of the amplitude function. We just shift the origin of the integral from k = 0 to k = ko by changing the dummy variable of integration from k to a new variable u := k - ko. The 22The initial wave function (6.87) differs in one small but important respect from Eq. (4.54): the center of its amplitude function (6.88) occurs at a non-zero wave number. ko. rather than at k = o. Compare this amplitude function to Eq. (4.58). 206 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion differentials for these variables are simply related by dk = du, so in terms of u , the integral in (6.90b) is lI1(x,t) ( 2) 1/4j OO = 2~3 - 00 exp [_Â£2 U2 + ix u + ixko - i2~(u2 + 2kou + k~)] duo (6.91) Equation (6.91) may not look like an improvement over (6.90b), but it is. The change of variable lets us remove from the integral several factors that do not contain u, viz., lI1(x, t) (6.92) ( Â£2 ) 1/4 i[kOX-hk~tl(2m)ljOO [(Â£2 + . n t) 2 ( .likot .)] d = 21f3 e exp - t 2m U - 2m - IX U u. - oc At first glance, this integral looks absolutely ghastly. But with a little work we can force it into an integral of the (standard ) form (see Appendix J) IRe a > OJ (6.93a) AIl we need do is define a and (3 in this form as Â£ 2 â€¢ Ii a = +t 2m t (3 .likot Â· . ( liko)= t m - tX = -t x - mt . (6.93b) (6.93c) Then we can apply (6.93a) to the wave function for a free-particle wave packet whose initial state is the Gaussian (6.87) to get ( 2) 1/4 lI1(x, t) = ;:'3 ei[ko:r.-hk~tl(2m)J [ ( hk)2]1r - X - ~t Â£2 + i 2':..t exp 4 (Â£2 + i 2':..t) . (6.94) This is the function we seek, the solution of the TDSE (6.30) subject to the initial condit ion (6.87). Question ~9 Show that you can evaluate the integral in Eq. (6.92) without recourse to integral tables by completing the square in the exponent ial. We can write our hard-earned wave function in a more useful form by cleaning up the pre-factor; introducing the group velocity vg r = liko/m and the frequency at the peak of the amplitude function, Wo = lik~/2m; and rearranging slightly the exponential, to wit: 'T'( t) [ 1 ] 1/4 i(kox-wot) [ 1 \"7\"'(,-X_-\"7\"'vK\"'-.rt..:....)2...,...].., x , = 2 e exp --...,... 21rÂ£2 (1 + i 2f1~L2t) 4Â£2 (1 + i 2f1~IL2t) This is the form we're going to investigate in the next section. (6.95) Sec. 6.6 The Free-Particle Wave Packet Revisited 207 But first, we'd better check our work. In so complicated a derivation, it's easy to make mistakes. So once you've got your answer, ask it lots of questions. For example, try evaluating it at a point, a time, or in a limit where you know the correct answer and see if it agrees. Question ~10 Show that the wave function (6.95) at t = 0 reduces to the correct initial condition, Eq. (6.87). You should also think about whether your result looks sensible. The wave function is not merely a mathematical function-it's supposed to represent a state of a free particle with the properties in Eq. (6.89): an (uncertain) momentum , peaked at Po = 1iko, and an (uncertain) energy, peaked at Eo = 1iwo. Are these properties reflected in the form of Eq. (6.95)? Finally, we should see what we can deduce from the mathematical result we've labored over. Staring at the clutter of symbols in Eq. (6.95), we espy the plane harmonic wave e i (ko x- wot ), a pure momentum function with momentum Po and energy Eo. We also see that this plane wave is modulated by a x- and t-dependent exponential and by a t-dependent prefactor. Although these factors are complicated, if we stare long enough at (6.95) we discover that its form is that of a Gaussian. This is a very elegant result: Rule A function that is a Gaussian at t = 0 remains a Gaussian forever after. This rule is illustrated in Fig. 6.4, which shows the real part of the Gaussian state function, Re{llJ(x, t)}, at three times. Question ~11 Try to see the Gaussian forest through all the algebraic trees in Eq. (6.95): Can you pick off the width ~x(t) from this form? (If not, don't fret. We'll discuss the width soon.) *6.7 THE LIFE AND TIMES OF A GAUSSIAN WAVE PACKET To study the \"motion\" of a microscopic particle, we must investigate the change with time of its probability density P(x , t), expectation value (x) (t) , and uncertainty Ax(t ). We'll first evaluate the probability density from the wave function (6.95}-an assignment that will require some algebraic adeptness. The Probability Density for a Gaussian State The hard way to obtain an expression for P(x, t ) is to substitute llJ(x, t) from (6.95) directly into P(x, t) = IIlJ(x, tWo But we can easily derive a handy form for this density by first simplifying the exponential factor in square brackets in the wave function, which for convenience I'll call F : 208 Chap . 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion (6.96) \"&' \" \"t=O~ '~ Vxo+V~----------- t = to â€¢ x â€¢ x x t = 3to_1' Figure 6.4 A schematic plot of the real part of the Gaussian wave packet (6.95) at the initial time t = 0 and at three subsequent times, to. 2to. and 3to. The center of this packet moves at the group velocity vg r = PO/m. and the width Llx(t) increases with time. [From R. B. Leighton, Principles of Modern Physics (New York: McGraw-Hili. 1959).] (6.97) The troublemaker is the innocent-looking i = R in the denom inator of this factor. Let's move this i into the numerator by multiplying both numerator and denomi- nator by the complex conjugate of the offending denominator, viz., F = __1_ (x - vgrt )2 (1 - i-d!-v t) 4Â£2 (1 + i 2: L2 t) (1 - i 2:Â£2t) . Multiplying the factors in the denominator of (6.97) and putting our new form for F into (6.95), we obtain the following form for the free-particle, Gaussian state function.P 1/4 ( ) 1/2 w(x, t) = (271'1Â£2 ) 1 + i~t x ei(kox-wot ) exp [__1_ (x - vgrt)2(1 - i-d!v t)] 4Â£2 1 + h 2 t 2 4m 2[,' (6.98) Now we can easily take the complex conjugate of (6.98) and construct the probability density 23The part of the prefactor in this wave function that normalizes it is (27l'L 2) 1/ 4. The rest of the prefactor is part of the time dependence of the wave function.

First fill in the gap between Eqs, (6.98) and (6.99). Then confirm from the initial wave function (6.87) that (6.1(0) Then show that (6.99) reduces to this at t = O. In Fig. 6.5, I've graphed this probability density at three equally-spaced times. These graphs show how the region in which the particle is most likely to be found changes with time. The position of the center of this region, (x) (t ), changes linearly with t, as in Eq. (6.85).

The wave number and initial (t = 0) width are ko = 1 and L = 1/../2, respectively. Figure 6.5 also shows that as \\11(x, t) evolves, P(x , t) changes shape. This is the wave packet spreading I alluded to in Â§ 6.6. This odd-and wholly quantum mechanical-phenomenon can be seen in the laboratory: the later the time at which we perform such a measurement, the more likely we are to detect the particle far from the center of the packet, (x)(t) . 210 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion Extracting the Width Figure 6.5 graphically illustrates the increase with time of the position uncertainty of a free particle with a Gaussian wave function. This phenomenon is the physical conse- quence of wave packet spreading. To scrutinize it quantitatively, we need an expression for this uncertainty, 6.x (t) = J(x2) (t) - (x)2 (t). We could, of course, just substitute the state function (6.98) into each of the expectation values in this expression and start integrating. But the resulting algebra is a nightmare. [It's (x2 ) (t) , by the way, that generates the awkward algebra; we already know (x) (t) = likot/m.] So I'd like to describe an alternative approach: extracting the width. This stratagem doesn't always work, but it may save so much work that it's worth a try. The idea is to read the width function directly from the wave function or, in this case, from the probability density. First we'll write the probability density at t = 0 in a form that contains the initial width [Eq. (6.89c)], 6.x(O) = L. Then we'll compare P(x, 0) to P(x, t) and deduce the width 6.x(t) . You derived the probability density at t = 0 for a Gaussian state function, Eq. (6.100), when you worked Question 6-12 . Replacing L in this equation by 6.x(O), we have P(x,O) = 1 e- x 2/2[~x(OW. 27r[6.x(0)]2 (6.101) Now, look at the density for t > 0, Eq. (6.99). Comparing this function to its t = 0 form (6.101) , we find that we can write it as P(x,t) = 1 [ (x - vg rt) 2] 27r[6.x(t)]2 exp - 2[6.x(t)]2 Probability Densityfor a Gaussian Wave Packet (6.102) (6.103) provided the square of the width function is [6.x(tW = Â£2 (1+ 4~:Â£4 t 2) = [6.X(0)]2 (1+ 4m2[~:(0)]4t 2) . This comparison gives for the position uncertainty for a particle in a state represented by a Gaussian wave packet with initial uncertainty 6.x(O) the simple result (6.104)6.x(t) = 6.x(O) li 2 1 + 4m 2[6.x(0)]4 t 2. [for a Gaussian wave packet] Notice that at t = 0, Eq. (6.104) reduces to 6.x(O) = L, as it should. Using the identification (6.104), we have written P(x, t) in a form that corresponds to a Gaussian state function of width 6.x(t) and that correctly reduces to Eq. (6.100) at t = O. [The form (6.102) also shows explicitly how the probability density depends on the statistical quantities that characterize the wave packet, (x) (t) and 6.x(t).] This argument does not, of course, constitute a rigorous proof that (6.104) is the correct width, but it is highly suggestive. Question 6-13 Evaluate the position uncertainty from the expectation values of (x 2 ) and (x) . (You may not want to do this exercise; you will have to grind through considerable algebra to obtain Eq. (6.104). It should, however, convince you of the enormous amount of work you can Sec. 6.7 The Ufe and limes of a Gaussian Wave Packet 211 save by thinking carefully before you calculate , asking yourself the question: can I get the result I need by reasoning rather than manual labor?) Middle-Age Spread In Fig. 6.6, I've graphed the position uncertainty (6.104). This graph vivifies our specu- lation based on the probability density graphs in Fig. 6.5: the position uncertainty for a free particle in a Gaussian state increases with time . And it reveals something new: this increase is at first quite gradual, and then becomes linear. The increasing imprecision in the position of the particle is a physical consequence of the dispersion of the constituent waves in the wave packet. It is one of the marvels of quantum mechanics. Figure 6.6 The width ~x (t) of the Gaussian wave packet as a function of time. Initially the packet retains its shape, but once the width gets on the linear part of this curve, its spreading becomes noticeable. 2.0 1.6 1.4 1.2 -;:; >( 1.0 <l 0.8 ~x(O) 0.6 0.4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Let's look more closely at the life of a wave packet. Suppose that initially it has a well-defined shape, corresponding to a small (but non-zero) width .Ilx(O). We let the packet go, monitoring its career by ensemble measurements of position. We can use Eq. (6.104) to predict the results of these measurements. Immediately after t = 0, the second term under the square root, h.2t2/(4m 2L 4 ) , will remain small compared to 1. So at these times the width is, to a good approximation, unchanged: .Ilx(t) ~ .Ilx(O) = L . At such times, the spreading of our Gaussian packet is barely noticeable: a youthful packet retains its shape. But eventually, at times t ~ 2mL2In, the width begins to increase more sharply (on the linear part of the curve in Fig. 6.6), and the packet, now entering middle-age , begins to spread noticeably. The rest of the life of our wave packet is not a happy one. For t Â» 2mL2In, it is bloated and nearly shapeless: ~x(t) is enormous. At such times, we know almost nothing about where the particle is likely to be found, because the position uncertainty is huge. In the limit t -> 00, the packet loses all definition. In this limit, we can no longer even meaningfully define its center, and we know nothing about the particle's location. This spreading and ultimate loss of definition of a wave packet is inevitable-a consequence not of external forces or even poor dietary habits, but of natural law, 212 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion Uncertainties Galore So far I've focused on the position uncertainty, partly because this quantity is directly related to the spreading of the wave packet (and partly because I think it's more interesting than the momentum uncertainty). Still , to complete the story of the Gaussian function, we ought to look at !:i.p and the uncertainty product !:i.x(t ) !:i.p. The momentum uncertainty is a little less interesting than !:i.x because it doesn 't change. Since the amplitude function A(k) [and hence the momentum probability am- plitude cP(p)] for a free particle is independent of t (Chap. 4), so is the momentum uncertainty, h !:i.p(t ) = !:i.p(O) = 2L' (6.105) [From now on I'll drop the superfluous argument from !:i.p.] The position and momentum uncertainties must obey the omnipresent Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP), !:i.x(t )!:i.p ~ h/2, which requirement provides a dandy way to verify our work in this section. Using Eqs. (6.98), we find that the uncertainty product at t = 0 is !:i.x(O)!:i.p = h/2, the smallest value the HUP allows! This is a very unusual occurrence-equality in the HUP-and it occurs only for the Gaussian wave packet at t = O. It is why physicists refer to this packet as the minimum uncertainty wave packet. We know that the HUP will be satisfied for t > 0, because !:i.x(t) increases with time and !:i.p doesn't change. More quantitatively, their product increases as h = 2 (6.I06a ) [for a Guassian Wave Function] (6.I06b) (6.107) [Notice that only at t = 0 is the uncertainty product independent of the initial width of the packet, !:i.x(O) = L.] Question 6-14 Gazing intently at the state functions in Fig. 6.4, we notice that the local wavelength of the oscillations on either side of the center of the packet at the times shown, (x) (to) = nPoto n m are smaller on the right than on the left. Explain this observation. (Hint: The wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum.) In this section we have plumbed the depths of a Gaussian wave packet. I hope this extended example has helped you develop an intuition for how a typical state function evolves. The phenomena we've seen-propagation of the packet at the group velocity and spreading-are characteristic of nearly all (non-stationary) wave functions. But in some systems, spreading takes on bizarre characteristics: if a microscopic particle is bound in the potential of a simple harmonic oscillator potential, the packet sloshes back and forth in the well . But to see this, you'll have to wait 'til Chap. 9. Sec. 6.7 The Life and Times of a Gaussian Wave Packet 213 6.8 PROBABILITY FLUID AND ITS FLOW The pictures in Figs. 6.5 of the Gauss ian probability density at three times suggests an analogy to the evolution of a quantum state. It is as though there is a current of \"probability fluid\" that flows through space. At any fixed time, the density of this fluid is largest where the particle is most likely to be found. This analogy is the basis of an extremely useful concept-the probability current density-which affords us new insight into quantum motion.P\" A Notion of Motion To introduce the idea of a probability current, let's think about an ensemble measurement of position . Consider a detector fixed somewhere on the x axis , as in the region [a, bj in Fig. 6.7a. Suppose an ensemble of particles is incident on the detector from the left, i.e., in the direction of increasing z, in a quantum state represented by a wave packet 1II(x, t) . The detector measures the position probability by counting the number of particles that it registers per unit time . An actual detector measures the probability in a finite interval, which I'll denote [a, bj. The quantum mechanical quantity this device measures is the integratedprobability of Â§ 3.4 [Eq. (3.26)], probability of detection in [a, bj = P ([a,bj,t) = l b P (x , t) dx = l b 11II(x, tW dx. (6.108) We interpret this quantity (in the gospel according to Born) as the probability that in an ensemble measurement of position at time t; we'll find the particle in the detector region [a, bj. In practice, then, P ([a, bj, t) is what we measure when we measure position. Let's see how the integrated probability changes with time. Initially (i .e., at t = 0) , the state function is localized far from the detector at (x) (0) (Fig. 6.7a). At this time, then, the detector registers P ([a, b],0) ~ 0.25 As time passes, the particle moves in the direction of increasing z , first into and then out of the detector region-a process shown in the \"snapshots\" of Figs. 6.7b--6.7d. What happens to P ([a, bj, t) while this is going on? Well, the first change in this quantity occurs at the time t 1 > 0 when the particle is close enough to the detector that this device measures a non-zero probability P ([a, b] ,td. Thereafter, P ([a, b], t) increases until the time tz when the maximum of P(x , t) is very 24Probability flow is included here because the associated derivations and concepts follow closely from the material in the previous sections. But if you want to get on to Chap. 7, you can defer Â§ 6.8 and 6.9 until you begin studying one-dimensional scattering in Chap. 8. If you choose this option, insert these two sections just before Â§ 8.2. 25Strictly speaking. there might be a minute position probability within [a, b)-if, for example, the wave packet is a Gaussian , which never equals zero for finite x. But since the accuracy of real detectors is limited, we can always arrange the apparatus so that (x}(O) is large enough to give a negligible reading. Note, by the way, that throughout this discussion we're ignoring the details of the interaction of the particle with the detector. The difficult question of how a measuring apparatus interacts with the particle whose properties it is measuring, is treated in advanced books, such as Measurement and Time Reversal in Objective Quantum Theory by F. J. Belinfante (New York: Pergamon, 1975). 214 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion (x)(O) a b r=O Initial condition (a) P( [a. bl . 0) :: 0 a b r =r, (b) ~P1I\"bl\"'I>P1[e, b\"'\" a b (c) a b (d) Figure 6.7 One-dimensional probability flow in a beam. (a) Initially, the particles are so far from the detector region [a, b] that the detector registers zero. Sketches (bHd) show the gradual encroachment by the packet on the space defined by the detector: (b) As ensemble nears the detector, more and more of the probability density is within the detector region [a, bJ. Consequently the integrated probability P([a, b) j t) increases until (c) time t2 , when it attains its maximum. (d) As the particle moves on, the measured probability dies to zero . near the detector (Fig. 6.7c), After this, P ([a,bj, t ) decreases, ultimately returning to an immeasurably small value when the packet no longer significantly overlaps the region [a, bj (i.e., t > t3 in Fig. 6.7d). These qualitative changes in the integrated probability are sketched in Fig. 6.8. Notice that the probability density for 0 < t < t3 is definitely not in steady state: P ([a, bj, t) changes with time. So the rate of change of this quantity, dP ([a, bj, t) jdt, is not zero.

Note that the rate of change of the probability in the region [c, b) is not constant. This change is what we mean by probability flow. Go with the Flow The notion of probability flow is implicit in our qualitative discussion of the change in the integrated probability. We can imagine a \"probability fluid\" that flows into and then out of the detector region. As the amount of probability fluid in [a, b] increases (or decreases), the detector is more (or less) likely to register the presence of a particle. In this quaint picture, probability flows as the state function \\If(x, t) evolves according to the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation. Be careful not to get carried away with this appealing analogy. We use the notion of probability flow to envision rather subtle physical behavior and to cast the equations of quantum mechanics into a form similar to those of other fields: e.g., electricity and magnetism (flow of charge in a wire) and hydrodynamics (flow of gunk in a sewer pipe). But remember that neither the state function nor the probability density actually exists in the laboratory. If anything can rigorously be said to \"flow\" in quantum theory, it is information, for that is the physically significant content of \\If(x, t) and P(x, t) . So take heed: WARNING Thou must not take probability fluid too seriously. Probability fluid does not exist in real space; \"probability flow\" is colorful language designed to create in your mind a picture, an analog of the evolution of a quantum system. With this caution out of the way, we tum to the quantitative incarnation of the concept of probability flow, the probability current density. Introducing the Probability Current Density We've found that a key quantity for describing probability flow is the rate of change of the integrated probability within a finite region [a, bl, d d r b d r dtP ([a,b],t) = dt l; P(x,t)dx = dt l; \\If*(x,t) \\If(x,t)dx. (6.109) To introduce the probability current density, I want to rewrite Eq. (6.109) in a form very similar to the equation we derived in Â§ 6.5 for the rate of change of the integrated probability for infinite interval, Eq. (6.81). Because the little derivation that follows draws heavily on the proof of Proclamation 6.1 (conservation of probability), I want you 216 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion to stop now, go back, and review the algebra leading to Eq. (6.81). The vital point I want you to appreciate is that at no point in the derivation of this equation did we use the fact that the interval was infinite. This observation makes it easy to adapt Eq. (6.81) to the finite interval [a, bl, as required by Eq. (6.109). We just replace the limits -00 and +00 in that equation by the finite values a and b, leaping over mounds of algebra to land on d l b iii. [a a] adt a P(x, t) dx = - 2m w*(x, t) ax w(x, t) - w(x, t) ax w*(x, t) b' (6.110) Look at the structure of Eq. (6.110). Writing it out in full, we find the right-hand side to be the difference of two terms, the first of which is evaluated at the left boundary of the detector region, x = a, and the second at the right boundary, x = b d l b { iii. [* a I a I] }dt a P(x, t) dx = - 2m W (a, t) ax W(x, t) x = a -W(a, t) ax WÂ·(x, t) x=a { i ii. [* a I a * I] } (6.111)- -- W (b,t)-a W(x,t) -W(b,t)-a W (x ,t) . 2m x x=b X x=b This structure suggests that we define a function of x and t to represent these terms. This function is the probability current density: j(x, t) == - ;~ [W*(X, t) aa x w(x, t) - w(x, t) :x w*(x , t)] probability. current (6.112) density Armed with this definition, we can write Eq. (6.111) in a clearer form, which is called the rate equation for probability ftow: ~P ([a, b],t) = j(a, t) - j(b, t) rate equation for probability flow (6.113) Note that 1. the probability current density j(x, t) is evaluated from the state function w(x, t) and, in general, depends on x and on t; 2. j(x, t) is used as in Eq. (6.113) to calculate the rate at time t of probability flow through a finite region . After a brief example, we'll discuss the physical meaning of the probability current density and the rate equation. Question 6-15 To gain familiarity with the definition of the probability current density, show that the following alternate forms of j(x, t) are equivalent to Eq. (6.112): j(x,t) = ~Im [w*(x,t) :x W(x,t)], (6.1140) where Im[ . .. I means \"take the imaginary part of the function in square brackets,\" and j(x, t) = -!..Re [wÂ·(x, t)pw(x, t)], m (6.114b) where p is the momentum operator and Re[ . \" I means \"take the real part of the complex function in square brackets .\" Sec. 6.8 Probability Fluid and Its Flow 217 Question 6-16 True or False: The function -[i1l./(2m)j8P(x, t)/l:Jt is equivalent to the right-hand side of Eq. (6.112). Example 6.6. Probability Current for a Pure Momentum Function The definition (6.112) of the probability current density is rather complicated and abstract. so let's apply it to a very simple function of x and t: a pure momentumfunction .ii Specifically. consider a pure momentum function corresponding to momentum Po = 1l.ko and energy Eo = liwoâ€¢ .T. ( t) - A i( pox - E ot) / h'*'po x , - e . (6.115) [In this example. I won't choose A = 1/V27r1l.. as I did in Chap . 4. Letting A rema in arbitrary frees us to renormalize the pure momentum function in a way that is useful in the study of collisions (see Â§ 6.9).) To evaluate the probability current density for wpo(x, t ). we just substitute the form (6.115) into the definition (6.112) of j(x,t) . obtaining j(x, t) = IAI2 1l.k o . m [for a pure momentum state) (6.116) The probability current density (6.116) for a pure momentum function thus corre- sponds to steady state probability flow. as you can see from the rate equation (6.113). Since the current density is independent of position. i.e.â€¢ j (a, t) = j(b, t) for any finite region [a, bj. this equation becomes d dt P ([a, bj,t) = O. [for a pure momentum function] (6.117) So the integrated probability for a pure momentum state does not change with time and is independent of position. That is. the probability fluid assoc iated with a pure momentum function is homogeneous and uniform . and its flow rate is constant. Please note that the pure momentum function is a very special case; in general the probability current density is a complicated function of x and t-see Pblm . 6.6. Aside: An Artificial Analogy. I remarked above that we can use the proba- bility flow (and its current) to write equations of quantum mechanics in a form similar to those of other fields. To show you how. I'll transform Eq. (6.116). For a pure momentum function . we have 1l.ko = Po, po/m = vg r and IAI2 = P(x, t) . So we can write our expression for the probability current density for this function in the (slightly artificial) way j(x, t) = P(x, t) vg r . This form shows that we can consider the probability current density as the product of a probability fluid density and the flow velocity vg r of this fluid. Similar results are obtained in hydrodynamic and electromagnetic theory . 26This is no mere academic exercise. To see how we might use this function in an application. consider again Fig. 6.6. Suppose that when the particles reach the detector. their wave function is very fat [e.g.â€¢ ~ x(t) is huge for tl ~ t ~ t2 in Fig. 6.7.) Then the momentum distribution of this state will be sharply peaked about the value po = liko (i.e.â€¢ ~p is teeny). To the detector. which can \"see\" only the finite region [a. b]. such a packet looks like a pure momentum function with wave number ko and frequency wo = lik~/2m. For more on modeling a wave packet with a pure momentum function. see Chap. 8. 218 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion To make this example concrete, let's evaluate the probability current density for a beam of electrons in a state that can be approximated by the pure momentum function we investigated in Â§ 5.3, Eq. (5.15): Ili(x,t) = (5.375 x 10 2 m- ! ) exp{i[(4.9 x 1012 m- l ) x - (5.8 x 1018 sec-I) t]} .(6.118) To evaluate j(x, t) for this state, we read off (6.118) the values IAI = 5.375 x 102 m- I/ 2 and ko = 4.9 X 1012 m- I. Inserting these values and the rest mass of the electron, me = 9.109 x 10-3 1 kg, into Eq. (6.116), we get j = 1.639 X 10- 10 sec>\" . (Notice the units.) But What Does the Probability Current Density Mean? At this point, our understanding of the probability current density is based on qualitative, intuitive arguments. Such arguments are fine as far as they g<r-but they don't go far enough. We need a precise physical interpretation. To find one, we'll go back to the rate equation (6.113), integrate it over a finite time interval, and then think about the resulting equation in terms of the Born interpretation and probability flow. This rate equation, ~P([a,bj,t) = j(a,t) -j(b ,t), (6.119) describes the change in P ([a, bj,t) per infinitesimal time element dt. If we integrate this equation over the finite time interval !::i.t == t 2 - tt, we obtain I t2 d I t2 I t2 dtP([a,bJ,t) dt = j(a,t)dt- j(b,t)dt. t) t) t) (6.120) Now, the left-hand side of (6.120) is the integral of a total derivative, so it's just [see Eq. (6.78)] It2d -d P ([a, bj,t) dt = P ([a, bj,t2) - P ([a, bj,t 1 ) . t) t (6.121) Physically, this quantity is the change in the integrated probability in the interval [a, bj during the interval !::i.t. I'll denote this change by the rather baroque symbol !::i.P([a, bj, !::i.t). The resulting time-integrated rate equation (6.120) is the key that unlocks the interpretation of the probability current density: !::i.P ([a, bj, !::i.t) = P ([a,bj,t2) - P ([a, bJ, td I t2 It2= j(a, t) dt - j(b, t) dt. t) t) (6.122) This equation says that the change in the (integrated) probability in the detector region during the finite interval !::i.t is equal to the difference of two quantities. To see what these quantities mean, we must consider what could cause in this change. There are two possibilities: I. probability could flow into [a,b] at x = a; 2. probability could flow out of [a,bj at x = b. Sec . 6.8 Probability Fluid and Its Flow 219 We find on the right-hand side of the integrated rate equation (6.122) a term that represents each of these causes: the first term, Itt,2j (a, t) dt, is the amount of probability that enters the region [a, b] at x = a during the interval D.t. And Itt,2j(b, t) dt is the amount that leaves the region at b during this interval. 27 This way of thinking about (6.122) suggests that we interpret the probability current dens ity j (xo, t) at the point Xo and time t as the instantaneous rate of probability flow in the direction of increasing x. Be sure you understand the directional quality of the probability current density . This feature is implicit in the integrated rate equation (6.122). Suppose, for example, that the change in the integrated probability, D.P ([a, b], D.t), is positive. Then the net probability in the detector region increases during D.t. In this case ftt,2j(a, t) dt must be greater than ftt,2j(b, t ) dt. So in order to make our definition of j(x , t) consistent with Eq. (6.122) , we must ensure that a positive current density corresponds to probability flow in the +x direction. Similarly, a negative probability current density must correspond to probability flow in the -x direction. Summary I began this section by deriving the rate equation for probability flow through a finite region, Eq. (6.113), the mathematical structure of which led us to introduce the probability current density of Eq. (6.112). Then, reasoning from the integrated rate equation (6.122), I argued for an interpretation of j(x , t) that is consistent with this equation and Born's idea of basing the interpretation of quantum mechanical quantities on probability. To summarize our findings, here 's a recap of the key quantities of this section : the instantaneous rate at which position probability j(x, t) = crosses the point x at time t, moving in the +x (6.123a) direction 1 t2 .( t ) dt = the amount of position probability that passes x (6. I23b) t, J x, during the interval D.t = t2 - t 1 You'll find an accompanying summary of the key equations of this section (and of Â§ 6.9) in Table 6.1.

So we needn't worry about probability fluid leaving the detector region at x = a or entering this region at x = b. These cases would be appropriate, however, to particles moving to the left. 220 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion Aside: Pointwise Conservation of Probability. The rate equation (6.119) shows that in general, the probability in afinite region is not conserved (the exception is the pure momentum function of Example 6.6), i.e., d dt P ([a, b), t) # o. (6.124) But by recasting the rate equation in differential form, we discover a mathematical result that proves that probability is conserved at a point: :t P(x, t) + :xj(x, t) = O. pointwise conservation of probability (6.125) This law is the most elemental fonn of the relationship between the probability density and the probability current density. Since we can regain the rate equation (6.119) from this \"pointwise\" form by in- tegrating (6.125) over the detector region [a, b) (see Pblm. 6.1), it makes sense to con- sider Eq. (6.125) as the bottom rung of a \"hierarchical ladder\" of rate equations. These equations are summarized in Table 6.1, which also includes their three-dimensional counterparts from Â§ 6.9. Aside: More on Artificial Analogies. The mathematical structure of the differential equation (6.125) may look familiar from your study of electricity and magnetism. In the physics of the flow of electric charge, the fundamental equation relating the charge at point x and time t, Q(x, t), to the electric current density J(x, t) is a a otQ(x,t) + oxJ(x,t) = 0, (6.126) which bears a striking structural similarity to Eq. (6.125) . The current through a region [a, b] is just 1= J(b, t) - J(a, t) . (6.127) This is the flux associated with this flux of charge. Equations (6.125) and (6.126) belong to an important class of physical relations called equations of conti- nuity.28 6.9 PROBABILITY FLOW IN THE LABORATORY In this section, we'll use the probability current density to describe a beam of electrons in a collision experiment such as the one shown schematically in Fig. 6.9. Laboratories are three-dimensional, so we expect that we'll need the generalization to three dimensions of the one-dimensional equations of Â§ 6.8. But once we have these generalizations in hand, we'll discover that in many experiments we can use their one-dimensional counterparts after all. Beam - Unit area x Figure 6.9 A beam experiment in the laboratory . The beam travels along the x direction perpendicular to the unit area shown ; this unit area plays a key role in the interpretation of the three-dimensional probabil ity current density. Eq. (6.133). 211For a more detailed discussion of this analogy see Â§ 9.3 of An Introduction to Quantum Physics by A. P. French and E. F. Taylor (New York: W. W. Norton , 1978). Sec. 6.9 Probability Flow in the Laboratory 221 The Probability Current Density in 3D There are three essential differences between the situation in one dimension and that in the laboratory . The first concerns the wave function that appears in the definition of the probability current density. In Â§ 6.8, this wave function depended on only one spatial coordinate , z. But a quantum state of a system in three dimensions is represented by a wave function that depends on the three spatial coordinates x, y, and z, so we must calculate the current density from such a function. Second, we must take account of the three independent orthogonal directions in the lab, as specified by the unit vectors ex, ey , and ez â€¢ To describe probability flow in the lab we need three signed quantities: j x(x, t) for flow in the x direction, j y(x , t ) for the y direction , and j z(x, t) for the z direction . Hence the probability current density for a quantum state in three dimensions is a vector: (6.128) Finally, in three dimensions we specify a finite region, such as the one that appears in the rate equations for probability flow, by a finite volume V delimited by a boundary surface S, as shown in Fig. 6.10. ':':'.. / I Figure 6.10 In three dimensions. probability flow is defined in terms of a finite volume V . The surface S bounds this volume. The unit area da of this surface is assigned a direction: normal to and outward from the surface. The arrows outside the volume in this figure symbolically suggest the flow of \"probability fluid.\" [Adapted from Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by R. H. Dicke and J. P. Whillke (Reading. Mass.: Addison-Wesley. 1960).] (6.129) (6. 130a) To generalize the equations of Â§ 6.8, we merely translate them from one to three dimensions, taking into account these three differences. Central to the description of probability flow is the integrated probability inside a finite region, Eq. (6.108). In three dimensions , this quantity is a three-fold integral over the finite volume V , i.e., probability of detection in volume V = P([V), t) = i P (r,t )dv =i Iw(r,tWdv. In this volume integral, dv is an infinitesimal volume element. (For ex- ample, in rectangular coordinates dv = dx dy dz; and in spherical coordinates , dv = r 2 dr sin 9d9dÂ¢.) The definition of the probability current density for the state w(r, t) is the general- ization of Eq. (6.112). The only tricky thing about this generalization is accommodating the dependence of the wave function on r rather than only on x. We accomplish this by replacing the partial derivative a/ax in (6.112) with the gradient operator 'f\"7 .a .a . a v = ex ax + ey ay + ez az' 222 Chap . 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion With this change, the probability current density for a single particle in three dimensions is j(r, t) == - ;~[w*(r, t)Vw(r, t) - w(r , t)Vw*(r, t)] (6. 130b) Finally, we want to generalize the rate equation (6.113) . Here's the one-dimensional equation, with all terms collected on the left-hand side: ~P ([a, b], t) + [j(b, t) - j(a, t)] = O. [the one-dimensional rate equation] (6.131) Look at the quantity in square brackets. It's the difference of two terms. One represents probability flowing out of the one-dimensional \"volume\" [a, b] at x = b; the other, probability flowing into this volume at x = a. If you think of the boundaries of this interval as a one-dimensional surface and examine Fig. 6.10 carefully, you can probably guess the counterpart of this quantity for a three-dimensional system . It's just the surface integral of the component of the three-dimensional probability current density on the infinitesimal element of area cia in this figure. With this modification, the rate equation for a three-dimensional quantum state becomes ~[ P(r, t)dv + isj(r, t) . cia = O. (6.132) Finally, we must generalize our interpretation of the probability current density, Eq. (6.123a). To this end, I want to remind you of how we describe a beam of macro- scopic particles in classical physics. Imagine that the beam in Fig. 6.9 consists of such particles. The particle density for such a beam is the average number of particles per unit length of the beam. But in the classical theory of scattering, the most useful quantity is the classical flux density, the number ofparticles that crosses a unit area perpendicular to the beam per unit time. (The units of the classical flux density are particles/sec-emf.) By calculating the classical flux through a surface, we can quantitatively determine the rate offlow of the particles in the beam. 29 Now, the important aspect of this description for our generalization of the inter- pretation (6.131) is the recognition that in three dimensions we must define quantities related to a current (rate of flow) in terms of a unit area normal to the direction of the current. So for a three-dimensional system , we have the instantaneous rate (at position r and time t) at j (r, t) = which position probability crosses a unit area per- pendicular to the direction of flow. (6.133) To clarify this interpretation and to show how j(r, t) is used in practice, we'll look at a real-world example in a moment. 29For an introduction to fluid flow in classical physics, see Chap. 8 of Mechanics by Keith R. Symon (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1971). The flux density, which is also known as the intensity, is the basis of the definition of the classical cross section. For a clear description of classical scattering, see Â§ 3.10 of Classical Mechanics, 2nd ed, by Herbert Goldstein (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1980), or, if you have the first edition of this classic text, Â§ 3.7. Sec. 6.9 Probability Flow in the Laboratory 223 (6.134) One-Dimensional Probability Flow in Three Dimensions Happily, we usually don't always have to cope with vectors, volume integrals, and gradients when we deal with probability flow in the analysis of an experiment. In many cases, we can use only the x component of j(r, t) and, in fact, can use the equations in Â§ 6.8. The justification for this wondrous simplification rests on the form of the three- dimensional equations we just wrote down and on the physical nature of the beams used in many experiments. Suppose that as particles flow from the source to the target, their beam undergoes very little dispersion along directions perpendicular to its axis of flow. Then we can treat the beam (to a very good approximation) as flowing in one direction only-which, as in Fig. 6.9, we define to be the x axis. This assumption is well within the realm of modem experimental techniques; e.g., in state-of-the-art low energy electron scattering experiments, the dispersion of the incident electron beam is less than three degrees about the beam axis. In this case, the y and z components of j (r , t) are negligible, and we need contend with only i x(r, t) . But this situation does not automatically reduce the equations of this section to their one-dimensional counterparts. The x-component of the probability current density still depends on z, y, and z because, according to Eq. (6.131), it's determined from the wave function w(r, t) , as i x(r, t) = - ;: [w* (r, t) 88 x w(r, t) - W(r, t) 88 x W*(r,t)] . But this expression contains only partial derivatives with respect to x. If we could neglect the dependence of w(r, t) on y and z, then Eq. (6.134) would reduce to the one- dimensional expression (6.112), which would justify our using the equations of Â§ 6.8 without modification. Under certain conditions, neglect of the y and z dependence of the wave function is a very good approximation. Here's an example. Suppose the conditions of the experiment justify our modeling the wave function w(r, t) by the plane wave w(r, t) ::::: A(ko) e i (koÂ·r- wot ). (6.135a) If the beam is well collimated along the x axis, as assumed above, then we can approx- imate ko in (6.135a) by koex . With this approximation, the dot product in the exponent simplifies as ko . r = kox, and the plane wave function depends only on x and t , i.e., w(r, t ) ::::: A(ko) e i (kox- wot ) . (6.135b) So for such a plane wave, the probability current density (6.134) depends only on x and t, and we can fully describe probability flow using the one-dimensional equations of Â§ 6.8. In Example 6.7, I'll apply this model to an actual laboratory situation. Aside: More on the Plane Wave Model. The plane wave function (6.135a) is a good approximation to a very fat wave packet-i.e., one whose amplitude function A(k) is very sharply peaked about the average wave vector ko of the particles in the beam. This requirement is met by a nearlymonoenergetic beam, because the energy uncertainty of the state of the particles in such a beam is very small. This implies a small momentum uncertainty. [Since the particles are free (i.e., non-interacting), these uncertainties are related by !i.p = Jm/(2Eo) !i.E.] And a small momentum uncertainty implies a large position uncertainty: a fat packet. Moreover, if this uncertainty, !i.x, is much larger than the dimensions of the target, then the further 224 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion approximation of (6.l35b) seems reasonable-and it can be justified by rigorous analysis. Example 6.7. A Model Wave Function for a Collision Experiment The most we usually know about a beam in the laboratory is its electrical current and the mean energy E o of the particles in it. For example . in the 1980's atomic physicists can produce nearly monoenergetic beams of electrons of (mean) kinetic energy 0.01 eV in which a current of 3.0 x 10- 5 amp flows through a 1 m2 area perpendicular to the beam'\" To represent the quantum state of the beam in such an experiment by a pure momentum function (6.135b), we must determine from this data the physical quantities that appear in this function: wo, ko, and A o. We can easily calculate the values of Wo and ko from the energy Eo: Wo = Eo = 1.520 x 1014 sec-I. (6.1360) 1'1. And from the momentum, po = J2mEo = 1.708 x 10- 25 kg-m-sec\" ; we get the wave number (6.136b) (6.137) (6.139) po 9 -I ko = 1t = 1.621 x 10 m . (6.136c) All that remains is the amplitude A of the pure momentum function. It's convenient to choose this constant so that P(x , t ) = IAI2 is equal to the relative probability density in the beam. To this end. let's pick IAI 2 to be the average particle density in the beam-i.e., the average number of particles per unit length of the beam that passes through a unit area perpendicular to the beam. With this normalization . we can easily determine IAI from the beam current.P! To do so. we must relate the beam current, which in this example is 3.0x1O- 5 C/sec- 1 to the probability current density J. Then we can easily calculate IAI. because Eq. (6.116) gives us this number in terms of J as A = Jpo~m= ~. Now the electric current I is a measure of the rate of flow of charge in the beam. while j is a measure of the rate of flow of position probability density . In our interpretation for the pure momentum function, J is the number of particles per second incident on a unit area perpendicular to the beam (i.e.â€¢ along the x axis and in the yz plane). In this experiment an electrical charge of 3.0 x 10- 5 C-sec - 1 through a I m2 area in the yz plane. so the number of electrons (of charge q = 1.602 X 1O- 19q corresponding to this current is 3 x 10- 5 j = 1.602 X 10 -1 9 = 1.873 x 10 14electrons/sec. (6.138) If we substitute this value of i. Eq. (6.136b) for Po. and the value of the electron rest mass m e = 9.109 x 10- 3 1 kg into Eq. (6.137), we obtain A = 3.161 X 104 m- 1/ 2 . We can now write down the form of a plane wave that approximates this beam: Il'(r,t) = (3.161 x 104 m- 3 / 2)exp{ i(1.621 x 10 9 m- 1 )x - (1.520 x 10 14 sec- 1 )t }. :lÂ° See H. S. W. Massey. Atomic and Molecular Collisions (London: Taylor and Francis LTD. 1979). :lIThe disadvantage to this choice is that the resulting pure momentum function no longer satisfies the Dirac Delta function normalization condition (4.28). But this is a small price to pay for the convenience of modeling the beam with the plane wave. Sec. 6.9 Probability Flow in the Laboratory 225 As promised, this plane wave depends only on x and t. A final note: I have taken pains in this example to include units on all the physical quantities and in the plane wave (6.139). Newcomers to quantum physics often focus so intently on the equations and functions of the theory that they lose sight of these important dimensional indicators. To help you avoid such waywardness, I've summarized the units of key quantities in Table 6.2. TABLE 6.2 UNITS One dimension Three dimensions State function m- 1/ 2 m- 3/ 2 Probability density m- 1 m- 3 Probability current density sec\"! sec- 1m- 2 Question 6-17 Figure out the units of the state function, probability density, and probability current density of a single particle in two dimensions (e.g., confined to move in a two-dimensional plane). Try to generalize the equations in Table 6.1 to this case. 6.10 FINAL THOUGHTS: QUANTUM CAUSALITY The time-dependent Schrodinger Equation is undeniably one of the great intellectual achievements of science. It laid the foundation on which physicists built our current theories of the physics of matter. Other physicists have performed a vast number of experiments the results of which have verified these theories. Armed with this hindsight, it's interesting to see how the TDSE was initially received. The distinguished physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) has vividly described the attitude of the physics community during the years prior to the publication of Schrodinger's paper:32 \"Physics is very muddled again at the moment; it is much too hard for me anyway, and I wish I were a movie comedian or something like that and had never heard anything about physics!\" From this comment you might guess that Schrodinger's achievement was greeted with cheers. Wrong. Not all members of the physics community expressed delight when confronted with Schrodinger's work. Although Max Planck and the renowned Dutch physicist H. A. Lorentz (1853-1938) waxed enthusiastic over his theory, no less a luminary than Werner Heisenberg, in a letter to Pauli, wrote,33 \"The more I ponder about the physical part of Schrodinger's theory, the more disgusting it appears to me.\" Still, Heisenberg's revulsion notwithstanding, the TDSE quickly dominated quantum theory, eclipsing for a time Heisenberg's alternative, matrix mechanics. 32Quoted in Theoretical Physics in the Twentieth Century. edited by M. Fierz and V. F. Weisskopf (New York: Interscience, 1960), p. 22. 33Quoted in Max Jammer , The Conceptual Development 0/Quantum Mechanics (New York: McGraw- Hill, 1966), p, 272. Writing about Heisenberg's work in a paper in the Annalen der Physik [79, 734 (1926)] Schrodinger comments that he was \"discouraged if not repelled by what appeared to me a rather difficult method of transcendental algebra, defying any visualization.\" 226 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion Now that we have completed our study of the four basic postulates of quantum theory, let's step back momentarily from the mechanics of quantum physics to consider its philosophical implications. In Chap. I, I noted that the new physics of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and Born dealt a severe blow to traditional philosophical tenets such as determinism and causality. But the TDSE restores to physics a strange kind of causality. Before explaining this curious comment, I want to summarize the philosophical situation before the advent of this equation. The notion of cause and effect in the evolution of individual systems was a mainstay of the mechanistic philosophy that dominated the nineteenth century. This philosophy was based on Newton's Laws, but it extrapolated the purview of those laws to the whole of existence. In the 19th century, as today, Newtonian physics described not the whole universe, but rather any closed (i.e., finite) mechanical system. The crucial leap from physics to philosophy was taken by the French astronomer and mathematician (and Napoleon's minister of the interior) Pierre Simon, marquis de Laplace (1749-1827). In his treatise \"Theorie analytique des probabilities\" Laplace ascribed universal applicability to Newton's Laws. Laplace conjured up a super mathematician, armed with total mastery of all math- ematical techniques. He argued that such a mathematician could solve the universe: Knowing the state of the universe at a given instant-the masses and trajectories of all the particles comprising all mechanical systems-and knowing the forces acting on and within these systems, this mythical creature could, according to Laplace, determine the physical properties of all the systems in the universe at any subsequent time. To infinite precision. With certainty. Laplace acknowledged the superhuman-nay, supernatural-power of a creature who could actually solve the universe by calling his super-mathematician a demon. (In contemporary demonology, we might call it an infinite generational computer-the CRAY 9000, perhaps.) To his demon, wrote Laplace, \"nothing would be uncertain, both future and past would be present before its eyes.\" Laplace's point was not that the task of solving the universe was viable, but rather that it was possible in principle. In this philosophical conviction, Laplace was wrong. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle tells us so. This relationship between the inherent indeterminacy in our knowledge of the position and momentum of microscopic particles implies that we cannot specify the precise values of these observables at any instant. So it's impossible to predict the precise subsequent behavior of the system. The Heisenberg Principle casts an impenetrable fog over the line between cause (the initial conditions) and effect (the subsequent evolution) for an individual system and demolishes forever the doctrine of Laplacian mechanism. Henry Margenau has vividly illustrated the consequences of the demise of mecha- nistic causality in his book The Nature of Physical Reality (Woodbridge, Conn.: Oxbow Press, 1977, p. 420): Single events of great magnitude cannot be said to have the picturesque single-event causes which classical mechanics envisaged: even though I know the exact state of a neutron (having a sharp energy) that is capable of setting off an atomic bomb, and know precisely the location of the block of plutonium that is ready to be exploded, I cannot predict whether the disaster will occur. The fate of the globe, as a single event, may hide itself within atomic uncertainty. Sec. 6.10 Final Thoughts : Quantum Causality 227 Yet, all is not lost. 34 Even in the quantum domain, a limited causality applies. After all, the TDSE does establish a causal relationship between the state of a system at the initial time-as described mathematically by the initial conditions {w(x, to): - 00 < x < 00 }-and its state at a later time, w(x, t) for t > to (assuming that the system is allowed to evolve free of measurement). But this is a different kind of causality from that of Laplace's demon. The mechanistic causality of Laplace does not follow from quantum physics be- cause the structure of quantum theory is fundamentally different from that of Newtonian mechanics: the latter theory describes individual systems; the former, ensembles. From the initial probability density P(x, to), we can calculate various probabilistic and statisti- cal data about position at a later time, such as (x) (t) and ~x(t). But these data describe only the results of a position measurement performed on as ensemble of identical systems in the state w(x, t). Quantum physics does not provide a mechanism for predicting the specific outcome of a single measurement on a single system. Indeed, such a measure- ment cannot be described by a theory whose essential elements are interpreted in terms of probabilities. Of course, Laplacian causality is still a viable philosophical stance from which to contemplate the macroscopic world. And perhaps some day, someone will describe the physics of a \"sub-quantum domain\"-a world of sub-microscopic entities over which the HUP does not hold dominion.\" But in the quantum domain-the world of electrons, atoms, molecules, and the like-the only cause and effect relationships are those allowed by the TDSE. ANNOTATED SELECTED READINGS Alternate Approaches to the Schrodlnger Equation One of the best ways to familiarize yourself with new concepts is to read about them from several viewpoints. The Schrodinger equation is so important that you should try to find the time to see how other authors introduce it. I particularly recommend the following: 1. Cropper, William H., The Quantum Physicists and an Introduction to Their Physics (London: Oxford University Press, 1970), Chap. 4. (Available in paperback.) Cropper's approach is historical and his style is delightful. 2. Eisberg, Robert, and Robert Resnick, Quantum Physics of Atoms , Molecules , Solids , Nuclei , and Particles, 2nd ed., (New York: Wiley, 1985), Â§ 5-2. The level of Eisberg and Resnick's eclectic book is lower than this one, and I strongly recommend it as a source of alternative introductions to several of the topics we'll study. 3. Fong, P., Elementary Quantum Mechanics (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1949), Chap. 2. 34Margenau goes on to reassure us that the odds of encountering a neutron with a sharp energy are quite remote and, moreover, that if the energy of the neutron \" is only approximately known, . . . the prospect of its encounter with the plutonium block can usually be predicted with a certainty sufficient for practical men.\" 35David Bohm has elegantly made the case for the existence of a sub-quantum domain in his Causality and Chance in Modern Physics (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1957). This book contains a marvelous. largely non-technical discussion of the problem of causality. I highly recommend it. 228 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion Differential Equations Many of the \"math methods\" books listed in the Reading Lists for Chaps. 4 and 5 contain fine introductions to the theory of differential equations. Here are some good sources for more complete and specialized treatments: 4. Hildebrand, Francis B., Advanced Calculus for Applications (Englewood Cliffs , N. J.: Pren- tice Hall, 1962), Chaps . I, 3, and 4 of this wonderful book discuss ordinary differential equations; Chaps. 8-10 contain most of what you should know about partial differential equations. 5. Coddington, Earl A., An Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations (Englewood Cliffs , N. J.: Prentice Hall, 1961). This book treats only ordinary equations, but it does that well. 6.

Berg, Paul W., and James L. McGregor, Elementary Partial Differential Equations (San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1966). Finally, I should mention an invaluable source for the intrepid differential equations solver: 8. Murphy, George M., Ordinary Differential Equations and Their Solutions (New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., 1960). This book, which has unconscionably been allowed to go out of print, not only contains a splendid summary of methods for solving ordinary differential equations, it also includes tables of solutions to hundreds of such equations.

EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS the main thing, however, is the algorithm!\" Any child knows that! What's a beast without an algorithm?\" -Trurl in \"The Second Sally\" from The Cosmic Carnival of Stanislaw Lem by Stanislaw Lem This chapter's collection includes the usual practice exercises and straightforward ap- plications of the material in the chapter you just studied. In addition, I've thrown in a couple of problems that ask you to work with the stationary-state wave functions for the infinite square well, which we're going to derive in the next chapter, an application of the probability current density to a practical (laboratory) situation, and a couple of Exercises and Problems 229 fairly challenging puzzles at the end. The last problem in this set is probably the hardest yet-but it's worth your time. Exercises 6.1 A Possible State Function for an Oscillator The potential energy of a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator of mass m and natural frequency w is V(x) = ~mw5X2. Here (adapted from Chap. 9) are the normalized wave functions that represent the ground state and first excited state of this system: ( ) 1/ 4o -or 2 / 2 - iE l t/I;- e e tt (6.l.la) (6.1.l b) (6.1.2) In these expressions, 0 is a real constant and En is the real energy of the n th state. Each of these functions satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation of the system. Now, consider the function W(x, t) = vh [5Wl (x , t) + 6iW2(X, t)] . [a] Is Eq. (6.1.2) a valid state function for the system-i.e., does it satisfy the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation? Justify your answer either with a derivation or a complete, rigorous argument. Is it normalized? Prove your answer. [b] Suppose we need to evaluate the energy uncertainty ~E(t) = J(E 2) - (E)2 . Con- sider the task of evaluating (E 2 ) . In Chaps. 5 and 6 we developed two operators that can represent the observable energy: the Hamiltonian it. and the energy operator E = i h8 / 8t . So we should be able to evaluate (E 2) using either it. or E, i.e., (E 2) I:w * (x , t)it.2w(x , t) dx (E 2) =I:w*(x ,t)E2w(x,t)dx (6.l.3a) (6.1.3b) Use the time-dependent SchrOdinger equation to prove rigorously that these two forms are equivalent, i.e., prove that (6.1.4) (6.2.1) 6.2 A Lorentzian State Function Consider a free particle of mass m in one dimension. Suppose the momentum probability amplitude of the initial state (i.e., the state at t = 0) is 4>(p) = If e T 1pl, where a is a real, positive constant and, of course, Ipl is the absolute value of the momentum variable p. [a] Show that the initial wave function w(x ,O) is 230 Chap. 6 ~ 2a W(x,O) = -2 -2--2 7r a + x A Quantum Equation Of Motion (6.2.2) Hint: w(x , 0) is real. Subsequent parts of this problem will be easier if you express it as a real function. Here's a bonus hint:_{-p ps 0 Ipl - + > 0P p_ (6.2.3) By the way, you can work most of the rest of this exercise even if you can't do this part. [b] What is the parity of w(x , O)? What is the ensemble average of position in this state at t = O? Justify your answer. {c] Evaluate the mean value of the momentum (at t = 0) for this state. To do so, first write down two expressions for this quantity-one in terms of the amplitude function 4l(p), the other in terms of the initial wave function w(x,O) and the momentum operator jJ in the position representation. Now, choose one of your expressions and evaluate it. Hint : Draw a sketch of 4l(p). [d] In this part we consider the state at t > 0 that evolves from this initial state. Describe in words and equations two ways to determine w(x , t) for t > o. In your discussion, include (but do not try to solve) all relevant equations and set up (but do not evaluate) all necessary integrals. (You'll have lots of opportunities to solve equations and evaluate integrals in the problems below.) [e] Show that the ensemble average of the energy at t = 0 is fl,2/4ma2. Hint: You can evaluate this quantity either from 4l(p) or w(x, 0), so your first step on this part should be to write down expressions for the mean value of the energy in terms of each of these functions. Then think carefully about which one will be easier to evaluate and use the easier expression. Problems 6.1 Normalization-and Other Like Matters In Question 6.6 in Â§ 6.5 you showed that the normalization integral for a state function w(x, t) is independent of time, i.e., that once a state function is normalized (e.g., by the procedure in Â§ 3.5) it stays normalized: I:WÂ·(x,t o)W(x,to)dx = 1 ===> I:WÂ·(x ,t)w(x,t)dx = 1 for all t > to. (6.1.1) (If you didn 't answer Question 6.6, please do so now. Then press on.) [a] The equation that describes the propagation of a classical wave r(x ,t) in one dimension has the form 8 2 1 ~ -82 r(x , t) = -2- 8t 2 r(x, t) x V p h (6.1.2) where Vph is the phase velocity of the wave. This equation is second-order in time. By contrast, the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for a free particle, Eq. (6.30), includes s first-order time derivative . Now, suppose things had been different: suppose the TDSE had the form of the wave equation (6.1.2)-i.e. , with a second-order time derivative in it. Would the normalization of the solutions of such an equation necessarily be independent of time-i.e., would Eq. (6.1.1) hold if the TDSE had the form of Eq. (6.1.2)? Prove your answer. [b] In applications of quantum mechanics to problems in atomic and molecular physics, one frequently must evaluate integrals of the form s=I:wi(X,t)W2(X,t)dx, (6.1.3) Exercises and Problems 231 (6.1.4) where WI (x, t) and W2(X, t) represent two physically-realizable quantum states. Such integrals are called overlap integrals. (They arise primarily in the calculation of wave functions for atoms and molecules.) Evaluating overlap integrals would be an intolerable chore if these integrals had to be evaluated at each time . Show that the integral S is independent of time-i.e., show that d ( >0 â€¢ dt L oowdx , t)w:z(x, t) dx = O. Hint: Use the Principle of Superposition and the answer to Question 6.6. 6.2 The Principle of Superposition: A Non-Stationary State The normalized wave functions and corresponding (well-defined) energies for the ground and first-excited states of a particle of mass m whose potential is an infinite square well of length L are WI(X,t) II cos (1ryJ e- i E 1t / \" E I = ;;~22 W2(X,t) = II sin (21rL) e- i E 2 t / \" E2 = ~:~: = 4EI According to the Principle of Superposition, the linear combination w(x,t) = CIWI(X,t)+C2W2(X,t) , (6.2.la) (6.2.lb) (6.2.2) (6.3.1) where CI and C2 are arbitrary complex constants, represents a state of this system . But, unlike the energies of the states represented by WI(x, t) and W2(x, t), the energy of the state represented by w(x, t) is not well-defined. Moreover, the probability density Iw(x, t)1 2 depends on time: this state is non-stationary. [al Actually, the constants CI and C2 are not truly arbitrary, because the constraint that w(x , t ) must be normalized imposes a limitation on them . Derive the relationship between CI and C2 in Eq. (6.2.2) that must be satisfied if the wave function of the superposition state is to be normalized. [bl At time t > 0 we perform an ensemble measurement of the total energy of the particle whose state is represented by w(x , t). Derive an expression for the average value we would obtain in such a measurement. Express your answer in terms of E I , E2 , CI, and C2. [cl Prove that E I < (E) (t) < &. Does (E) depend on time? [dl In some studies of nuclear physics, a proton in a nucleus can be modeled by a particle (with the mass of a proton) in an infinite square well of width L, where L is chosen to be a sensible approximation to the size of a nucleus . The \"motion\" of such a proton is often described in terms of a \"charge distribution\" eP(x , t), where e is the proton charge and P(x , t) the quantum-mechanical posit ion probability density, that oscillates at the same frequency as P(x, t). Now, suppose the state of the proton is represented by w(x , t) in Eq. (6.2.2) with Cl = C2. Calculate the frequency (in Hz) of a proton in a nucleus of dimension L = 10 f. 6.3 More Explorations of States of the Infinite Square Well Here is yet another state of the particle in a box (the infinite square well). The state represented by W(x ,t) = .Jr, [cos (1rL) e- i E 1t / \" + sin (21rL) e- i E 2t / ,, ] is a superposition state constructed from the wave functions that represent two of the states in the previous problem. In this problem, we'll use our understanding of operators and the Schrodinger equation to further investigate these three states. 232 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion [a] In Example 6.1, I proved that WI (x , t) satisfies the TDSE. Do the same for W2(X, t) and w(x, t) . [b) Evaluate the expectation value of momentum (P) (t) for the state represented by w(x, t) . Write your answer as a real function involving E I , E2 , L, and fundamental constants. Briefly discuss the time dependence of your result and contrast it to the time dependence of (x) from Pblm. 3.2. [c) Evaluate the position and momentum uncertainties for W2(X, t). (If you worked Pblm. 3.2, you can get one of these from your answer to it.) Calculate the uncertainty product (~xh(t)(~ph(t) and verify that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is satisfied for this state. [d) Suppose that at some time t > 0 we perform an ensemble measurement of the energy of the system in the superposition state represented by w(x , t). Evaluate the average value of the energy that would be obtained in such a measurement. Does your answer depend on time? Now evaluate the uncertainty in the energy for this state. Comment on the physical implications of the fact that (~E)(t) > O. Hint: You can evaluate the (E) (t) using either it or E. In this case, using the latter operator will greatly simplify the algebra. 6.4 Probability Flux in a \"Real World\" Example Protons are widely used in high-energy collision experiments. For example, consider a beam of (noninteracting) protons travelling in the +x direction. How might we represent the state of the protons in this ensemble? WeU, if we are willing to surrender all information about the position of the particles in the beam (~x = 00), we can approximate their state function by a pure momentum state of the form (6.135b). In experiments to study the physics of subatomic particles, counters are used that actually measure the probabilityflux j(x, t) as counts per second. Typically, the cross-sectional area such a counter presents to a particle beam is 0.2 m2 â€¢ An important step in understanding such an experiment is writing down a state function to represent the particles in question. For obvious reasons, we prefer to use the pure momentum function model, rather than a complicated wave packet, when such a model is justified physically, Consider a beam of protons with 2.7MeV of kinetic energy. Suppose our counter measures 4300 counts per second. Write down an explicit expression for a pure momentum function that models the wave function of a particle -in this proton beam. (Explicitly include the values of A, ko, and wo.) 6.5 More Properties of the Gaussian Packet In Â§ 6.7 we investigated the phenomenon of wave packet spreading and showed that it led to considerable changes in the Gaussian wave function as time passes. But, in spite of spreading, the wave packet retains one characteristic until its ultimate total dispersion in the t --+ 00 limit. The state function is a Gaussian at all times: once a Gaussian, always a Gaussian. [a] Use this peculiarity of the Gaussian wave packet to predict, without resort to graphical or algebraic methods, one final property of this free-particle wave function: its peak amplitude, the value of w (x, t) at the center (x) (t), decreases with time. Use these two facts: [I] w(x , t) remains normalized at all times; [2] w(x , t) spreads, so the region of x that is encompassed by ~x(t) grows. Hint: If the area under the probability curve P (x , t) remains equal to 1 while the width of this curve grows, what must happen to the peak value of w(x , t)? [b) Now show that this behavior is a consequence of the multiplicative prefactor in the wave function, by graphing this factor as a function of time. Exercises and Problems 233 (6.6.1) 6.6 The Probability Current Density for a Wave Packet In Example 6.6 I evaluated the one-dimensional probability current density for the simple case of a plane wave function. Our result, the constant in Eq. (6.116), was delightfully simple and, alas, quite atypical of quantum states. For a more realistic example, consider the Gaussian wave packet (6.98) for ko = 0, [ 1 ] 1/ 4 [ 1 x 2 (1 - i:dTI-t) ]\\Ir(x t ) = exp __ 2mL '21TÂ£2(1+ i 2':L2t) 2 4L2 1+ 4SL4t2 . Derive the following expression for the probability current density for this wave packet: Hint: You'll find it useful to define two intermediate quantities that are independent of x: a= (6.6.3a) b= _1_ (l-i~t) - 4Â£2 1 + ,,2 t2 4 m 2 L 4 (6.6.3b) Write the wave packet and its complex conjugate in terms of a and b and evaluate the partial derivatives you need to determine i . One more thing: remember that the complex number b can be written as b =Re b + i 1mb. 6.7 A Martian Wave Packet In this chapter, we considered the evolution of a free particle wave packet: i.e., its propagation and spreading with time. Let's see what happens when we try to apply these ideas to a (rather large) macroscopic particle. Consider the planet Mars as a particle, the motion of which is to be described by a quantum mechanical wave packet. Suppose that at t = 0 (the birth of the universe) the width of the packet was 0.01 m-a ridiculously small number on an astrophysical scale. Now, neglecting the gravitational field of the sun, calculate the increase in the width of this packet from its birth (about 5 billion years ago) to the present. 6.8 A Probability Amplitude for Particle Propagation The TDSE is the partial differential equation that must be satisfied by all wave functions of whatever system we're studying. To obtain a particular wave function, we solve this equation subject to the initial conditions {\\Ir(x, to): - 00 ::; x ::; oo} appropriate to whatever state we're interested in. We can make clearer this vital dependence of the wave function at any time t > to on the function \\Ir(x, to) by looking at the TDSE from a different point of view. In this problem, we'll show that \\Ir(x,t) is related to its initial condition by \\Ir(x ,t) =I:K (x ,t;x' ,to)\\Ir(x',to)dx'. (6.8.1) The critter K(x,t ;x',to) in this expression is called the propagator.i\" [a] We've already developed the machinery to derive Eq. (6.8.1). In our study of wave packets (in Chap. 4) we discovered that such a wave function can be written as an integral over pure momentum functions 36Actually, K( x ,tjx' ,to) is called the retarded propagator because it is zero for t::; to. 234 Chap. 6 A Quantum Equation Of Motion i.e., as a wave packet \\II (x t) = _l_e i [px-E(p )tl/\" p , J27fn \\II(x, t) =I:~(p)\\IIp(X,t) dp. (6.8.20) (6.8.2h) The function ~(p) is the momentum probability amplitude. We calculate this amplitude, in tum, from the initial wave function \\II(x, to) using the Fourier transform relationship (here written for to = 0) ~(p) = ~ roo \\II(x, 0) e- i px / \" dx. (6.8.3) v27fn L; Now, by substituting this expression for ~(p) into Eq. (6.8.2b), demonstrate that \\II(x, t) can be written as an integral over the initial function , as in Eq. (6.8.1). Also, develop the folIowing integral expression for the propagator K(x , t j x', to) in Eq. (6.8.1). [Write your propagator as an integral over p including E(p) in the time-dependent factor . For convenience, let to = 0.] K(x,t ;x',O) = 2~nl:eXP[-i(X'-X)~-iE~)t] dp. (6.8.4) [b] Now consider the free particle, for which you know the dispersion relation E(p). Eval- uate the integral in your propagator and thereby obtain the folIowing analytic expression for the free-particle propagator: K (x, t;x' , 0) = (- 2~\";J1/ 2 exp [i(x -2~tm]. [for a free particle] (6.8.5) [c] FolIowing Max Born 's ideas , we interpret the wave function \\II(x' , to) as a probability amplitude for finding the particle in an infinitesimal region dx' about x' in a position measurement performed at to. Similarly, we interpret \\II(x, t) as the position probability amplitude for the time t > to. These statements, in tum, suggest an interpretation for K(x, t ;x!, to). Discuss the interpretation of the propagator as a probability amplitude and the physical significance of Eq. (6.8.1) . [d] One of the (many) important properties of the propagator is its simple \"initial value\"- i.e., at t = to. Prove that K(x ,O;x',O) = 6(x' - x), (6.8.6) where 6(x' - x) is the Dirac Delta function (see Â§ 4.2) . How would you interpret this result physicalIy? [e] The propagator also satisfies a differential equation that looks suspiciously like the TDSE: [in:t -1i(x,P)] K (x , t;x' , to) = iM(x - x')6(t - to), (6.8.7) where 1i is the Hamiltonian of the system. For the free particle, of course, 1i = T. Verify that your free particle propagator (from part [b]) satisfies Eq. (6.8.7) . Any function that satisfies a differential equation of this form- i.e., with a Dirac Delta function on the right-hand side-is calIed a Green's function; so you have just proven that the free-particle propagator is just a particular kind of Green 's function. Remark: To keep the algebra in this problem as simple as possible, I've asked you to consider only the propagator for a free particle. But Eqs. (6.8.1), (6.8.6), and (6.8.7) also hold for a particle with a non-zero potential. If the particle is not free, it is sometimes easier to obtain the propagator by solving Eq. (6.8.7), subject to the (reasonable) boundary conditions: K(x,t ;x' ,tn) = 0 for t ~ to.

No, there are still difficulties, but the outline of the plot is clear and will develop itself more clearly as we proceed. -M. Rozer to Lord Peter Wimsey in The Nine Tailors by Dorothy L. Sayers In 1926 Erwin Schrodinger published four papers that laid the foundation for the wave theory of quantum mechanics. The time-dependent Schrodinger Equation (Chap. 6) was the subject of the second of these papers. In the first, Schrodinger introduced a simpler time-independent equation, which is usually derived from the TDSE. The reason for this apparent inversion of natural order lies in Schrodinger's back- ground. From research early in his career on the physics of continuous media, Schrodinger knew well the mathematical properties of the special class of equations called eigenvalue equations. The time-independent Schrodinger Equation (TISE) belongs to this class, so Schrodinger was primed to discover it first. In this book, we are following the logic of mathematics, not history, so we began with Schrodinger's time-dependent equation, as codified in Postulate IV. From the TDSE, it's but a short hop to the time-independent Schrodinger equation. The solutions of the latter are functions of position but not of time; they describe the spatial dependence of an important class of quantum states called stationary states. These states playa vital role in quantum physics, even though they are rarely found in nature. For any microscopic system, however complicated, the essential problem of quan- tum theory is the same: Given the system Hamiltonian H--the operator that mathemati- cally represents the system-solve the TDSE for state functions that fit prescribed initial conditions . These conditions are usually established by experimental circumstances at the initial time. In many cases, the initial state is non-stationary. But non-stationary states are too complicated mathematically to be obtained directly from the TDSE. Sta- tionary states provide a way out of this predicament, for they are the building blocks of non-stationary wave functions (Chap. 12). In prior examples and problems, I've shown you wave functions for a few station- ary states. All stationary-state wave functions have a common, simple mathematical form: lIt(x, t) = (function of x) (function of t) . stationary state (7.1) The time-independent Schrodinger Equation determines the function of x in a stationary- state wave function. Not all microscopic systems have stationary states-but most do. In Â§ 7.1, we'll deduce the conditions under which these states exist and will derive equations for the functions of x and t that comprise their wave functions. Then in Â§ 7.2, we'll solve the time equation and, in the process, discover one of the characteristics of a stationary state: its energy is sharp. We can dig this and other properties out of the mathematical character of the TISE, which we'll probe in Â§ 7.3 and 7.5. In Part III, we'll solve the TISE for several important one-dimensional systems and in Volume II will tackle systems in three dimensions and many-particle systems. As the number of dimensions and particles increases, the mathematical contortions we must perform to solve this equation become more complicated. But, happily, I can show you 237 the basic steps in its solution in the context of a very simple example: the particle in a box. We shall solve this problem (at last) in Â§ 7.4 . As you plow through this example, and others in chapters to come, be careful to not lose sight of the special nature of stationary states. In general . quantum states are non-stationary. The beautiful and powerful connection between stationary and non- stationary states is so important that it gets its own chapter (Chap. 12)-but I'll provide a sneak preview in Â§ 7.6. 7.1 IN SEARCH OF SEPARABLE WAVE FUNCTIONS It is easy to see why solving the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation for an arbitrary system is so hard. Even for a single particle in one dimension, this equation is rather formidable: (7.2) (7.3) The underlying problem is not just that it's a partial differential equation of second-order in x and first-order in t, but that we must contend with both of these variables at once . We cannot solve for the x dependence of the state function without taking account of its t dependence, because in general x and t are inextricably linked in the potential energy function V(x, t) . As a consequence, the space and time dependence of a wave function may be very complicated. We have seen one example of this complexity in Â§ 6.6: the Gaussian free-particle state function (6.98) is an involved mixture of x- and t-dependent factors: 'l'(x, t) ~ [2~Â£'(1+ i 2:Â£,t)T t /' [ 1 (x - Po t) 2 1 xe i(kox-wot) exp --2 m/i â€¢ 4Â£ (1 + i 2m Â£2 t)J Only the comparative simplicity of the free -particle TDSE lets us solve this equation analytically. Strategy: separation of Variables One way to subdue recalcitrant multi-variable differential equations is to seek solutions that have a particularly simple form. We know that wave functions must be complex functions of x and t; and we might guess that the simplest such solutions are of the product form (7.1): l1I(x, t) = 1/1(x)(t). [stationary state1 (7.4) I have let the lower-case Greek letter psi (1/1) represent the x dependence of 111(x , t), and zeta Â«() its t dependence. Mathematicians call such product functions separable solutions of the partial differential equation (7.2); we quantum mechanics call them stationary-state wave functions. 238 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters The idea of basing quantum theory on stationary states sounds good, but it raises several questions. Do separable wave functions exist for all physical systems? If not, for what kinds of systems do they exist? For such systems, how can we get our hands on the \"pieces\" 'l/J(x) and ((t)? Arid for these systems, how are the stationary-state wave functions related to the more general non-stationary wave functions? These are the focal questions of this chapter. The separable form (7.4) implies that we can solve for 'l/J(x) and ((t) separately. To do so, we must derive from the TDSE an equation for 'l/J(x) that does not depend on t and a separate equation for ((t) that does not depend on x. This is the goal of the mathematical method called separation of variables, to reduce a partial differential equation in several variables to separate, simpler equations. We have no guarantee that this method will succeed for the TDSE, but it's worth a try. To apply this strategy , let's substitute the separated form (7.4) into Eq. (7.2) and try to isolate on one side of the resulting equation all terms that depend on x and on the other, all terms that depend on t. That is, we are going to try to reduce the TDSE to an equality between two single-variable algebraic expressions: 88 2 88 2 terms in x, 8 x ' 8 x2' . .. = terms in t , 8 t ' 8 t2' . . . . (7.5) If such an arrangement is possible, then the expressions on the left and right sides of (7.5) must each equal a constant and this equation will separate (aha!) into two ordinary differential equations, one in z, the other in t. separation of Space and Time in the TDSE Optimistically assuming that a solution of the form (7.4) exists, we write the TDSE (7.2) as ~ ~ 8 - 2m 8 x2'l/J(x)((t) + V(x, t) 'l/J(x)((t) = in8t 'l/J(x)((t). (7.6) We can simplify (7.6) by exploiting the t-independence of'l/J(x) and the z-independence of ((t) to transform the partial derivatives into ordinary derivatives, viz., [ n2 d 2 ] [d ]((t) - 2m dx 2 'l/J(x) + V(x, t)'l/J(x)((t) = 'l/J(x) indt ((t) . (7.7) (7.8) To begin arranging (7.7) in the form (7.5), let's divide both sides by the product lI1(x, t) = 'l/J(X)((t):l 1 [ n 2 d 2 ] 1 [ d ] 'l/J(x) - 2m dx2 'l/J(x) + V(x ,t) = ((t) indt ((t) . Equation (7.8) is almost separableibut in quantum mechanics, almost isn't good enough. In general, the potential energy can depend on x and t, and, if it does, our grand strategy fails, for we cannot further separate Eq. (7.8). lyou may be worried that t/J(x) might be zero for some value of x; at such an x, the factor l/t/J(x) is infinite and Eq. (7.8) ceases to make sense. Don't fret. Division by t/J(x) is an intermediate step in this derivation, designed to clarify the logic of separation of variables. We shall soon restore t/J(x) to its rightful position-see Eq. (7.10a). Sec. 7.1 In Search of Separable Wave Functions 239 Okay; let's scale down our ambitions: Rather than try to find separable state functions for any quantum system, let's consider a system whose potential energy depends only on position variables. If V in the TDSE depends only on x, then Eq. (7.8) has the magic form (7.5), i.e., 1 [ n 2 d 2 ] 1 [ d ] .,p(x) - 2m dx2 t/J(x) + V(x) = ((t) indt ((t) (7.9) Comes now the crucial step. Think about Eq. (7.9): how could the left hand side- an expression in x that is independent of t~qual the right-hand side-an expression in t that is independent of x? Answer: only if both sides are independent of x and t. We can therefore equate each side of (7.9) to a constant-say, 01: Doing so, and rearranging terms slightly, we obtain two separate equations: and n 2 d 2 - 2m dx2 t/J(x) + V(x).,p(x) = OI.,p(X) in:t ((t) = OI((t). (7.lOa) (7. lOb) For obvious reasons, mathematicians call 01 the separation constant. Great. Equations (7.10) are ordinary differential equations-(7.lOa) is second- order in z, (7.lOb) is first-order in t-and as such are much easier to solve than the TDSE. These two single-variable equations are equivalent to the TDSE for a product wave function l{1(x, t) = .,p(x)((t), i.e., for a stationary state. The fact that we can obtain such equations at all, provided V does not depend on t, proves that stationary- state wave functions exist for systems with a time-independent potential energy. We'll spend the rest of this chapter poking and prodding at Eqs. (7.10). But a couple of important features leap out at us immediately. First, although we can solve these x and t equations separately, they are not completely independent of one another: they are linked by the separation constant 01. Second, the x equation (7.lOa) contains the system Hamiltonian; indeed, we can write this equation as H.,p(x) = OI.,p(X). [Since H is an operator that represents the total energy (Chap. 5), you may suspect that 01 is the value of this observable in the stationary state. You would be right-see Â§ 7.2]. The spatial function t/J(x) therefore depends explicitly on the system we are studying- i.e., on details of its potential energy. But the time equation (7.lOb) does not contain H: by solving this equation, we find, once and for all, the time dependence of any stationary-state wave function for any system! Equation (7.lOb) is refreshingly simple, and you can probably guess the solution (see Â§ 7.2). The x equation (7.lOa) is a bit more formidable; it is the subject of much of the rest of this book. Conservative Systems The derivation of Eqs. (7.10) shows that the nature of the potential energy determines whether or not stationary states exist: V independent of t stationary states exist 240 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters A system whose potential energy is time-independent is said to be conservatlve.f So the vital point to remember is Rule Stationary states exist only for conservative systems. To study a non-conservative system (which is not, incidentally, called a \"liberal system\") we must deal with the TDSE directly, a challenge we'll take up in Volume II. The microscopic universe is full of conservative systems. Isolated atoms, molecules, and solids are conservative, as are many collision complexes formed by scattering a mi- croscopic particle-an electron, say-from one of these targets. The class of conservative systems does, however, exclude some important problems, e.g., those in which a time- dependent external field is present. (Lasers fall into this category.) For example, in Volume II we'll probe the quantum states of a microscopic particle of charge q exposed to a time-varying external electric field of magnitude E and frequency w. We'll find that the Hamiltonian of the particle in such a field is li? 82 'H = --- - qÂ£xcoswt. (7 .11) 2m8x 2 The time dependence of the potential energy -qÂ£x cos wt renders the TDSE for this problem inseparable, so stationary states for a particle in a time-varying electromagnetic field do not exist.i' You may recall from classical physics an important conservation law for a conser- vative macroscopic system: if the forces on the system are conservative, then its energy is conserved, i.e., energy is a constant of the motion. In the next section we shall discover the form this law takes for microscopic systems. 7.2 TIME AND ENERGY In Â§ 7.1, I noted that the time equation (7.l0b) is independent of the system's potential energy. This simple, first-order ordinary differential equation is easy to solve, and its solution has some surprising physical consequences. The Time Factor for a Stationary-State Wave Function To solve Eq. (7.lOb), I'll invoke a standard tnck from the theory of ordinary differ- ential equations-one you'll find in the books in Â§ II of the Suggested Readings for 2This nomenclature is taken from classical physics, where a system is conservative if the forces on it are such that the work done around a closed orbit is zero. Any conservative force is derivable from a potential energy that is independent of time-hence the connection between the classical and quantum definitions of a conservative system. If the forces acting on a classical particle are conservative , then the energy of the particle is conserved. For more on conservat ive systems. see Â§ I-I of Classical Mechanics, 2nd ed. by Herbert Goldstein, (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley. 1980). 300 not conclude from this example that the mathematical technique separation of variables necessarily fails if the potential energy depends on time. If, for example. V(x , t) happens to be the sum of two terms, one of which depends only on x, the other of which depends only on t, then we can determine separable solutions to the Schrtidinger Equation. Sec. 7.2 Time and Energy 241 Chap. 6. This trick is based on the logarithmic derivative of a function. By definition, the logarithmic derivative of a function ((t) is (7.12)logarithmic derivative of ((t) dId dtIn((t) = ((t)dt((t). We can write Eq. (7.lOb) in terms of the logarithmic derivative of ((t) by simply moving ((t) to the left-hand side, viz., 1 d ia ((t) dt((t) = -h' If we use the definition (7.12) and then integrate the result from 0 to t, we have rt i.In((t')dt' = _ ia r dt'. Jo dt Ii Jo 'Tis now an easy matter to evaluate both sides of (7.14); to wit ((t) io In ((t) -In ((0) = In ((0) = -h t . (7.13) (7.14) (7.15) To obtain the time function, we just exponentiate both sides of (7.15) viz., ((t) = ((O)e- io t / n. (7.16) Question 7-1 Verify by direct substitution that the function in (7.16) solves the time equation (7.l0b). The factor ((0) in (7.16) is just the initial condition for the differential equation (7.lOb). It is convenient to pick ((0) = 1, so that the general form of a stationary-state wave function is4 lIt(x, t) = 1/J(x)e-io t / n. [stationary state) (7.17) We've accomplished a great deal with very little work: we have found the functional form of the time factor for any stationary state of any system . Isn't that terrific?! Yes, except for one little thing: what is the meaning of a? Question 7-2 You can anticipate the answer to this question by applying a problem-solving gambit called dimensional analysis: The exponent in (t) must be dimensionless, so what must be the dimension of o? Now, what observable do you think 0 stands for? Identifying the separation Constant The Born interpretation of lit(x, t) provides a clue to the physical significance of the separation constant a. According to Postulate II, this function is the amplitude of a probability wave. And now, in Eq. (7.17), we've discovered that for a stationary state, this wave oscillates at frequency a/Ii. 4This choice entails no loss of generality. The physically relevant initial condition is the one on lJt(x, t), i.e.â€¢ the function lJt(x,O). The choice (0) = 1 allows us to specify this initial condition in terms of the spatial function, i.e., lJt(x,0) = 'IjJ(x). 242 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters But wait a minute. From the de Broglie-Einstein relation E = luÂ», we already know the \"oscillation frequency of a particle\": if E is the particle's energy, then this frequency is EIn. To make our time function (7.17) consistent with this fundamental relation, we interpret Q as the total energy of the particle in the state represented by this function. With this identification, the general form of a stationary state wave function becomes (7.18)[stationary state]I \\lI(x, t) = t/J(x)e- iEt/ h IÂ· At this point, we know only the time dependence of \\lI(x, t). We determine the (al- lowed) values of the energy and the spatial dependence of \\lI(x, t) by solving Eq. (7. lOa) . Replacing Q by E , we can write this equation as5 TISE (7.19) This is the time-independent Schredtnger Equation. Since the energy E appears explicitly in this equation, its solutions will depend on the value of this parameter. That 's why I labeled the spatial function with E. We have discovered that the energy of a stationary state is well-defined (sharp). Indeed, we can simply read the value of E off a stationary-state function of the form (7.18), such as Eq. (6.23) for the ground state of the infinite square well. In Â§ 7.5, we'll build a rigorous foundation under this observation by proving that .6.E = 0 for a stationary state. The essential result of this chapter (so far) is: if a microscopic system is conser- vative, then there exist special quantum states of the system , called stationary states, in which the energy is sharp. This important result is the quantum mechanical counterpart of the classical law mentioned at the end of Â§ 7.1: the energy of a conservative macroscopic system is a constant of the motion.\" Buoyed by our success with the time equation, we're ready to tackle the spatial equation , the time-independent Schrodinger Equation . 7.3 A PROFILE OF THE TISE \"So did I,\" said Pooh, wondering what a Heffalump was like. -Winnie the Pooh by A. A. Milne The TISE for t/JE(X) in a .stationary state of energy E, Eq. (7.19), can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian H as \"Only for bound states does the TISE determine the allowed energies. As we'll see in Chap. 8, for convenience, we admit to quantum mechanical problem-solving continuum stationarystates. These functions are not rigorously admissible, but they are valuable models for the study of collisions of microscopic particles. The energy of a continuum state need not be determined by solution of the TISE. 6In quantum mechanics an observable Q is said to be a constant of the motion if its expectation value does not change with time for any state (see Chap. II). Sec. 7.3 A Profile of the TISE 243 I H:I/JE(X) = Et/JE(X) I TISE (7.20) [Be careful not to use t instead of E in (7.20). What a difference a little hat makes!] Because il = T + V, the explicit form-and hence the solutions-of this differential equation depend on the potential energy V(x). For example, the potential of a particle of mass m in a uniform, one-dimensional gravitational field with gravitational constant 9 is mgx, so the TISE for a particle in such a gravitational well is (7.21) (7.22) (7.23) Another important example is the simple harmonic oscillator: if Wo denotes the natural frequency of the oscillator, then the potential energy of the oscillator is mw5x2/2. The TISE for this system is therefore [ n? d 2 1 ]---d2 + - mw5x2 t/JE(X) = Et/JE(X), 2m x 2 To lay a foundation for our study in Part III of these and other systems, we'll here scrutinize the general TISE, much as we did the TDSE in Â§ 6.3. We'll put on our mathematician's hat for awhile and try to deduce general mathematical properties of Eq. (7.20). In particular, we're going to investigate the mathematical structure of this equation, the normalization condition for its solutions, limitations on normalizable solutions and the implications of these limitations for the energy of the stationary state, and, finally, a new mathematical property called degeneracy . The TISE Considered as an Eigenvalue Equation For a single particle in one dimension, the TISE is a second-order, ordinary differential equation in the variable x. It's linear and homogeneous and has two distinct (i.e., linearly independent) solutions.\" Because it is of second order, the TISE requires two boundary conditions . These are just the boundary conditions on the state function W(x, t) that we discussed in Â§ 6.3; for a stationary state, they show up as conditions on the spatial function t/JE(X) , For example, the spatial function for a state in which the particle is bound by a potential well must satisfy the conditions t/JE(X) ----+ O. Ixl-oo The TISE is a differential equation of a very special type; it contains a parameter- the energy E-that appears in a specific way. Look at the structure of (7.20): a differen- tial operator (il) operates on the unknown function [t/JE(X)] to produce, not a different function of x, but rather the same function, t/JE(X), times the parameter E. Mathe- maticians call an equation of this form an eigenvalue equation and say \"t/JE(X) is the 7 A reminder: Two functions Ii (x) and [z (x) are said to be linearly independent if the equation C1 Ii (x) + C2 h(x) = 0 is satisfied only by ci = C2 = O. That is, two functions that are proportional to one another are linearly dependent. A common instance of linearly dependent functions in the quantum mechanics of conservative systems is two spatial functions tPt(x) and 1/J2(X) that differ only by a a global phase factor ei6 â€¢ These functions are not distinct. and physically they represent the same quantum state. (Remember from Chap. 3 that state functions are indeterminate to within such a factor.) 244 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters eigenfunction of the differential operator it, and E is the corresponding eigenvalue.\" Thus, when feeling mathematically inclined, I may refer to the spatial function 1/JE(X) as the Hamiltonian eigenfunction. ' The TISE is by no means the only important eigenvalue equation in quantum mechanics, and in Chap. II we shall consider such equations in their own right. For now, though, let's stay with the TISE. Aside: The TISE in 3D. The fonn of the TISE for a single particle in three dimensions-or, for that matter, for a many-particle three-dimensional system-is identical to (7.20). Such equations differ, of course, in the number of independent variables. For example, the TISE for a sinfle particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential V(r) = mwor2/2 is (7.24) where the Laplacian '\\72 is given in Eq. (6.17). Notice that, unlike the one-dimensional TISE (7.20), Eq. (7.24) is a partial differential equation. Normalization of the Spatial Function For a function 111(x, t)-stationary or otherwise-to be valid, it must, of course, satisfy the TDSE of the system . But this function must also satisfy the additional demands of Â§ 3.5: it must be single-valued, continuous, and smoothly varying . And, finally, it must be normalizable . That is, it must be possible to scale the function so that its normalization integral equals one: i:111*(x,t)lI1(x, t) dx = 1. (7.25) If the state is stationary, then each of these conditions on lI1(x, t) translates into a condition on the Hamiltonian eigenfunction 1/JE(X). The resulting normalization condition is particularly simple, because the time factor in a stationary state wave function is the exponential function e- iEt/ h. The integrand in the normalization integral (7.25) is 111*(x, t)lI1(x, t). The required complex conjugate is 111*(x ,t) = 1/JE(x)e+iEt/ h, (7.26) so the product 111*(x, t)lI1(x, t) becomes 1/JE(X)1/JE(X). Hence the normalization condition on the wave function reduces to a similar condition on the Hamiltonian eigenfunction,\" (7.27) We can therefore normalize spatial functions using the same procedure we applied to the time-dependent wave functions in Â§ 3.5. Notice that the requirement (7.27) rules out \"exponentially exploding\" spatial functions, such as those in Fig. 7.1a. 8We need the complex conjugate of t/JE(X) in (7.27) only if this function is complex. A real, single- variable ordinary differential equation has real solutions. Moreover, a solution that satisfies boundary conditions such as (7.25) is unique to within the usual global phase factor. Thus, when studying bound states of a one- dimensional system, we're always at liberty to use real spatial functions. Such solutions are desirable, because they are easier to work with than complex solutions. Note that even if t/JE(X) is real. the wave function is complex, because the spatial function must be multiplied by the complex time factor.

The oscillatory function in (c) does not properly go to zero in this limit. but we admit it to quantum theory as a useful model (see Chap. 8). The disappearance of the time factor in the product wÂ· (x, t)w(x, t) is a common incident in quantum mechanics. Most important quantities involve products containing the wave function and its complex conjugate . If such a product is present-and if the wave function represents a stationary state-then this cancellation will eliminate the time dependence (see Â§7.5) Existence of Normalizable SpatialFunctions You may be wondering, \"If I am given a value of E, can I be assured that a normalizable solution of the TISE for that energy exists?\" 246 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters (7.28) In general, no. To be sure, Eq. (7.20) can be solved for any value of E-using a host of mathematical and numerical methods (see Part III}-but normalizable solutions of this equation can be found only for certain values of E. Even if the number of nonnalizable solutions is infinite, their energies form a discrete list. That is, between any two valid energies Ei - 1 and E i , there are an infinite number of \"invalid energies,\" invalid because for values of E in the interval Ei- 1 < E < Ei the solution 'l/JE(X) blows up as [z] -+ 00. Several such offenders appear in Fig. 7.1a. Thus the requirement that the spatial functions be nonnalizable leads inexorably to quantization of energy. Only for special \"allowed\" energies do physically admissible stationary state functions, with spatial functions that satisfy the TISE and boundary conditions such as (7.23), exist. One of the most powerful corroborations of quantum theory is the fact that these energies and only these energies are ever found in energy measurements on microscopic systems. In Â§ 7.4, we'll work an example that illustrates how boundary conditions lead to energy quantization. Uniqueness and Degeneracy Suppose we have found an energy E for which a nonnalizable solution 'l/JE(X) to the TISE exists. Might there be other, distinct solutions for this energy, or is this solution unique? The answer depends on the nature of the system we are studying. A solution of any second-order. single-variable differential equation that satisfies two boundary conditions is unique. 9 There follows from this mathematical fact a uniqueness condition: Rule Bound-state solutions to the TISE of a one-dimensional single-particle system are unique. This rule establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the quantized energies of a one-dimensional single-particle quantum system and its bound stationary state wave functions: valid quantized energy E Â¢::::::> unique \\lI(x, t) = 'l/JE(x)e-iEt/ h [bound state in one dimension] We describe this property by saying that a bound state energy E is non-degenerate. The simple correspondence (7.28) does not necessarily apply to more complicated quantum systems. For example, in studying a microscopic particle in three dimensions, we'll find stationary-state energies to which there correspond more than one distinct spatial function. Such energies are said to be degenerate. In the jargon of quantum physics, a stationary state energy that has n distinct spatial functions is said to be n-fold degenerate. Example 7.1. Stationary States of a Free Particle In Chaps. 4-6 we exhaustively investigated a function of separable form, the pure momentum function 1o . 9Seeâ€¢ for example , An Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations by Earl A. Coddington (Engle- wood Cliffs. N. J.: Prentice Hall, 1961.) lOHere, as in Â§ 6.8, I'll leave A arbitrary. If we want to ensure Dirac Delta function normalization, as in Chap. 4, we can always choose A = l/\"f'i;h. Sec. 7.3 A Profile of the TISE 247 (7.29) The corresponding energies are given by the free particle dispersion relation w(k) = hk 2/(2m) as [for a free particle] (7.30) [for a free particle] The spatial dependence of the pure momentum function (7.29) is t/JE(X) = Aeipx/ Ii â€¢ This function satisfies the time-independent Schrodinger equation for a free particle, h2 d 2 - 2m dx2 t/JE(X) = Et/JE(X), (7.31) (7.32) if E is given by (7.30). But the spatial function (7.31) has several peculiar features, the most obvious of which is that it does not obey the boundary conditions (7.23). Question 7-3 By substituting the function t/JE(X) in Eq. (7.31) into Eq. ,<7.32), derive Eq. (7.30) for the corresponding energies. This failure comes about because, rather than decay to zero, the function eipx/Ii oscillates between +1 and -1 as [z] -> 00. Consequently the spatial function (7.31) is not normalizable, i.e., we cannot scale it to obtain a function that satisfies the condition (7.27). This property of the pure momentum function means that it's not physically admissible- although it's nonetheless useful as a model of a fat wave packet. Two properties of the energies (7.30) follow from the impossibility of normalizing these functions. First, the energies are not quantized; all values E > 0 are allowed . [Re- member : quantization follows from boundary conditions like (7.23), which the free-particle spatial functions do not obey.] Second, these energies are degenerate. In fact, for any value of E > 0, we can easily find two distinct solutions of (7.32). One of these solutions is (7.31); its x dependence is eipx/Ii â€¢ And there is a second solution that is proportional to e- ipx/ Ii â€¢ It's easy to see from the free-particle energies (7.30) why there are two distinct spatial functions for each energy. These functions depend on the energy through their dependence on p. But two values of p correspond to each value of E, i.e., p = +v'2mE and p = -v'2mE. So each energy E> 0 is twofold degenerate. Because of this degeneracy, the notation in (7.31) is inadequate: it does not tell us which linearly independent solution for energy E we are talking about. We can, however, fully specify a particular spatial function by appending a superscript (+) or (-) to t/JE(X): t/Jk+)(x) = Aeipx/ Ii t/Jk-)(x) = Be-ipx/ Ii â€¢ (7.33a) (7.33b) The state functions t/Jk+)(x)e-iEt/ 1i and t/Jk-)(x)e- iEt/ 1i represent an ensemble of free particles of energy E moving in the +x (p = v'2mE) or -x (p = - v'2mE) direction , respectively . An interesting consequence of the existence of two linearly-independent spatial func- tions for a single value of E is that we can easily construct other solutions to the TISE for this energy, such as 248 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters (7.34) (7.36) where A and B are complex constants. In fact, since A and B are arbitrary, we can construct in this wayan infinite number of additional solutions. This flexibility is often useful in problem solving. For example, we can pick A and B in (7.34) so that this linear combination is real, e.g., A = B = f ===} \",,~)(x)= Ccos (~x) (7.350) A = -B = ~ ===} \",,~)(x)= Dsin (~x). (7.35b) [The (+) and (-) superscripts of (7.33) are not appropriate to the new spatial functions of (7.35), so I have labelled these functions by (e) and (0) to indicate their parity (even or odd). I'll explain this apparently quixotic choice of notation in Â§ 7.4.] These choices provide real, rather than complex, spatial functions. Note carefully that the flexibility afforded us by degeneracy is not a general property of the stationary states of a single particle in one dimension. For example, to any valid bound state energy, there is but one spatial function. In the next section, we'll study an example of just such a situation. 7.4 A PARTICLE IN AN ESCAPE-PROOF BOX Most of the important properties of stationary states and the steps we carry out to obtain their wave functions appear in the solution of a very simple problem: the particle in a box. The potential energy of such a particle, which is shown in Fig. 7.2, is { 00 -00 < x < _lL V(x) = 0 -~L:::; x :::; +~2L . 00 +~L < x < 00 Because this potential is infinite at the walls of the box, all state functions must obey the boundary conditions (Â§ 6.3) \\l1(x = -~L, t) = 0 w(x = +~L, t) = O. (7.37a) (7.37b) And, since V = 0 inside the box-the only region in which the wave functions are non-zero-the Hamiltonian there is just the kinetic energy operator, So in this region, the TISE is r,,2 d2 - 2m dx2 tPE(X) = EtPE(X) [- ~L< x < ~L] . 2 - - 2 [-~L< x < ~L] 2 - - 2 (7.38) (7.39) In this section, we'll solve this equation and explore key properties of the resulting stationary states. In earlier examples, we investigated the wave function for the ground state of this system : the stationary state with the minimum total energy. The value of this energy (which we'll derive in this section) is Sec. 7.4 A Particle in an Escape-Proof Box 249 +00 X~O t Center of symmetry -x Figure 7.2 The Infinite Square Well. Note the center of symmetry at the midpoint of the box. the point x = O. (7.42) 1f' 21i? E 1 = 2mÂ£2' (7.40) And, in Example 6.1 (Â§ 6.2), we proved that the corresponding time-dependent function, Wl(X,t) = ficos (1f'I) e-iElt/h [-~L::;x::; ~L], (7.41) satisfies the TDSE for this system. The function Wl(X, t) clearly has the characteristic form 1/1E(X) e- iEt/h of a sta- tionary state, with spatial function 1/1E1 (x) = fi cos (1f'I) . And it's easy to verify that this function satisfies the time-independent Schrodinger equation of this system, Eq. (7.39), with E = E 1 given by (7.40). But in practice we must be able to obtain this spatial function-and those for all the other stationary states-by solving the TISE. We need a game plan. I'm going to layout and then illustrate a systematic strategy for solving the TISE for the bound-state spatial functions and energies of anyone-dimensional system. The particular algebraic machinations required to solve this equation depend, of course, on the particular potential energy-but this overall strategy does not. There are only three steps: Step 1. Write down the general solution to the time-independent Schrodinger Equa- tion. Step 2. Apply the boundary conditions imposed by the potential energy to the general solution of Step I. Step 3. Normalize the bound-state spatial functions from Step 2. It is the second step-imposition of the boundary conditions-that leads to quantization of the energies of the stationary states, as you'll see in the following example. Example 7.2. The Stationary States of a Particle in a Box Since the particle is free inside the box (where V = 0), we could simply write down a general solution to the TISE in this region as a linear combination of the complex expo- nential functions for a free particle in Eqs. (7.33). I prefer. however, to use the alternate, equivalent real trigonometric functions cos(pxjn) and sin(pxjn) . Because they are real, these functions are easier to work with than their exponential cousins. Here, then, is a general solution to the TISE in the region where the spatial functions are non-zero: 250 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters 1/JE(X) = CCOs(~X) +Dsin(~x) . (7.43) Note that the momentum and energy are related by p = J2mE . At this stage, the constants C and D in this linear combination are arbitrary, and p and E are unconstrained-e.g., the energy can take on any value greater than zero. That's step 1. Following our three-step procedure, we now implement the boundary conditions (7.37). Let's start at the right wall (x = +~L). Applying condition (7.37b) to the general solution (7.43), we get Ccos(~~)+Dsin(~~) = O. (7.44) How can we pick C and D to enforce this requirement? We certainly can 't choose C = 0 and D = 0, for this choice would imply that 1/JE (x) = 0, the position probability density is zero everywhere, and there is no particle . And there is no value of p such that both the sine and cosine functions in (7.44) are zero, because sine and cosine are linearly independent functions . Evidently we must set one and only one of the arbitrary constants equal to zero-- either C = 0 or D = O. To ensure that the remaining sine or cosine function in (7.44) is non-zero, we must constrain the argument of this function . Here are the two possibilities: or C = 0 (D ~ 0) D = 0 (C ~ 0) and and sin (~~) = 0 cos (~~) = o. (7.45a) (7.45b) In either case, the resulting spatial functions will obey the boundary condition at the right wall, Surprisingly, they will also obey the boundary condition at the left wall. Question 7-4 Argue from the symmetry properties of the spatial function (7.43) that a solution of the TISE that satisfies (7.37b) must also satisfy (7.37a) . Now apply the boundary condition at the left wall (7.37a), to the general solution (7.43). Show that you obtain the same restrictions on C , D, and p, Eqs. (7.45). The requirements (7.45) imply that valid spatial functions for the particle in a box exist only for values of p such that the sine or the cosine of pL/(2Ti) is zero. The zeroes (or nodes) of these trigonometric functions occur at discrete, equally spaced values of their argument: cosO = 0 sinO = 0 for for 11' 311' 511' 0= 2'2'2' '' ' 0= 0,11',211', ... . (7.460) (7.46b) Applying Eqs. (7.46) to the functions in (7.45), we see that lI . (P L) __ 0 I'f 211'Ti 411'Ti 611'Ti sm h2 p = L'L 'L' (7.47a) cos (~~) = 0 if 1I'Ti 311'Ti 511'Ti P=Y'L'L' (7.47b) 11 Although sin II = 0 for II = 0, we exclude p = 0 from (7,47b) , because the only zero-energy solution of (7.39) corresponds to the uninteresting case 1/J(x) = 0 (no particle) . The TISE for E = 0 becomes rf21/J(x)/dx 2 = O. The solution of this equation that is continuous at the walls is 1/J(x) = ax + b, and this solution can satisfy the boundary conditions (7.37) only if a = b = 0, i.e., if 1/J(x) = O. For more on this point see the articles by M. Bowen and 1. Coster , Amer. Jour. of Phys ., 49,80 (1981) and by R, Sapp, Amer. Jour. of Phys. SO, 1159 (1982). Sec. 7.4 A Particle in an Escape-Proof Box 251 (7.47c) Equations (7.47) imply that the momentum of the particle in a box is quantized; i.e., spatial functions that satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by the potential exist only for discrete values of p in the list p = {~n,2~n,3~n,4~n,...}. We can conveniently index these values by introducing a positive integer n = 1, 2, 3, and writing (7.47c) as 7rn PÂ» = n L for n = 1,2,3,.. . . [for the infinite square well] (7.48) Notice that each allowed value of the momentum corresponds to one and only one type of spatial function: either to Eq. (7.47a) [for n = 2, 4, 6, . . . ] or to Eq. (7.47b) [for n = I, 3,5, .. . J. Since E = p2j(2m), these restrictions on p imply restrictions on E; to wit: the allowed stationary-state energies of a particle of mass m in a box of width L are for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . [for the infinite square well] (7.49) Our derivation of Eq. (7.49) exemplifies an extremely important general principle of bound states: Rule The two boundary conditions imposed by the potential energy that confines a particle to a finite region of space (in a bound quantum state) force quantization of energy. But what about the spatial functions? We discovered [Eqs. (7.45)] that these functions come in two types. To write these down explicitly, let's use (7.48) for Pn in Eq. (7.45): TYPE I: TYPE II: 1/1~)(x) = Ccos (P;x) } or 1/1~e)(x) = Ccos (n7rf) 1/11;')(x) = Dsin (P;x) } or 1/1~o)(x) = Dsin (n7rf) n = 1,3,5, ... n = 2,4,6, . .. (7.50a) (7.50b) In Eqs. (7.50) I've introduced two labels on the spatial functions: a subscript nand a superscript, (e) or (0). The index n is called a quantum number. Notice that once we know n, we know the values of the energy [Eq. (7.49)] and the momentum [Eq. (7.48)] for the corresponding stationary state. The superscript indicates the parity of the function. All TYPE I functions are even, and all TYPE II functions are odd, 1/1~o)(-x) = -1/1~o)(x) [n = 1,3,5, .. . ) [n = 2,4,6, .. . ). (7.5Ia) (7.5Ib) 252 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters Notice that we can accommodate both types of spatial functions with a single index, since each n = 1, 2, 3, .. . corresponds to one and only one type: odd values to cosine functions [Eq. (7.50a], even values to sine functions [Eq. (7.50b)]. Step 3 of the solution of the TISE is to normalize the spatial functions. Let's do the odd-parity functions first. From Eq. (7.27), the normalization condition ist 2 +L/2 1 = J 'I/J~o)'(x)'I/J~o)(x)dx n = 2,4,6, . . . (7.52) -L/2 +L/2 = IDI 2 J sin 2 (mri) dx (7.53) -L/2 = IDI2~. (7.54) We might as well choose D to be real so the spatial functions will be real. We conclude that all the odd-parity eigenfunctions are normalized by the same factor, D = J2/ L . Remarkably, this factor also normalizes the even-parity spatial functions. Question 7-5 Consider the normalization of the even-parity functions and verify the claim in the last sentence. That is, show that to normalize 'I/J~e)(x) ofEq. (7.50b), we use C = J2/L. The fact that the same normalization constant can be used for all spatial functions is a peculiarity of the infinite square well. In general, normalization constants are different for different stationary states. To summarize our findings, here are the normalized spatial functions for the particle in a box: JIcos (mri) JIsin (mri) n = 1,3,5, . .. n = 2,4,6, . . . (7.55) For each spatial function, the corresponding energy is given by Eq. (7.49). If we want to highlight the variation in energy with n, we can write En in terms of the ground state energy E t , as 1r21i? E = n 2 Et with E, = -- n 2mL2 [for the infinite square well] (7.56) These energies are sketched in Fig. 7.3. Diagrams such as this one are called, sensibly, energy-level diagrams. The list of allowed stationary-state energies is called-by spectro- scopists, among others-the energy spectrum. The full time-dependent wave function for each stationary state is easily constructed from the spatial functions (7.55), as wn(x, t) = 'l/Jn(X)e-iEnt/h . (7.57) t2Watch the limits of integration; the spatial function is zero outside the box, so the integrals run not from -00 to +00 but rather from -L/2 to +L/2. To evaluate the integral in (7.53), just change the dummy variable of integration from x to u = nnÂ»]L.

For convenience, I've plotted the (first six) stationary-state energies in units of Et [see Eq. (7.56)]. Beside each energy is the symbol of the corresponding spatial function. For example, the first three such functions are II1t (x , t ) = ~ cos ( 1TI)e-iEtt/h (7.58a) ,T, (t) Ii , (2 X) - i E 2 t / h '1'2 x, = V[, sin 1T[, e (7.58b) 1I13 (x , t ) = ~ cos (31TI) e-iE3t/h E3 = ~:~:, These fellows are displayed along with their probability densities in Fig. 7.4. Remarkable Symmetries (7.58c) As we relax, feet up, drink in hand, reviewing the results of our first quantum triumph, we notice an interesting pattern in the stationary-state spatial functions of Fig. 7.4: as the energy En increases, the functions t/Jn(x) alternate parity, beginning with the even ground state t/J~e)(x). This pattern is typical of stationary-state spatial functions for one- dimensional potentials that are symmetric with respect to a center of symmetry. To see what I'm talking about, have another look at this potential in Fig. 7.2. The center of symmetry of a potential is the point on the x axis with respect to which V(x) is even. In Fig. 7.2, the midpoint of the infinite square well is its center of symmetry. That is, if we define this point as the origin of coordinates, x = 0, then the function V(x) is symmetric with respect to inversion through this point, the symmetry operation x 1-+ -x. This is the definition of a symmetric potential: 254 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters 1/!3(X) \"\"X\"'~ ~ x x t 1/!2(X) \"\"XI\"~ ~ x x \"'XI~. t x \"\"X\"'l~ ~ x FIgUre 7.4 Spatial functions and corresponding probability densities for the n = 1. 2. and 3 stationary states of the infinite square well.

V( -x) = V(x). symmetric potential (7.59) In Fig. 7.5a you'll find a few other symmetric potentials. These examples differ in a visually obvious way from those in Fig. 7.5b, which do not have a center of symmetry. As you might guess, these unfortunates are called asymmetric potentials. Why am I making a big deal out of the symmetry of the potential? Simply because the symmetry properties of a system (i .e., of the potential energy of the system) has great power to simplify problem solving in quantum mechanics and to aid us in gaining profound insight into the physics of physical systems. For example, shortly (Â§ 9.4) we'll prove that the pattern in Fig. 7.4 pertains to all symmetric potentials: Rule All bound-state spatial functions of a one-dimensional system with a symmetric potential have definite parity. For such a system, the ground state is even, and the higher-energy functions alternate parity with increasing energy. As we apply quantum mechanics to various systems, in Part III, you'll see how greatly this simple, seemingly magical rule eases the algebraic (and, in complicated problems, numerical) difficulties that confront us. Sec. 7.4 A Particle in an Escape-Proof Box 255 V(x) x (a) V(x) x V(x) x (b) V(x) x Figure 7.5 Examples of (a) symmetric and (b) asymmetric one-dimensional potentials. Shown in (a) is the harmonic oscillator potential V(x) = rm.J~x2/2 and a symmetric finite square well, and in (b) an anharmonic oscillator (the Morse potential) and an asymmetric square well. The symmetry of the potentials in (a) markedly simplifies the chore of calculating their spatial functions. Question 7\",,(, Repeat my solution of the TISE for the particle in a box, starting with a linear combination of complex exponential functions, (7.34). Show that you wind up with the same spatial functions (7.55), albeit after a bit more work. Question 7-7 Suppose that in setting up the TISE for the particle in a box, we had chosen the origin of coordinates (x = 0) at the left wall, rather than at the midpoint of the well. What are the spatial functions in these coordinates? (Hint: Solve this problem two ways; first by directly solving the TISE, and second by implementing a change of variable x ~ x - L/2.) Why is this choice of origin a bad idea? Aside: An Introduction to Curvature Arguments. It isn't hard to understand the alternating parity of the spatial functions of the infinite square well. The key to such insight is a mathematical property of each function called its curvature. The curvature of 'l/JE{X) is simply its second derivative, d2'I/JE(X)/dx2. (Loosely speaking, this quantity describes how rapidly the function \"turns over\" as x changes.) The TISE shows that the curvature of 'l/JE{X) is related to the value of E, since d 2 2m dx2'l/JE{X) = -\"h2E 'l/JE(X). So the greater the curvature of 'l/JE(X), the greater the magnitude of E. Now, of the spatial functions in (7.55), the one with the smallest curvature is V2/Lcos(1rx/L). 256 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters (This function fits half of a cosine wave into the box.) So it is the spatial function of minimum energy. The function with the next smallest curvature fits a full sine wave into the box. And so forth. The Stationary State of Minimum Energy Of the many non-classical features exhibited by the particle in a box, perhaps none is more striking than that it is never at rest. A particle at rest in a region of zero potential energy would have zero total energy. But we've just proven [see Eq. (7.56)] that the minimum allowed energy for a particle in a such a region-inside the infinite square well-is greater than zero. What causes this incessant motion? The potential is zero, so no forces act on the particle (except the impulsive forces at the walI). Therefore the non-zero kinetic energy of the particle in the infinite square well must be due to the simple fact that it is confined to a finite region. This astonishing conclusion is quite contrary to any classical intuition we may still be carrying around. Although this result felI out of our solution of the TISE for the infinite square welI, it hinges on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. To appreciate the essential connection between this principle and the non-zero minimum energy of a confined particle, let's consider an ensemble of identical particle-in-a-box systems, each in the stationary state with the minimum alIowed total energy. We'll pretend that we don't know the value of this energy, which I'll calI E minâ€¢ The question is: could E min be zero? What do we know about the energy? Since the state of the members is stationary, its energy is sharp. So all members have the same value of the energy, Em in' which they exhibit in an energy measurement. The ensemble average and uncertainty in the measured energy are (E) = E m in and t1E = O. (7.60) To argue that the minimum energy must be positive, we need to look briefly to a differ- ent observable, position . From position, we'lI return to momentum via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and thence to the energy. The position probability densities graphed in Fig. 7.4 show that in this stationary state, position is not sharp-i.e., the position uncertainty t1x is positive . But neither is t1x infinite, because the particles can't escape from their boxes. So, without performing any calculations, we can put upper and lower bounds on the position uncertainty: 0< t1x s L . [for the particle in a box] (7.61) These limits imply that the momentum uncertainty in this state must be positive, because, according to Heisenberg, t1x t1p ~ n/2. (RecalI from Example 5.6 that the momentum uncertainty for the ground state is t1p = 1rn/L .) Now, think carefulIy about what t1p > 0 implies about the individual results of the ensemble measurement: they must fluctuate about the mean momentum, (p). [For this stationary state, the magnitude of the mean momentum is related to Emin by (P) = Pmin = y'2mEm in' ] But if various individual results differ from one another, then at least one member must exhibit a non-zero momentum, [p], The energy of this member is IpI2/(2m) > O. But since t1E = 0, alI members of the ensemble have the same (sharp) energy, E min â€¢ We conclude, therefore, that E m in, the smalIest possible sharp energy of a particle in an infinite square well, must be positive. Sec. 7.4 A Particle in an Escape-Proof Box 257 Question 7-8 Thought Question: Consider an ensemble of particle-in-a-box systems in an arbitrary state-i.e., one that is not necessarily stationary. In an energymeasurement, can any member of the ensemble exhibit the value E = O? Why or why not? Aside: Uncertainty and Quantization. Does the non-zero momentum uncertainty for stationary states of the infinite square well seem to contradict Eq. (7.48), which gives the quantized values of Pn? It doesn't, really, because momentum is a directed quantity. Equation (7.48) specifies the magnitude of Pn, but not its direction. To see the significance of the directed nature of momentum, we need only note that each function (7.58) is a linear combination of two travelling waves moving in opposite directions. For example, we can write the ground-state spatial function as 'l/JI(x) =ffJ (e i n / L + e-in/ L ). So the momentum in such a state is not sharp, even though its magnitude is well defined. Question 7-9 Deduce the value of (P)n for any stationary state of the particle in a box. (Hint: Think, don't calculate, and re-read the above aside if you have trouble.) The infinite square well is beloved of quantum pedagogues (such as your author), because it provides an algebraically simple problem that illustrates general problem- solving strategies and a host of quantum phenomena. And, as you'll discover as you solve the problems at the end of this chapter, it's a surprisingly good model of many \"real-world\" microscopic systems. Still, the particle in a box is artificial in two noteworthy respects. First, potential differences in the real world may be very large, but they are never infinite . Second, real potentials are never discontinuous, as is the infinite square well at the walls . Because of these features, the spatial functions of the infinite square well are discontinuous at the walls-a difficulty that in the real world never rears its ugly head. 13 7.5 A CLOSER LOOK AT STATIONARITY In Â§ 7.3 we explored the mathematical properties of stationary states and the equation from whence they come, the time-independent Schrodinger equation. In this section we'll focus on the physical properties of these states and, in particular, on the meaning of the adjective \"stationary.\" Colloquially, this word means unmoving, static, time-independent. So let's investigate the time-dependence of the quantities that describe a bound stationary quantum state: the expectation value, uncertainty, and probability density. The probability density for an arbitrary state P(x, t) = \\}I(x, t)\\}I*(x, t) does depend on time. But for a stationary state, this quantity is trivially time-independent, because the exponential factors in the wave function \\}I(x,t) = tPn(x)e-iEnt/n and its complex conjugate cancel : 13These discontinuities have generated considerable discussion in the pedagogical literature of quantum physics. including one paper with the marvelously ominous title \"The Particle in a Box Is Not Simple.\" by F. E. Cummings. Amer. Jour. of Phys. 45, 158 (1977). See also D. Home and S. Sengupta . Amer. Jour. of Phys. SO, 522 (1982). 258 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters (7.62) Be not misled: although the probability density doesn't change with time, the wave function does. The point is that the time-dependent factor in the wave function is just a global phase factor, and (Chap. 3) all state functions are arbitrary to within such a factor. So \\It(x, t) and \\It(x, 0) represent the same physical state . In this light, it's not surprising that all measurable properties of such a state are time independent. The time-independence of \\It* \\It plays a vital role in evaluating statistical quantities for a stationary state. For an arbitrary quantum state (one that is not stationary), these quantities for an observable Q do depend on time (see Â§ 5.6): (Q) (t) = i:\\It*(x, t)Q\\It(x, t) dx. (7.63a) (7.63b) But does this time dependence persist if the state represented by \\It(x, t) is stationary? To find out, let's return to the observable we've been investigating in this chapter. The Energy From our calculations on the stationary states of the infinite square well (Â§ 7.4), we conclude that for these states, the quantities (7.63) do not depend on time. Their values are (E)n = En (aE)n = 0 [nth stationary state1 (7.64) (7.65) I want to show you now that this time-independence is a general property of stationary states . Example 7.3. The Energy of a Stationary State For Q= H and w(x, t) = 1/Jn(x)e-iEnt/\\ the ensemble average (7.63a) of the energy is (E)n =i:1/J;(x)e+iEnt/hH1/J,,(x)e-iEnt/h dx . The Hamiltonian for a conservative system, â€¢ h2 d2 'H. = - 2m dx 2 + V(x), (7.66) does not alter a function of time such as e- iEt/ h, so the time factors in this expectation value cancel, leaving the time-independent value (E)\" =i:1/J;(x)H1/J\" (x) dx. (7.67a) This proves that the time-independence seen in (7.64) for the infinite square well holds for the stationary states of any conservative system. It also proves the generality of the relationship between the (E) and the allowed energies in (7.64). To see this, we just apply the TISE, H1/Jn(x) = En1/J,,(x), to (7.67a) to get Sec. 7.5 A Closer Look at Stationarity 259 and use the normalization integral (7.27) to conclude (7.67b) I (E)n = E\" I [nth stationary state] (7.68) The same reasoning applies to the uncertainty which, according to (7.68), is simply (7.69) (7.70) In the expectation value (E 2 )n' the time factors cancel, just as they did in (7.67a), leaving 1 00 2 * '2 (E ) n = -00 'l/Jn(x)'H 'l/Jn(X) dx. (7.71) Applying the TlSE twice to 'l/Jn(x) (and remembering that the product of two operators means successive operation), we can simplify the integrand in (7.71), to wit: ie'I/Jn(x) = if:H'l/Jn(x) = En if.'l/Jn(X) = E~'l/Jn(x). So the mean value (7.71) is just and from (7.70), the uncertainty in any bound stationary state of any system is (7.720) (7.72b) [nth stationary state] (7.73) Question 7-10 In Chap. 6, I noted that the Hamiltonian is equivalent to the operator t = i1iiJ/[}t -indeed, we can write the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in operator form as if. =e. Consequently, we should be able to evaluate the expectation value and uncertainty of the energy for any quantum state either from if. or from i. e.g., (E)n = (Â£) n =I: W*(x,t)tw(x,t)dx. Derive Eqs. (7.68) and (7.73) for a stationary state using t rather than if.; e.g., show that 260 Chap . 7 (Â£) n = En Simplifying Matters and (~Â£)\" = O. Further Generalizations, Other Operators What made the evaluation of (E) and of (LlE) for a stationary state so trivial was the special relationship between the Hamiltonian and the wave function for such a state, i{if1n = En \\lin. This simple relationship doesn't apply to an arbitrary operator Q, and evaluating these statistical quantities for an arbitrary observable does require some algebra (see the multitude of examples in Part III). But we can easily generalize the proof in Example 7.3 that (E) and LlE for a stationary state are time-independent to an arbitrary observable. Suppose the observable Q doesn't explicitly depend on time. The expectation value (7.63a) for the nth stationary state is (7.74) Look at the time factors in this equation. Regardless of the form of Q, these factors cancel, leaving a time-independent expectation value , (7.75a) The same argument applies to the uncertainty, (7.75b) We now understand precisely what is meant by stationarity: Rule In a stationary state all physically measurable properties of a (time-independent) observable are static; i.e., probabilities, expectation values, and uncertainties do not change with time. Aside: Rates of Change. You will sometimes see the time-independence of quantum- mechanical quantities expressed in terms of the rate of change of the probability density, as d dt P(x , t) = O. [in a stationary state1 (7.76) The counterpart of this form for an observable Q is d dt (Q)n = O. For example, in a stationary state, the mean value of the energy is constant, d dt (E)n = O. (7.77) (7.78) This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the classical law of conservation of energy in a conservative (macroscopic) system (Chap. II). Sec. 7.5 A Closer Look at Stationarity 261 (7.80) To Flow or Not to Flow? Before leaving this discussion, let's look at the time dependence of the probability current density [Eq. (6.112)] j(x, t) = - ;~ [\\lI*(x, t) :x \\lI(x, t) - \\lI(x, t) 88 x \\lI*(x , t)] . (7.79) In general, j(x, t) is a function of time-indeed, it is this time dependence that gives rise to the colorful (and useful) notion of a probability fluid that flows through space. But if the state represented by \\lI(x, t) is stationary, the time factors in \\lI(x, t), its complex conjugate, and their derivatives all cancel, leaving jn(x) = - ;~ [1/J;'(X) dd x 1/Jn(x) -1/Jn(x):x 1/J;'(X)] . So the probability current density in a stationary state is independent of time. Such a current density describes steady state flow-like that of the pure momentum function (Example 6.6). Question 7-11 We can arrive at this conclusion via a different path. The rate equation for the integrated position probability in a finite region [a,b] is [Eq. (6.119Â») :t r; ([a, bJ jt) = jn{a , t) - jn{b, t) . Starting from this equation, prove that the probability current density for a stationary state is independent of time. For a bound state in one dimension, a further simplification to the probability current density (7.80) ensues. Because the TISE and the boundary conditions on a bound-state wave function are real, the spatial function that solves this equation,1/Jn(x), is real. So jn(x) = O. This means that there is no probability flow in a one-dimensional bound state. Aside: Probability Flow in Three Dimensions. To glimpse the nature of probability flow for a three-dimensional system, consider the equation for pointwise conservation of probability [see Eq. (6.125) and Table 6.1] for a stationary-state wave function. The probability density for such a state doesn't depend on time, a at P{r,t) = 0, so the probability current density obeys V' . j{r, t) = O. This result shows that the probability flow in a stationary state of a three-dimensional system is solenoidal. The probability current density is zero only if the spatial function 1/J{r) is real-which is not necessarily the case for a bound state in three dimensions. A final cautionary note: Some novice quantum mechanics slip into the trap of thinking that the name \"stationary state\" implies that the particles in such a state are at rest. We know (Â§ 7.4) that for a bound state , this is false: the minimum kinetic energy of a (confined) particle is always positive. It is, of course, not the particle, but rather its physical properties that are stationary, in the sense discussed in this section. 262 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters The essential point of this section is that (for observables that don't explicitly depend on time) we can just forget about the time dependence of a stationary-state wave function and calculate probabilities and statistical quantities directly from the spatial function 1/Jn(x). But for a state that is not stationary, the probability density and (Q) (t) and (AQ)(t) may well depend on time. In the next section of this chapter, we'll put stationarity in its place by looking briefly at such a state. *7.6 SUPERPOSTIONS OF STATIONARY STATES I want to be sure you don't overlook the very special, limited nature of stationary states.l\" First, not all systems have stationary states-separable solutions to the roSE exist only for conservative systems. Second, all systems-conservative or not-s-exist in states that aren't stationary. In general, some states of an arbitrary system are bound and some are not. But in either case, the non-stationary wave functions of such a system are not simple products like 1/J(x)((t); rather, like the Gaussian (7.3), they are complicated beasties in which position and time variables are inextricably intertwined. Personally, I'm more comfortable with non-stationary states, for their physical properties are more akin to what I expect of a particle in motion. For example, the expectation value and uncertainty of position for a microscopic particle in a non-stationary state change with time, as does the position of a macroscopic particle in motion. So I want to close this chapter on stationary states with a preview of their non- stationary siblings. For future reference, I've collected the properties of these two kinds of states in Table 7.1. In this section, we'll look briefly at how non-stationary states are constructed and at the properties of a single observable-the energy-in such a state. TABLE 7.1 STATIONARY VS. NON-STATIONARY STATES. Stationary Non-Stationary State Function Ilt(x, t) = 'l/JE(x)e- i Et/ h Ilt(x, t) not separable Energy sharp: li.E = 0 not sharp: AE(t) > 0 Average Energy (E) = E, independent of t (E) independent of t Position Probability Density P(x) = l'l/Je(x)1 2 P(x, t) = IIlt(x,t)1 2 Observable Q (Q) independent of t (Q) (t) may depend on t The Energy in a Non-Stationary State One way to construct a wave function for a non-stationary state is to superpose some stationary-state wave functions, controlling the mixture of each contributing stationary state in our non-stationary brew by assigning each a coefficient. We did just this in Chap. 4, where we constructed a continuum wave function (a wave packet) for a free 14This section is an advance look at material we'll cover in depth in Chap. 12, so you can skip it if you want to. Sec. 7.6 Superpositions of Stationary States 263 (7.81) (7.82) particle by superposing pure momentum functions, using the amplitude function to control the mixture in the packet. Because the pure momentum functions are functions of infinite extent, we had to superpose an infinite number of them to produce a spatially localized wave packet. Similarly, we can use superposition to construct non-stationary wave functions for bound states. But unlike their continuum counterparts, bound-state wave packets are spatially localized even if they include only a finite number of contributors, because each of these contributors is itself spatially localized. I wrote down one such function for the infinite square well in Example 6.4 [Eq. (6.63)]: \\l1(x, t) = J1:~[2 t/71(x )e-iE,t/n + 7 t/72(X)e-iE2t/li-]. Notice that two values of the energy appear in this function, E 1 and E 2 â€¢ This duplicity of energies suggests that the energy of the state represented by the superposition function \\l1(x, t) is not sharp . Indeed, it isn't. The energy uncertainty for this non-stationary state is positive, as we'll now demonstrate. Example 7.4. The Strange Case of the Uncertain Energy The energy uncertainty (~E)(t) = J(E2) - (E)2 depends on two expectation values, (E) (t) and (E 2 ) . The first of these is the mean value of the energy; for the state represented by (7.81), this value is +L/2 (E) (t) = 5 13 J [2'1/Ji(x)e+iE,t/\" + 7'1!J2(x)e+iE2t/,,] -L/2 x it [2'1/Ji(x)e- iE,t/\" + 7'1!J2(x)e- iE2t/,,] dx. The (real) spatial functions in (7.82) are given by Eqs. (7.55), and their energies by (7.56). The worst path to take at this point is to substitute these functions, their energies, and the explicit form of the Hamiltonian into this equation; this path leads immediately into a thorny patch of messy algebra. We can avoid the briar patch by leaving the spatial functions and energies unspecified as long as possible. For example, from the T1SE we know what the Hamiltonian does to the spatial functions in the integrand: it [2tPl(x)e-iElt/\" + 7tP2(x)e-iE2t/r,] = 2E 1tPl(x)e- iE,t/\" + 7E2tP2(x)e-iE2t/\". So we can write (7.82) as four similar integrals, (7.83) +L/2 +L/2 (E) (t) = 5 13 {4El JtPl(x)tPdx)dx + 14E 1 JtP2(X)tPl(x)dxei(E2- E tl t/\" -L/2 -L/2 (7.84) +L/2 +L/2 +14E2 J tPl(X)tP2(x)dxe- i(E2- E tl t/\" + 49E2 J tP2(X)tP2(X)dx}. -L/2 -L/2 These four integrals fall into two classes. Two are normalization integrals of the form (7.27). These are easy to evaluate: 264 Chap. 7 Simplify ing Matters (7.85) +L/2 J W1(x)'1/JI(x)dx = 1 -L/2 +L/2 JW2(X)W2(X)dx = 1. -L/2 The other two are integrals of two different spatial functions. Since the spatial functions (7.55) are real, these integrals are equal: +L/2 +L/2 +L/2 J W2(X)W1(X)dx= J W1(X)W2(X)dX=y J cOS(1Ty)sin(21Ty)dx, (7.86) -L/2 -L/2 -L/2 I hope you recognize this as the orthogonality integral for the sine and cosine functions- and remember that this integral equals zero. If not, please go refresh your memory with a glance at Eq. (4.45).15 Inserting Eqs. (7.85) and (7.86) into the expectation value (7.84), we get (with refreshingly little work) the ensemble average of the energy in the non-stationary state (7.81), (7.87) (7.88) Notice that this is not equal to any of the eigenvalues En of the Hamiltonian. This exemplifies a general result for all non-stationary states: the average value of the energy of a particle in a non-stationary state is not one of the energy eigenvalues. Nevertheless, in an energy measurement each member of the ensemble exhibits one and only one of these eigenvalues (Chap. 13). That is, only the eigenvalues En are observed in an energy measurement, whatever the state of the system . The mean of these values is not equal to one of the eigenvalues because, as we're about to discover, individual measurement results fluctuate around (E). Notice also that the time dependence has vanished from the expectation value of the energy of a non-stationary state, (7.87), as it did (Â§ 7.5) from this quantity for a stationary state. This time-independence is a consequence of the structure of Eq. (7.84): each time- dependent factor in this equation is multiplied by an orthogonality integral that is equal to zero. No such simplification occurs for an arbitrary observable Q, because the integrals that multiply time-dependent factors in (Q) (t) contain factors other than the spatial functions. Thus, for this state, (x) (t) and (P) (t) do depend on time. Now back to the energy uncertainty. The other expectation value we need is +L/2 (E2) = 5 13 J [2W1(x)e+iEIt/h + 7W2(x)e+iE2t/li] -L/2 x ie [2W1(x)e-iElt/r, + 7W2(x)e-iE2t/r,] dx. The evaluation of (E 2 ) proceeds just like that of (E) . We work out the effect of ie on the wave function (7.81) using it 2 = itit, as in Eq. (7.72). There result four integrals very much like those of (7.84). As before, two are normalization integrals and two 15 Such orthogonality integrals are omn ipresent in quantum mechanics (Part IV). The general form of such an integral is J::'oc- \"p;'(X)\"pm (x)dx . It is a general property of the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian that for two different spatial functions ti.e., for n =1= m), this integral is zero. Sec. 7.6 Superpositions of Stationary States 265 are orthogonality integrals. And the latter are zero. Working through a simple arithmetic calculation, we find (E 2) = 1 (E2 9E2) 53 4 1 + 4 2 1 [ 2 2]= 53 4E1 + 49(4E1 ) = 788 Er 53 Using this result and (7.87) for (E), we obtain the uncertainty for the state (7.81), (7.89) !:i.E = 788 E2 _ (200)2 E2 = 0.79E 53 1 53 1 I Â· (7.90) Question 7-12 Fill in the steps completely and carefully to obtain Eq. (7.90). Understanding this simple analysis will make solving later problems involving non-stationary states much easier. So the energy for this non-stationary state is not sharp. Individual results of an ensemble energy measurement fluctuate about (E) = 3.77 E 1 with a standard deviation of !:i.E = 0.79 E 1 â€¢ This behavior differs strikingly from that of a stationary state like the one in Example 7.3. For the latter, all members give the same value, (E) n = En with no fluctuations, and (!:i.E)n = O. General Non-Stationary States I included in the non-stationary wave function (7.81) only two const ituents, the wave functions for the ground and first-excited states. The obvious generalization of this example is an infinite superposition, the most general non-stationary state: 00 '11(x, t) = 2: cn'l/Jn{X)e-iEnt/1i n=l general non-stationary state (7.91) For the infinite square well, this wave function looks like '11(x,t) = f: CnIi cos (mrlJ e- iEnt/1i n=1 \"dd (7.92) The coefficients Cn, which may be complex, control the mixture of stationary states. For the state (7.81) of the infinite square well, these guys are 2 ci = ./53' 7 C2 = ./53' C3 = C4 = ... = O. 266 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters These numbers are called, quite reasonably, mixture coefficients or expansion coeffi- cients. Let's look for a moment at the form of the wave function (7.92) at the initial time, t = 0: W(x,O) = fenIfcos ( n7fI)+f enIfsin ( n7fI). n=l n=2 odd (7.93) (7.94) Structurally, Eq. (7.93) is very like the Fourier series expansion (4.41) for the initial wave function W(x ,O). We calculate the Fourier coefficients in a series expansion of a function f(x) (Â§ 4.3) as integrals of sine or cosine functions times the function. Similarly, in quantum mechanics, we calculate the expansion coefficients in a non-stationary state wave function of the form (7.91) as integrals over the initial state function, to wit: cn(O) = i:tP~(x)W(x,O)dx. Because these coefficients are intimately related to the wave function at the initial time , I've appended to them the argument (0). The parallel between (7.94) and the techniques of Fourier analysis is striking and no accident (Chap. 12). Deducing the State Function Equation (7.94) shows that from the initial wave function we can determine the expansion coefficients {cn(O)} and thence the state function W(x, t). But in the real world of laboratory physics, we often cannot proceed in this fashion. Instead we determine these coefficients experimentally-e.g., by measuring the energy of the system in its initial state. To show you how this goes, I want to consider a final example.16 Example 7.5. Creation of a State Function You are in a laboratory. The reigning experimentalists are showing you the results of an energy measurement on an ensemble of infinite-square-well systems. These measurements unveil the state at t = 0 to be a mixture of the two stationary states with quantum numbers n = 2 and n = 6. Further, the data reveals that the relative mixture of these states is 1 : 5 for n = 2 : n = 6. Your mission: determine the wave function for subsequent times, \\11(x, t). You know the spatial functions tPn(X) and energies En in the general expansion (7.92). All you need is the coefficients cn(O). Translating the experimentalists' information into quantum mechanics, we first write down the form of the initial wave function, (7.95) and the ratio of the expansion coefficients, C2(O) C6(O) 1 SÂ· (7.96) Since C6(O) = 5C2(O), we can write the initial function (7.95) as \\I1(x,O) = C2(O)l/12(X) + 5C2(O)tP6(X) = C2(O) ItP2(x) + 5tP6(XÂ») . (7.97) 16From such a measurement we can determine only the ratio of the magnitudes of these coefficients- not their real and imaginary parts. But we can discover their relative phases via other experiments, thereby fully determining the initial state function (to within the usual global phase factor). For more on such matters, see Chap. 13. Sec. 7.6 Superpositions of Stationary States 267 All that remains is to evaluate C2(0) in (7.97) and to write the resulting function in the general form (7.92) for t > O. But what quantum-mechanical relationship can we use to calculate this coefficient? Well, there's only one property of the wave function \\II(x , 0) that we haven't already used. Can you think what it is? Right: we haven 't normalized the initial function . The coefficient C2(0) provides the flexibility we need to enforce the condition +L/2i:\\II\"(x, 0)\\11(x ,O)dx = J \\II\"(x, 0) \\II(x, O)dx = 1. (7.98) -L/2 A little algebra later, we find that this condition is satisfied by C2(0) = 1/V26. So the initial wave function is In trying to generalize an initial wave function such as (7.99) to times t > 0, many newcomers to quantum mechanics come to grief. One of their most common mistakes is to write the t > 0 wave function as ~ [1/J2(X) + 5tP6(X)] e- iEt/ li . I hope it's clear why this y26 form is grossly in error. If not, please ponder and commit to memory the following: WARNING You cannot extend the initial state function for a non-stationary state to times t > 0 by multiplying by a single factor e- iEt/ li â€¢ There is no single value of E that characterizes the state, because the energy of the state is not sharp. The right way to proceed is indicated by the general form (7.91): we multiply each term in the expansion by the corresponding time factor . For the state represented by (7.99) at t = 0, we get (7.100) where the energies are En = n 27r2h.2/(2mL 2 ) for n = 2 and n = 6. I want to leave you thinking about the similarity between the procedure we used in Example 7.5 to determine the wave function for a bound non-stationary state of a particle in a box and the one we used in Â§ 4.4 to determine the wave packet for an unbound non-stationary state of a free particle. Schematically, these procedures look like 'It(x, 0) =} A(k) =} 'It(x, t) = ~ JOO A(k)ei(kx-wt) dk y21l' -00 00 'It(x, 0) =} {c\",(0)} =} 'It(x,t) = LCn(O)1/Jll(x)e- iEnt/1i n [continuum state) [bound state) (7.101) (7.102) 268 Chap. 7 Simplifying Matters The similarity between these procedures suggests that A(k) and {cn(O)} play analogous roles in the quantum theory of continuum and bound states. Germinating in this com- parison are the seeds of a powerful generalization of these procedures, as we'll discover in Chap. 12. 7.7 FINAL THOUGHTS: DO STATIONARY STATES REALLY EXIST? In this chapter, I've introduced the \"other\" Schrodinger Equation, the TISE H:if)E = E'l/JE . The first Schrodinger Equation you met (in Chap. 6) was the TDSE, H\\It = Â£\\It. (7.103) (7.104) It's vital that you never lose sight of the difference between these equations and their roles in quantum theory. The time-dependent Schrodinger Equation (7.104) is a second-order partial differ- ential equation in space and time variables. We do not see in it a value of the energy because in general, we cannot associate a single, well-defined value of this observable with a quantum state. Instead, we find the energy operator t . We use this equation to study the evolution of any state, whether or not it is stationary. The time-independent Schrodinger Equation (7.103) is an eigenvalue equation in the position variable x (for a one-dimensional, single-particle system). The eigenvalue is E , the value of the (sharp) energy. We use this equation to solve for the spatial dependence of a stationary-state wave function \\It = 'l/JE e- i E t / h â€¢ Like many elements of physical theory, stationary states are an idealization. In the real world, one can prepare a system, via ensemble measurements, to be in a stationary state at an initial time. But the system won't remain in such a state indefinitely. Only a truly isolated system would, in principle, remain in a stationary state for all time-and in the real world a system cannot be isolated from all external influences. Even if we take great pains to remove from the vicinity of a particle all other objects and sources of fields, the particle interacts with the vacuum electromagnetic field that permeates all space. Understanding the origin of this field requires knowledge of relativistic quantum theory, which is beyond our current expertise. But the important point is that this field causes mixing of other stationary states with the initial state. This mixing may induce the system to eventually undergo a transition to another state. The key word here is \"eventually\"-in many cases, a microscopic system remains in a stationary state long enough for us to perform an experiment. For example, excited stationary states of atoms are stable for periods ranging from 10-9 to 10- 2 sec, depending on the type of transition the atom eventually undergoes. On the time scale of atomic processes, such durations are fairly long. So, provided we're interested in an event that occurs on an atomic time scale, we can safely treat the system as being in a stationary state. In spite of their slightly idealized nature, stationary states have become the heart and soul of quantum mechanical calculations. Their usefulness-and the ease of solution of the TISE compared to the TDSE-fully justifies the time we shall spend on them, beginning in the next chapter. Sec. 7.7 Final Thoughts: Do Stationary States Really Exist? 269 EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS \"Is not my logic absolute? Would not a three-year-old child of most deficient intellect be conv inced by it?\" -Jules de Grandin in Satan's Stepson by Seabury Quinn The problems in this chapter explore several aspects of stationarity and the properties of stationary-state wave functions. In addition, you 'll further your understanding of the probability current density, examine a non-stationary \"sloshing\" state, and discover how to use the simple infinite square well to approximate a very complicated organic molecule.

In exercises and problems earlier in this book, we have investigated several properties of this system. In this problem, we'll gather together and generalize some of these properties. [a] Derive a general expression for the position uncertainty (Ax)n for the nth stationary state of this system. Calculate (Ax)n for n = I , 2, 3, and 4. Discuss briefly the physical significance of the variation of the position uncertainty as n increases. [b) Repeat part (a) for the momentum uncertainty (AP)n. [c) Evaluate (T) n for the nth stationary state. 7.s An Application ofthe Infinite Square Well A surprising number of physical systems can be modelled by the infinite square well of Â§ 7.4. For instance, the hexatriene molecule is a fairly complicated organic system. Some of the electrons in this molecule (the six \"7r electrons\") are delocalized (i.e., are free to move about inside the molecule). We can model this system by treating the electrons as if they were in an infinite potential well with walls located a distance of one-half the bond length from each of the terminal carbon nuclei, as shown in the Fig. 7.5.1. Using such a model, the width of the box turns out to be L = 7.3 A. Figure 7.5.1 A ludicrously simple model of a very complicated organic molecule. [a] Evaluate the first four energy levels of an electron in the (model) hexatriene molecule. Express your answers in joules and in eV. As we'll learn in Volume II, electrons in many-electron systems are subject to some unusual constraints. For example, if a one-dimensional system contains more than two electrons, then only two electrons can have the same energy. We describe this situation rather colorfully, by saying that two electrons with the same energy \"occupy the same energy level.\" So in a multi-electron one-dimensional \"atom,\" no more than two electrons can occupy the same energy level. (This is the essence of The Pauli Exclusion Principle.) Applying this principle to the hexatriene molecule, we find that the ground state of this system is the state in which the lowest three energy levels are completely \"filled,\" each with two electrons per level. [b) Now, suppose we irradiate a hexatriene molecule in its ground state with radiation of just the right wavelength to induce a transition of one electron from the n = 3 to the n = 4 energy level. Calculate the wavelength (in angstroms) of the photon that is absorbed when this transition occurs. The experimentally observed absorption band occurs at >. = 2580 A. Compare your answer to the observed wavelength and decide whether the infinite square well is a good model of this system. Exercises and Problems 211 7.6 Probability Flux and Standing Waves In Example 7.1 we saw that the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for a free particle can be written either in terms of complex travelling waves [Eq. (7.34)] or real standing waves [such as Eqs, (7.35)]. In solving bound-state problems, the standing-wave solutions are by far the more convenient choice. The general form of the spatial function for a free particle with energy E in terms of standing waves is where t/JE(X) = Asinkx + Bcoskx, k = -I2mE Ii (7.6.1) (7.6.2) and A and B are arbitrary constants.

In Part II, while learning the rudiments of quantum physics, we examined two extremely simple systems: the free particle (Chap. 4 and Â§ 6.6-6.7) and the particle in a box (Chap. 7). Each of these systems is an idealization that we can use to model real systems. For example, we can approximate a state of particles in a low-intensity beam by a state of the free particle, and a state of conduction electrons in a metallic solid by a state of an electron in an infinite square well. The free particle was the focus of Chaps. 4 and 6. In Chap. 4, we deduced the form of the free-particle wave function: a wave packet. Then, in Chap. 6, we explored the motion of a free particle-the evolution of this wave function-and discovered that its probability density moves and spreads. Since such a particle is unconfined, its states are unbound. The particle in a box was the centerpiece of Chap. 7. In this system, the \"walls\" of the infinite square well at x = Â±L/2 constrain the particle's motion. Whether in a stationary or a non-stationary state, it cannot escape from the well, from the interval [-L/2:$ x :$ L/2]. Its states are bound. But these examples are extreme idealizations. Potentials in the real world are neither zero everywhere nor infinite anywhere. And typically, realistic potentials have both bound states (like those of the particle in a box) and unbound states (like those of the free particle). (In the parlance of quantum physics, unbound states are called continuum states or scattering states .) In this chapter and the next, we shall begin the study of the general properties of these two classes of quantum states. You will notice almost immediately that in these chapters we shift gears, emphasiz- ing problem-solving strategies and real-world applications rather than historical sidelights and theoretical formulations. (Enthusiasts of theory have only to wait for Part IV, where we return to the formalism of quantum mechanics.) Nevertheless, our focus will remain on such physical questions as what kinds of quantum states are found in nature, how can we understand their physical properties, and what do these properties tell us about the microworld? Our quest for answers to these questions will lead us through a general discussion of the nature of bound and continuum states (Â§ 8.2), a close look at continuum states (Â§ 8.3), and a step-by-step analysis of how to solve the Schrodinger Equation for a special, restricted class of potentials: those that are piecewise constant (Â§ 8.4-8.5). (We'll master the more challenging case of a continuous potential in Chap. 9.) We then launch into two famous examples: tunnelling through a potential barrier (Â§ 8.6) and bound states of a finite square well (Â§ 8.7 and 8.8). We close (Â§ 8.9) with a glimpse at a research problem in which piecewise-constant models find application. 274 Chap.S States of a Particle in One Dimension I (8.1) 8.1 WHAT DO ONE-DIMENSIONAL PIECEWISE-CONSTANT POTENTIALS HAVE TO DO WITH THE REAL WORLD? In the next few chapters we'll study in detail several one-dimensional single-particle systems . But real physical systems are, of course, three-dimensional: their state functions depend on three spatial variables (e.g., the Cartesian coordinates z, y, and z) and must satisfy the three-dimensional Schrodinger Equation . So you may be wondering: are the one-dimensional wells and barriers of these chapters merely hyped-up examples or are they relevant? To find out, let's look briefly at three-dimensional quantum mechanics . The problem posed by a three-dimensional single-particle system is by now famil- iar. If the system is conservative, its potential is independent of time. So its Hamiltonian (in Cartesian coordinates) is ~ n? ( 82 82 82) 1i=-2m 8x2+8 y2+8 z2 +V(x,y,z), and its wave functions satisfy the TDSE [ n2( 82 82 82) ] . 8 .-2m 8x2 + 8 y2 + 8z2 +V(x,y,z) '11(x,y,z,t) = tn8 t '11(x , y, z,t ). (8.2) We can simplify Eq. (8.2) via the technique of separation of variables, just as we did the one-dimensional TDSE in Â§ 7.1, because the separation of space and time does not depend on the dimensionality of the potential. The resulting separable solutions of (8.2) are products of a time factor e- i E t / h and a spatial factor. The latter is the Hamiltonian eigenfunction, the solution of the three-dimensional TISE il:r/JE(X, y, z) = [-:~(:;2 + ::2 + ::2) + V(x ,y,Z)] 1PE(X,y,z) = E1PE(X,y,Z) . (8.3) For many three-dimensional systems we can reduce (8.3) to one (or more) one- dimensional equations. Under what physical conditions might such a simplification be possible? Well, suppose the forces on the particle act in only one dimension . For example, imagine a classical system that consists of two billiard balls connected by a spring whose force constant is so large that gravity is negligible. The restoring forces on these balls acts along their line of centers, which implicitly defines a single dimension. [The quantum-mechanical counterpart of this example is the vibration of two nuclei in a diatomic molecule (Â§ 9.6).] This system illustrates the point that if the forces on a particle are uni-directional. then the potential energy that derives from these forces depends on only one spatial variable. Thus, if F = F ex, then V = V(x). This happy circumstance enables us to dramatically simplify the TISE (8.3). We effect this simplification by again invoking separation of variables . Just as in Chap. 7 we separated the t dependence of a (stationary-state) wave function '11(x, t) from its x dependence, now we can separate the x dependence of the three-dimensional Hamiltonian eigenfunction 1PE(X, y, z) from its y and z dependence. The details of this marvelous simplification will be left for Part V; but here's a glimpse ahead. separation of Variables In the Three-Dimensional TISE If the potential in Eq. (8.3) depends only on z, then there exist three-dimensional eigen- functions of if that are products of three one-dimensional functions, each of which is Sec. 8.1 Piecewise-Constant Potentials and the Real World 275 associated with a constant energy: e.g., tP<;j;(x) with Ex. These separated Hamiltonian eigenfunctions look like (8.4) (8.5) Each factor in this product eigenfunction depends on a single variable and satisfies a TISE in that variable. For instance, the x-dependent function in Eq. (8.4) satisfies the one-dimensional TlSE [ ;,,2 d 2 ()] (x) ( ) (x)) - 2m dx2 + V X tPEz X = ExtPEz (x . But what about the y- and z-dependent factors in (8.4)1 Well, by hypothesis the forces act only in the x direction, so the particle's motion in the y and z directions is that of a free particle. Therefore, the corresponding factors in the Hamiltonian eigenfunction, tP~~(y) and tP~;(z), are one-dimensional free-particle wave packets. So we can reduce the determination of the stationary states of a three-dimen- sional system with uni-directional forces to the problem of solving a one-dimensional Schrodinger Equation.1 3-D TISE HtPE(X, y, z) = EtPE(X, y, z) (8.6) free-particle functions I-D TISE + for y and z HtPE(X) = EtPE(X) The simple separation (8.4) is not the only (or the most common) way to reduce the number of variables in the Schrodinger Equation. But other methods must wait for Part V. Question 8-1 Fill in the steps leading from Eq. (8.4) to (8.5) and thereby discover the relationship between the total energy of the particle, E, and the three constants Ex, E y , and E; introduced in Eq. (8.4). On Piecewise-Constant Potentials In this chapter we'll consider conservative, one-dimensional single-particle systems whose potentials are piecewise constant. A piecewise-constant potential is one that is constant for all values of x except at a finite number of discontinuities-points where it changes from one constant value to another. You can see a simple piecewise-constant potential in Fig. 8.lc, where the finite square well (which we'll come to know and love in Â§ 8.7) is on display. 1Novice quantum mechanics are sometimes seduced by this wonderful simplification into thinking that the statefunctions for such a system depend only on a single spatial variable. Not true. Equation (8.4) shows us that even if the potential depends only on x. the wavefunctions depend on x and y and z, The simplification is that these dependences are those of a free particle. 276 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I Of course, real potentials are continuous, finite functions. But many widely-used model potentials are discontinuous at one or more points in space (see Â§ 8.9). Provided the potential we're modeling changes rapidly only in one or more very small regions of space, such a model may be an accurate approximation. F(x) x =a x=b y '-yJ x lix lix (a) V(xl v, V3 b X -V2 Y '-vi lix lix (bl Model V(x) a b x (el Figure 8.1 From impulsive forces to piecewise-constant model potential. (a) Uni-directional forces that change only in two very narrow regions, where they are impulsive. (b) The continuous potential energy corresponding to these forces. (c) A reliable model of the potential in (b), the TISE of which we'll solve in Â§ 8.7. Aside: More on the Validity of Piecewise-Constant Models . To keep piecewise- constant potentials in perspective, it's important to understand the particular physical conditions under which a real potential can be modeled accurately by a piecewise- constant function. The key to such insight is the forces that act in the system. The force in Fig. 8.1a is uni-directional and constant everywhere except in two small regions of size fJx centered at x = a and at x = b. In these regions, the force is impulsive. The resulting potential in Fig. 8.1b is constant everywhere except in these regions, where it changes abruptly. This potential is a prime candidate for modeling by a piecewise-constant approximation. But the mere fact that the changes in V(x) are abrupt does not mean that the model in Fig. 8.1c is a good approximation for all states. For example, the stationary states of the finite square well in this figure accurately approximate states of the potential in Fig. 8.1b only if the de Broglie wavelength of the particle is large compared to SÂ». This wavelength, A, is the characteristic dimension of the state. If Sec. 8.1 Piecewise-Constant Potentials and the Real World Ox is a small fraction of this dimension, then the details of how the potential changes in this region are irrelevant. To summarize this important guideline: Rule An abrupt change in a potential can be replaced by a discontinuous change provided the de Broglie wavelength of the particle is large compared to the size Ox of the region where the change occurs: AÂ» ox. Question 8-2 Drawing on your understanding of classieal wave phenomena (e.g., a water wave passing through the entrance to a harbor), explain why a piecewise- constant model is an accurate approximation if ox is much smaller than A. Question 8-3 The particle-in-a-box is a common model of a system whose (continuous) potential corresponds to impulsive forces. As I remarked in Chap. 7, a good example of such a system is a conduction electron in a (solid) metal. [The forces on such an electron near the surface of the solid are (to a good approximation) impulsive.] Is this model likely to be a better approximation for a stationary state with a very high or a very low energy E? Actually, one can use a piecewise-constant model even if the potential be- ing modeled is continuous. For example, Fig. 8.2 shows a famous potential from molecular physics called the Morse Potential.2 This potential pertains to diatomic molecules, such as H2 or N2 (i.e., molecules with two nuclei): it is an approximate representation of the potential energy (due to the molecular electrons) in which these nuclei vibrate about their equilibrium separation. One way to solve the TISE for the Morse potential is to approximate it by a succession of constant \"steps,\" as shown in the figure. Such a piecewise-constant model is called a quadrature approxima- tion to V(x) . (In practiee, we can more simply approximate the Morse potential by another continuous function, the simple-harmonie-oscillator potential of Chap. 9.) In any case, if we can use a piecewise-constant potential, we are in luck, for this model renders the solution of the TISE comparatively trivial. As we'll see in Â§ 8.4, we can simply write down the form of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction in each of the regions where V(x) is constant. Then we \"hook\" these pieces together (at the points of discontinuity) using a straightforward, well-defined procedure. Alas, life is rarely so simple. Many important and interesting potentials cannot be modeled accurately by a piecewise-constant approximation. And even if such a model is a good approximation for some states, it may be lousy for others. So we must augment our bag of problem-solving tricks with methods for subduing continuous potentials-which will come center stage in Chap. 9. 2The Morse potential was named after the man who dreamed it up, . Philip Morse. You can find an account of how Morse arrived at the potential that bears his name by reading his delightful autobiography. In at the Beginnings: A Physicist's Life (Cambridge. Mass.â€¢ M.LT Press, 1917). 278 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I V(x) Figure 8.2 The Morse potential. an accurate model of the electronic potential of a diatomic molecule. With x denoting the separation of the nuclei. the fonn of this potential is V(x) = De [1- e-a(x-xÂ·>t. where De and a are parameters and Xe is the x position of the minimum of the Morse well. 8.2 A DUPLICITY OF STATES: BOUND VERSUS UNBOUND STATES Because no forces confine a free particle, it can roam throughout space. In quantum mechanics, this behavior is mirrored in the particle's wave functions. We learned in Chap. 6 that no matter where we look for a free particle, we might find it. That is, since such a particle is unconfined, the probability of detecting it at any location x could, at some time, be non-zero. That 's why we call the states of a free particle unbound states. A quite different situation confronts a particle in an infinite square well: because it is confined by the forces represented by the potential, the particle is trapped . At any time, the probability of detecting the particle at a position outside the well is zero. The states of a confined particle are, sensibly, called bound states. In essence, the differences between bound and unbound states follow from their probability densities at very large values of [z]. To figure out whether a state is bound, we just ask: is the probability of finding the particle at a very large value of x ever non-zero? If not, then the particle is in a bound state.3 We can express these differences mathematically via the following conditions: 1\\11(x,tW Â· 0 x--+Â±oo at all times t [bound state) (8.7) 1\\I1(x, tW ----4. 0 x-Â±oo at any particular time t [unbound state) (8.8) 3In one-dimensional scattering theory. the region x -+ Â±oo is called the asymptotic region. In three- dimensional scattering theory. the asymptotic region is defined in terms of the radial coordinate (of spherical coordinates r, 6. and <,0): r -+ 00. Sec. 8.2 A Duplicity of States: Bound versus Unbound States 279 Equation (8.8) is just a mathematical statement of an old friend : the spatial localization of an unbound wave packet (i.e., the normalization condition). Note, by the way, that this condition is not limited to free particles; unbound states of a system may exist even if V(x) =I O. Be sure you appreciate the difference between the conditions (8.7) and (8.8). The clue is in the qualifiers , \"at all times\" for bound states versus \"at any particular time\" for unbound states. The wave function of an unbound state is spatially localized at any particular time; but the wave function of a bound state is localized in the same region of space (the vicinity of the potential) at all times . Question 8-4 Write Eqs. (8.7) and (8.8) as boundary conditions on the Hamiltonian eigenfunction 1/JE(X). Another important difference between a bound state and an unbound state is that the energy of a bound state is quantized, but the energy of an unbound state is not. [The boundary condition (8.7) leads to energy quantization for any bound stationary state (see, for example, the infinite square well in Chap . 7); the condition (8.8), however, has no such consequences.] Thus an energy measurement on an ensemble of particles in a bound state will yield only energies drawn from a discrete list, the eigenvalues: E 1 , E2 , E3 , â€¢â€¢â€¢ of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, an energy measurement on an ensemble in an unbound state may yield any of a \"continuum\" of values . That is why unbound states are called continuum states. What bound and continuum states have in common is, of course, the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Both types of wave functions satisfy [ n2 fP] a - 2m ax2 + V(x) \\11(x, t) = inat \\11(x, t) . Aside: Review. Before looking more closely at the properties of bound and contin- uum states, let's summarize their basic physics: 1. A particle in a bound state is confined by its potential. Although there may be a finite probability of detecting the particle far from the region of the potential, that probability dies to zero as x ----> Â±oo. As a consequence of these boundary conditions, the energies of stationary bound states are quantized. 2. A particle in a continuum state is unconfined. Although its state function is affected by the potential, the particle can escape the confines of that potential. Therefore it is possible to detect the particle in the asymptotic region. To complement this summary, I've gathered together in Table 8.1 the properties of bound and continuum states we deduced in earlier chapters. TABLE 8.1 BOUND VS.

Most microscopic systems support both bound and continuum states. In Fig. 8.3a, I've sketched a typical (continuous) potential and its continuum and bound-state energies. The collection of all energies (bound and continuum) of a system is called its spectrum. V(x) \"The continuum\" (a) Â£=0 (b) Figure 8.3 (a) A prototype of a one-dimensional finite-range potential. The dotted lines show the bound stationary-state energies. which in (b) are shown on an energy- level diagram. Above the x axis is the continuum of energies available to unbound states. The potential in Fig. 8.3a is one of an important class of finite-range potentials. This name is a bit misleading; it doesn't really mean that the range of the potential is finite-i.e., it doesn't imply that there exists a value of z, say x = a, such that V = 0 for x > a. In quantum physics, a finite-range potential is one that dies to zero as the spatial coordinate approaches infinity: V(x) --->1 0 x- Â±oo finite-range potential (8.10) The potential in Fig. 8.3 satisfies this condition, because V(x) is vanishingly small for x Â« Xl and xÂ» X2 . We've discussed the general properties of the bound and continuum states supported by such a potential, but it's worth taking a minute to review the kinds of bound states such a potential might support. Sec. 8.2 A Duplicity of States: Bound versus Unbound States 281 Aside: The Classical Connection. If the Hamiltonian of the microscopic system we're studying has a classical counterpart, then we can determine if the system sup- ports bound states, continuum states, or both. (In many cases, we can figure out the classical counterpart of the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian by simply making the masses macroscopic.) If there exist bound orbits of the classical Hamiltonian, then bound states of the corresponding quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian exist.\" Question 8-S (a) Deduce whether each of the following systems supports bound states, continuum states, or both, justifying your answer with physical arguments: an oscillator with potential V(r) = kr 2/2 ; a microscopic planet moving according to the Kepler potential V(r) = -It/r (where It is a constant) . (b) Describe the spectrum (discrete? continuous? both?) of these systems. As we know from Part II, bound states come in two flavors: stationary and non- stationary. A stationary state is characterized by a sharp (quantized) energy, so the uncertainty AE is zero (see the dotted lines in Fig. 8.3.) A stationary-state wave function is separable in space and time, and the corresponding probability density is independent of time. But a non-stationary state must be represented by a wave packet, which is not separable. The probability density of such a state changes with time. (Recall, for ex- ample, the non-stationary state of the infinite square well of Â§ 7.6.) And the energy of a non-stationary state is not sharp, so AE > 0 at any time. But, like a station- ary bound state, a non-stationary bound state is forever localized in the vicinity of the potential. To illustrate the nature of the states of some more-or-Iess realistic one-dimensional finite range potentials, consider Fig. 804. The potential in Fig. 8Aa arises from the Coulomb forces between two oppositely-charged particles, such as the electron and proton in a hydrogen atom. In Volume II, we'll find that this potential supports an infinite number of bound states, as well as a continuum of unbound states. An electron in a continuum state of this potential is one that has been ionized-i.e., it is localized an \"infinite distance\" from the proton, having left behind a bare, positively-charged proton.) By contrast, the purely repulsive potential in Fig. 8Ab, which resembles the interaction potential of atoms in a molecule whose electrons are in an excited state, supports no bound states. Indeed, there are no stationary states of this system. Finally, the potential in Fig. 8Ac represents an alpha particle (He++) in the nucleus of a helium atom. This potential supports a finite number of stationary bound states and an infinite number of continuum states. Most practicing physicists study both bound and continuum states. But some spe- cialists emphasize one or the other type: spectroscopists study principally bound states, and scattering theorists (e.g., your author) concentrate on continuum states. The kinds of questions these scientists ask and the way they seek answers are fundamentally differ- ent. These differences mirror the contrasts between the physics of bound and unbound states. For example, a typical calculation by a molecular scattering theorist might entail determining the probability that an atom colliding with a molecule will be scattered in a particular direction. A typical problem for a molecular structure theorist, on the other 4you remember orbits of classical particles from freshman physics, don't you? If not, you might want to review, say, Chap. 8 of Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems, 2nd ed, by Jerry B.

The experimentalists across the hall might be determining scattering data by colliding a beam of atoms into a beam of molecules or by measuring structural information, such as bound-state energies, using the techniques of spectroscopy: e.g., measuring the energy of photons emitted when a hydrogen molecule undergoes a transition between stationary states. In this chapter we shall embrace both worlds, examining bound and continuum states (for rather simple systems). For future reference, then, let's state our goals: Goals 1. For the Study of Bound States: Solve the TISE for the stationary-state energies and wave functions-the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian-by imposing the boundary conditions appropriate to a bound state. 2. For the Study of Continuum States: Use the Schrodinger Equation to calculate the probability that a particle of known (but uncertain) energy will (at large times t) be found at a large positive value of x or at a large negative value of x. Sec. 8.2 A Duplicity of States: Bound versus Unbound States 283 *8.3 PARTICLES IN COLLISION: AN INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM SCATTERING There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand. -Count Dracula in Dracula by Bram Stoker When a microscopic particle is scattered by a microscopic target, the particle's linear momentum (and other properties, such as energy) may be changed. In quantum (as in classical) physics, the complicated interaction of a projectile and a target is represented by a continuous potential energy. In this section, we'll model this interaction (for a collision in one dimension) by a piecewise-constant potential V(X).5 By contrast to a quantum collision, let's ponder a classical collision. In particular, let's model the projectile-target interaction by the barrier in Fig. 8.5a. Suppose a macro- scopic particle travels toward the target in the direction of positive x with a well-defined energy E . The outcome of the ensuing encounter depends on whether this energy is less than or greater than the barrier height Vo. If E < Vo (e.g., E 1 in Fig. 8.5a), the particle has insufficient kinetic energy to \"scale\" the barrier and is repelled-we say it is reflected . So after such a collision, the particle is travelling backward (in the -x direction) with the same energy, E. In this elastic collision, only the direction of the projectile's linear momentum is changed. If, on the other hand, E > Vo (e.g., E 2 in Fig. 8.5a), the particle passes through the region where V #- o-we say it is transmit- ted. Its speed is reduced only while it is in the interval [-L/2 ::s x ::s L/21, so after the collision, the particle is travelling forward (in the +x direction) with energy E. Thus, in a classical collision there are two mutually-exclusive outcomes: either the projectile is reflected (if E < Vo) or it is transmitted (if E > Vo). But in a quantum collision, possibilities abound.\" In fact (Â§ 8.6), regardless of the proximity of E to Vo, both reflection and transmission are possible. Even if the mean energy of the projectile is significantly less than the barrier height, the particle may \"penetrate (tunnel through) the barrier,\" appearing after the collision at a large positive value of x. And even if its mean energy is much greater than Vo, the particle may be reflected, appearing at a large negative value of x. Of these two phenomena, perhaps the most remarkable is tunnelling; we'll explore this quintessential quantal marvel in Â§ 8.6. 5This section conta ins a qualitative justification for using continuum stationary states (e.g., pure mo- mentum functions) in the study of collisions. This justification is preceded by a time-dependent description of a quantum mechanical collision that you may want to skip. But if you do so. please review Â§ 6.9 (especially Example 6.6) before proceeding to the next section. 6The energy of a microscopic projectile in an unbound state cannot be sharp . In Fig. 8.5b I've acknowledged this fact by a fuzzy blur around the energies El < Vo and E2 > Vo. So El and E2 represent the mean energies (the expectation values) of the projectile in quantum states Il'l (x , t) and 1l'2(X, t) . for both of which t.E > O. 284 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I Transmitted x â€¢ x Figure 8.5 (a).

The same for a microscopic particle of uncertain energy incident from the left on a microscopic target. Note that El = (E) = ('I'l(X ,t) I HI 'l'l(X,tÂ») and similarly for E2. A Microscopic Collision in a Macroscopic Laboratory In Fig. 8.6a you'll find a (very) simple schematic of an experiment to study quantum collisions. This apparatus consists of a source, a target, and a detector. To be specific, suppose we want to study the scattering of electrons from a species of atom. As a source we would use an electron gun, like the one in the double-slit experiment (Chap. 2). This device produces a beam of nearly monoenergetic electrons of sufficiently low density that (to a good approximation) the particles in the beam do not interact with one another. The target in our experiment might be a bottle containing a gas of atoms, all of which (we'll assume) are in the same quantum state.\" Finally, the detector, which is located far from the source and the target, is any device that can measure the number of electrons scattered at a particular angle and their energies. (One such device is an electron multiplier.) In the experiment , we measure (a) properties of the projectiles in the beam that is emitted by the source; and (b) properties of the scattered particles that arrive at the detector. By so doing, we can investigate the structure and physical properties of the target and the nature of the interaction of microscopic particles . From such experiments has come much of our knowledge of the nature of matter-not to mention reassuring evidence that quantum mechanics is valid. The Wave-Packet Description of a Microscopic Collision To predict, confirm, or understand the results of a quantum collision experiment, we must calculate the probability that after the collision we would detect a (scattered) particle in the asymptotic region, where the detector is. Initially, all we know about the particle is its state function before the collision, \\l1(r, t) . 7In practice, conditions like the temperature of the apparatus determine the distribution of states of the atoms in the gas. Another complication is the possibility of multiple collisions; e.g., a projectile bounces off an atom only to collide with one or more additional atoms before it leaves the target region.

Such experiments are described using the spherical coordinates shown in (b) Let's denote the duration of the collision by the time interval 6.t and suppose that this interval is centered around the collision time teoll. So the particle leaves the source at to Â« teoll and is detected at td Â» teoll.8 Now, collisions are intrinsically time-dependent phenomena. So the most di- rect way to calculate the probabilities we need would be to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the wave packet that represents the state of the projectiles. We would initialize this equation with the function that describes the (known) state of the projectile at the initial time to, when the particle is localized in the vicinity of the source. We would then solve the TDSE for the state function at some time t Â» teoll and from the solution, evaluate the probability density for various locations of the detector. 8Ideally, we'd define the beginning of the interval L:l.t as \"the time when the collis ion begins\"-i.e.,the time at which the particle is sufficiently near the region of non-zero potential that its wave function begins to deviate from that of a free particle. And we'd define the end of the interval as the time at which the particle is sufficiently far from the potential that its wave function is altered no further. Unfortunately, this unambiguous definition becomes muddled if, as is often the case, the range of the potential V(r) is not finite. A common instance of this irritating behavior is a potential that, as T --+ 00, dies to zero as a power of T . The preeminent example is the Coulomb potential, which dies to zero as liT. We shall leave such troublesome ambiguities to more advanced treatments of quantum collisions. (See, for example , the excellent presentation in Chap. 2 of Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Scattering by L. S. Rodberg and R. M. Thaler (New York: Academic Press, 1967). For a very nice introduction at a lower level, see the qualitative discussion in Â§ 9-11 of An Introduction to Quantum Physics by A. P. French and E. F. Taylor (New York: W. W. Norton, 1978). Come to think of it, all of Chap. 9 of this fine text would serve as useful supplementary reading for this chapter. You should also peruse the following papers, which supplement the discussions in this section: H. Eberly, Amer. Jour. Phys. 33,771 (1965) ; A. N. Kamal, ibid., 46 (1984) ; and I. Galbraith, Y. S. Ching , and E. Abraham, ibid., 60 (1984).) 286 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I This plan of attack sounds fine. But it leads to severe mathematical complications. In fact, these difficulties are so severe that we can't solve the TDSE except for very simple problems. Even for such a problem, the algebraic details of the solution would take us far astray. So here I want to show you the qualitative solution of one such problem: scattering by the potential barrier in Fig. 8.5b. Suppose that before the collision, the particles in the incident beam are in a state that can be represented by a Gaussian wave packet (see Chaps. 4 and 6). For convenience, let's denote the initial time (which is some t Â« tcoll) by to = O. To conform to the experimental situation, the center of the initial wave packet, the expectation value (x}(O), is at a large negative value of x near the source (see Fig. 8.7a). To ensure that the particle is travelling to the right (toward the target), the mean momentum of the initial packet must be positive. (In fact, let's choose (P) (0) > v'2mVo.) Finally, to ensure that the beam is nearly monochromatic, the initial packet must have a very small non-zero momentum uncertainty (~p)(O) ~ O. (The mathematical form of a wave packet with these properties appears in Pblm. 4.6.) These and other properties of the incident wave packet are summarized in the box in Fig. 8.7a.

What happens during the collision [(b)I is a mystery. but a clue appears in Fig. 8.8. Now consider times t > O. Until the incident particles near the target, the proba- bility density of their state is localized in regions where V(x) ~ O. So from to to the \"beginning of the collision\" (a time t '\" tcoll), the projectiles propagate to the right as Sec. 8.3 Particles in Collision: An Introduction to Quantum Scattering 287 free particles-s-i.e., according to Â§ 6.7. The center of the probability density, for example, moves to the right at the group velocity, whose value we know to be vgr = (P) (O)/m.9 EventualIy, the particles move into range of the potential, and their state functions begin to distort. The evolution of the wave packet during the collision ti.e., during the interval ~t) is described by the TOSE (8.9) with the barrier potential of Fig. 8.7. What happens then is nothing short of remarkable. Figure 8.8 shows the results of a computer's solution of this equation for two barrier potentials of different widths. As a consequence of the incident particles' encounter with the barrier, the incident packet seems to \"break up,\" forming two packets, one reflected, the other transmitted. But we in the laboratory cannot observe what happens during the collision, for the interaction takes place on a length scale of atomic dimensions, typically on the order of 10- 10 m, So we wait. Once the collision is \"over\" (i.e., at some t Â» teoll), we look to the detector to discover what happened.!? After a large number of collisions have occurred, we tote up the fraction of particles that were reflected and the fraction that were transmitted. From these fractions, we then calculate the measured probability for reflection or transmission of a particle in the incident beam. . These \"measured probabilities\" agree with quantum-mechanical predictions based on the reflected and transmitted wave packets obtained from solution of the TOSE at large t Â»t eoll' So both theory and experiment predict that the probability density after the collision consists of two pieces: one due to the reflected wave packet, which I'll denote by Wrefl(X, t), the other due to the transmitted packet, Wtrans(x, t). The mean momentum of the reflected packet is negative (i.e., it corresponds to particle motion in the -x direction), and that of the transmitted packet is positive (motion in the +x direction). But neither of these packets individually represents the state of the scattered particles-the wave function is the (unnormalized) superposition W(x, t) = 'I1refl (X, t) + Wtrans(x, t). tÂ» teoll (8.11) After the collision, the reflected and transmitted packets propagate according to the free- particle Schrodinger equation, because, like the incident packet, they are localized in regions of zero potential.11 Your understanding of this collision as a quantum-mechanical phenomenon hinges on your grasp of the Born interpretation of the wave packets in (8.11). Each packet is a probability amplitude. The reflected packet, for instance, is the amplitude for the possibility that in a position measurement after the collision, we would detect a particle at some x Â« -L/2 moving in the -x direction (towards the source}--a possibility we've described as reflection. The probability of this possibility actually occurring in an experiment can be calculated as l'I1refl (X, tW [although there is a much easier way to determine this information (cf. Â§ 8.4)]. Note, by the way, that each particle in the 9The probability density also spreads a bit, but since wave packet spreading is not germane to our concerns here. I'll neglect it. 10 Actually. we need two detectors. In our one-dimensional paradigm. both reflection and transmission are possible. so we put one detector at large negative x and one at large positive x . In a three-dimensional collision, reflection and transmission are but two of an infinity of possible outcomes, corresponding to all angles 6 and <p in Fig. 8.6b. Reflection corresponds to 6 = 7r and transmission to 6 = o. 11 This analysis holds until a scattered particle is detected. An encounter with a detector constitutes a measurement and actualizes one of the possibilities implicit in the wave function. Such a measurement therefore alters the state function (at the instant of detection), changing it into a function that is localized at the detector. For more on the fascinating subject of measurement in quantum theory see Chap. 13. 288 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I---------~_...---------~-_----II--_...-\"\"t___x-----\"\"'t(a)(b]PIx,t)~t---___x(c)!Figure8.8(a)SnapshotsofthepositionprobabilitydensityforawavepacketincidentfromtheleftonapotentialbarrierofheightVoandwidthL.(b)Sameas(a)forabarrierofwidthL/2.(c)Sameas(b)forabarrierofheight2Vo.Inallthreefigures,thesoliddotindicatesthepredictionofclassicalphysicsforthissystem.[FromThePictureBookofQuantumMechanicsbyS.BrandtandH.D.Dahmen(NewYork:JohnWiley,1985).Usedwithpennission.) incident beam is either reflected or transmitted. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, particles do not divide. Question 8-6 By my choice of the mean momentum of the initial packet, I arranged the above example so that the mean momentum of the particles after the collision is negative, i.e., (P}(t) = (111(x, t) I jJ I 111(x, tÂ» < 0 (t Â» tcoll)' (8.12) What does this fact imply about the relative magnitude of the integrated probabilities for the reflected and transmitted packets? Solving Collision Problems with Continuum Stationary States Few practicing quantum physicists carry out the procedure I've just sketched . The numerical solution of the TDSE for a real collision remains impossible even on present- day supercomputers-which sad fact would seem to make the study of real scattering processes impossible. Happily, there is a way out of this conundrum. This gambit requires relaxing very slightly the normalizability requirement on state functions. To facilitate calculation of scattering probabilities, physicists have admitted into quantum mechanics a class of functions called continuum stationary-state functions. These functions are finite everywhere, but they are not normalizable . Hence a continuum stationary-state function is not, strictly speaking, physically admissible. Nevertheless, we can use such functions to solve scattering problems, provided we are very careful about their use and interpretationP You've already seen a continuum stationary-state function: the pure momentum function wp(x,t) = Aei(kx-wt), (8.13a) which I used in Â§ 6.9 to represent the state of particles in a beam. For instance, in Example 6.7 we learned how to choose the constants in this form to represent a beam of 0.0leV particles with a current of 3.0 nanoamp-cm\", viz., A = 3.161 x 1O-4m- 3/ 2 , k = 1.621 x 109m- I , (8.13b) w = 1.520 X 1014 sec-I. And we found that the probability current density for this beam is j = 1.873 X 1014 sec-I. I mention the probability current density because, beginning in the next section, this quantity will playa crucial role in our study of quantum collisions . There we'll discover how to calculate reflection and transmission probabilities from current densities for the various wave packets shown in Fig. 8.5. But before turning to problem solving, let's look further at the use in quantum collision theory of functions that are not physically admissible. Consider again the incident packet in the collision experiment of Fig. 8.7. I defined the initial parameters of this packet (which are shown in the figure) so as to minimize 120ne can come to grief, for example, calculating expectation values of some observables with a continuum stationary-state function, for such expectation values may be infinite. And the integrated probability density (over all space) for a continuum stationary state is infinite; so this quantity cannot be interpreted as in Â§ 3.4. 290 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I the energy uncertainty at to = 0, (~E)(O). For a free particle, this quantity is related to the position uncertainty by P h P 1 (~E)(O) = m ~p(O) 2:: 2\" ;;; ~x(O)' (8.14) Nature won't let us produce a beam with (~E)(O) = 0, so we must settle for (~E)(O) Â« 1. But according to Eq. (8.14), this condition implies that the packet is very fat: (~x)(O) Â» 1, i.e., we know little about the incident particle's position . [We don't need to know the initial position to analyze our experiment, provided the particle is initially far from the target, which we guarantee by choosing (x) (0) to be of macroscopic size, say (x) (0) = 10m.] So the incident wave packet is a superposition of pure momentum states (8.13a), with momenta chosen so the momentum probability amplitude is narrowly peaked about Po. An excellent approximation to this packet is the limit of an infinitely large packet: a pure momentum state with momentum Po = (P) (0) and energy Eo = pU2m. To summarize this argument: wave-packet description (~E)(O)-O I (~x)(O)-oo continuum stationary state description Thus, a continuum stationary-state function is an idealized model of a huge wave packet , with a very small spread of energies about Eo. In the (~E)(O) ~ 0 limit, we can approximate the state of the particles in the beam by this monoenergetic continuum stationary-state function . Question 8-7 Thought question: The energy uncertainty is related to the duration of the collision by the energy-time uncertainty relation (Â§ 11.8), (6E)(6t) 2:: n/2. Based on this relation, discuss the consequences for our experiment of the requirement that (6E)(O) ~ O. Question 8--8 With a little imagination, one can dream up a classical analogue of the time-independent picture of a microscopic collision. Consider the Rock of Gibraltar in a hurricane. Water waves (of considerable amplitude) scatter from the Rock. To detect them, we put the Queen Mary nearby and measure her vertical displacement. Consider first a short incident group of waves that encounter the Rock at tcun. Sketch the wave pattern in the ocean for t Â» tcun. Now suppose a huge wave group is (continuously) incident on the Rock; sketch the steady- state condition that obtains at t Â» teon. How is this classical example analogous to the quantum collisions of this section? 8.4 SOLVING THE TISE FOR A PIECEWISE-CONSTANT POTENTIAL Although the details of how to solve bound- and continuum-state problems differ, certain characteristics are shared by both kinds of states. What makes solving the TISE for a piecewise-constant potential so easy is the simple analytic form of the \"pieces\" of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction in each region of space where the potential is constant. The particular functional form of these pieces depends on whether the energy of the state is Sec. 8.4 Solving the TISE for a Piecewise-Constant Potential 291 less than or greater than the value of the potential in the region, but in either case, the pieces of 'l/JE(X) are easy to write down. Indeed, the only non-trivial part of solving the problem is hooking the pieces together. The piecewise-constant nature of the potentials we'll consider in the rest of this chapter allow us to develop a simple five-step procedure for solving the TISE for such a system. Before we explore this procedure, here's an overview, to which you can refer as you work through this section: Procedure for Piecewise-Constant Potentials. Step 1. Divide space (- 00 < x < 00) into regions according to the values of V(x). In each region, V(x) = constant. Then classify each region as classically allowed or classically forbidden according to the energy of the state. Step 2. Write down the general solution to the TISE in each region. Step 3. Impose physical conditions (as appropriate) on the pieces of 'l/JE(X) in the first and last regions. These conditions will depend on whether the state is bound or unbound: for bound states, they ensure that the eigenfunction goes to zero as x --+ Â±oo; for unbound states, they correspond to circumstances in the laboratory. Step 4. Hook the pieces of the eigenfunction together, using continuity conditions. Step 5. Finish the problem (methodology differs for bound and unbound states): Bound States: Impose boundary conditions (usually in the limits x --+ Â±oo) to obtain quantized energies . Then normalize the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. Unbound States: Evaluate the probability current densities in the first and last regions and from them the probabilities for transmission and reflection. Regions and How to Classify Them To define the regions of a piecewise-constant potential we need only look at it. But to classify these regions, we must consider the energy of the state we are interested in. Thus the definition of a region is independent of the state; its classification is not. A region is simply a finite (or semi-infinite) range of x in which the potential is constant. Thus, in the qth region V(x) I. = Vq regron q (8.15) (8.16) (We allow for semi-infinite ranges, because the first region includes the limit x --+ -00 and the last includes x --+ +00.) This definition is illustrated in Fig. 8.9.13 The equation we must solve in region q is the TISE ( -~~ +v,) 'l/J(q)(x) = E'l/J(q) (x) 2mdx 2 q E E Clearly, the TISE in a particular region may differ from that in any other region. So, like Frankenstein's monster, the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for energy E is assembled out of 13For consistency and convenience. I have chosen the zero of energy in this section so that all energies and potentials are positive: E > 0 and V; > O. But for some problems (e.g.â€¢ the finite square well of Â§ 8.9) it's more convenient to choose the zero of energy at the top of a potential well. The latter choice is analogous to the convention used in atomic physics. 292 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I V(x) V21 I I I V4I I I i I I I :I I I I I V(x) I I I I I I---q = 1--0+1...q = 2+t-q = 3+q = 4-1 I I I I I (a) x E (b) x Figure 8.9 How to define and classify region s for (a) a piecewise-constant potential with 4 regions, and (b) a continuous potent ial.

The relationship of the piece tP~)(x) to the full eigenfunction tPE(X) is simple but crucial: (8.17) For example, the system in Fig. 8.9a has four regions, so we construct its Hamil- tonian eigenfunction as -00 < x :5 Xl Xl :5 X :5 X2 X2 :5 X :5 X3 X3 :5 X < 00. (8.18) For a more general potential with N regions, we assemble tPE(X) asl 4 14Some students find \"segmenting\" the eigenfunction in this way confu sing, probably because they try to ascribe overmuch physical significance to the pieces 1/J<;J (x). If you prefer, just think of this segmentation as a problem-solving strategy . The point to remember is: when all is said and done. physical informat ion about the state is contained in the Hamiltonian eigenfunction 1/JE(X). This procedure is similar to one in the study of transmission and reflection of electromagnetic waves through media with different indexes of refraction. (See, for example, Chap. 8 of Introduction to Electrodynamics by D. J. Griffiths (Englewood Cliffs, N. 1.: Prentice Hall, 1981) or Â§ 4.3 of Optics, 4th ed. by E. Hecht and A. Zajac (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1979). Sec. 8.4 Solving the TISE for a Piecewise-Constant Potential 293 1/JE(X) = 1/J~)(X) 1/J~)(X) -00 < X :5 Xl XN-l :5 X < 00. (8.19) Now that we've identified the regions, we must classify them. We classify each region according to the kinetic energy that a particle with energy E (the energy of the state we are interested in) would have were it in the region. Since E = T + V, the kinetic energy T = E - Vq in region q would be positive or negative depending on the magnitudes of E and Vq â€¢ The two possible cases, E ~ V and E < V, are dubbed classically allowed (CA) and classically forbidden (CF), because a (classical) particle would be \"forbidden\" from a region where its kinetic energy would be zero. We also use this classification scheme in studying continuous potentials V(x) (Chap. 9), so I'll summarize it here for this general case: T= E- V(x) { < 0 if E < V(x) ~ 0 if E ~ V(x) classically forbidden region classically allowed region This scheme is illustrated for the potential of Fig. 8.9a in Table 8.2. A preview of its application to continuous potentials appears in Fig. 8.9b. TABLE 8.2 CLASSIFICATIONS OF REGIONS FOR THE POTENTIAL IN FIG. 8.9a.

The solutions in all CA regions have the same functional form, as do those in all CF regions. So we'll consider each case separately, starting with the CA regions. But first, let's rearrange terms in the TISE (8.16) as ~1/J(q)(X)= - 2m (E - V, )\",.(q) (x) d~ E ~ q o/E (8.20) 294 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I (8.21) Equation (8.20) is just the TISEfor a free particle with E replaced by E - Vq â€¢ Whether region q is CA or CF, this equation has the simple form d~2 function of x = constant x function of x. This form makes it easy to write down the solutions in each case. Suppose the region is classically allowed, so E > ~ . Then Eq. (8.21) is d2 &, â€¢ f . . f . fd x2 runcnon 0 x = - posinve constant x unction 0 x. (8.22) The solution of such an equation, the \"function of x\" in (8.22), is an oscillatory plane wave. To write down such a function, we need to define the wave number k q for the region q as wave numberfor CA region. (8.23) CA region [Xq-l ~ x ~ x q ]. In terms of this wave number, the TISE (8.20) looks like dd~21/J~)(x)= -k~1/J~)(x) (8.24) Now, the second-order ordinary differential equation (8.24) has two linearly inde- pendent solutions . In fact, it has several sets of two linearly independent solutions . For example, it's satisfied by the real functions { sin kqx, cos kqx} real, oscillatory solutions. (8.25) We can write the general solution of Eq. (8.24) as an arbitrary linear combination of the functions (8.25), with coefficients that I'll denote by C(q) and D(q): CA region [Xq-l ~ x ~ x q ]. (8.26) But we need not use the particular linearly independent solutions (8.25). Indeed, we often prefer to use complex exponential functions, because doing so makes it easier to hook the pieces together (Step 4 of our procedure). In a CA region, these alternate solutions are complex, oscillatory solutions. (8.27) In terms of complex functions, we write the general solution-with, of course , different multiplicative coefficients than those in Eq. (8.26)-as I 5 CA region [Xq-l ~ x ~ x q ].

The piece 'l/J~)(x) attains l/e of its maximum value 'l/J~)(Xq) a distance 1/K q from the (left) boundary of the region. Now, one set of linearly independent solutions to Eq. (8.31) iS16 real, exponential solutions. (8.32) In terms of these functions, we write the general solution in a CF region as CF region [Xq-l ~ x ~ x q). (8.33) An alternative form of the general solution can be written in terms of hyperbolic sine and cosine functions. The properties of these functions, along with those of the real exponentials (8.32), are summarized in Table 8.3, and handy graphs of both types of functions appear in Fig. 8.11. Question 8-9 What is the counterpart of Eq. (8.26) for a CF region? (Hint: cos i x = cosh x and sin ix = i sinh x .) (8.34) Using the handy compendia in Table 8.2, we can easily analyze each region of a piecewise-constant potential and write down the piece of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for each region. Of the steps in the procedure at the beginning of this section, there remains only to determine the coefficients in these pieces (and, for a bound state, the quantized energies)-matters we shan get to soon. But first, a couple of examples. Example 8.1. The Potential Step for E < lfo: Act I (The Set-Up) One of the simplest piecewise -constant potentials is the potential step in Fig. 8.12. In this system, a beam of particles incident from the left encounters an impulsive force at x = O. For this potential, we immediately espy two regions: one in which V(x) is zero and one in which V(x) equals a positive constant Vo, i.e., { o x<O V(x) = Vo x 2': o. 16Notice that were we to define a wave number k q , 11 la Eq. (8.23), for a CF region , this quantity would be imaginary. It would, in fact, be related to the decay constant K,q by k q = i K,q . With this substitution the oscillatory functions in (8.27) become the real functions in (8.32). Sec. 8.4 Solving the TISE for a Piecewise-Constant Potential 297 sinh I()( 5.0 -5.0 o cosh I()( Figure 8.11 Solutions of the TISE for a CF region: exploding and decaying exponentials e'<3: and e- K X and hyperbolic functions sinh K,X and cosh K,X for K, = 0.5. 1.0. and 2.0. (See also Table 8.3.) In this example, I'll consider an energy E < Vo, so I can show you how to handle both CA and CF regions. (For E > Vo both regions are CA, right?) The wave numbers for each region are shown in Fig. 8.12, as is the general solution written in terms of \",,~)(x) and \"\"~)(x). I've used the complex exponential fonn (8.28) in Region 1 to facilitate a later step, hooking the pieces together at the boundary x = 0 (see Example 8.3). Now that we have the general solution (Step 2), we must impose physical conditions in the first and last regions (Step 3). To see what physical conditions we need, consider the solution in Region 2, (8.35) Immediately, we spot a problem: one of the linearly independent real exponentials, eK 2\"' . blows up in the limit x ---> 00, which limit is included in Region 2. Such unsightly explosions are common: pieces of \"\"E(X) in semi-infinite CF regions are often plagued by exploding 298 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I V(x) Vo t-----------\"\"'T-- x q= 1 (CA) 1jI~': Oscillatory q = 2 (CF) 1jI~2J: Exponential o~ x o~ x sin k,x cos k 1x Figure 8.12 Analysis of a continuum stationary state of the potential step with E < Vo. exponentials, because the real functions from which they are assembled have the unfortunate properties that e\"X_ oo, x-oo Exploding Exponentials -K,X e ---+ 00 . x - - oc This behavior is just not acceptable: if we are to interpret the wave function lJI(x, t) = 'l/JE(x)e-i Et/ Tt as a position probability amplitude, we must never allow 'l/JE(X) to become infinite-not at a finite value of z, nor in either asymptotic region. To eliminate this exploding exponential, we exploit the arbitrariness of the coefficients in (8.35). In particular, we set the coefficient that multiplies the offending term in 'I/J~)(x) equal to zero: (8.36) Equation (8.36) is called an asymptotic condition. Asymptotic conditions are constraints we must impose on the spatial function to makeit satisfya physical requirement in an asymptotic region. In this instance, the asymptotic condition requires that 'l/JE(X) not blow up as x ~ 00 (in Region 2). (We'll discover another kind of asymptotic condition in Example 8.4, where we consider states with E > Vo.) Such conditions impose physical constraints on the Sec. 8.4 Solving the TISE for a Piecewise-Constant Potential 299 (8.37) (8.38) allowable form of a mathematical solution ; they are of such importance that we dignify them with a rule: Rule Once you have written down the pieces of a Hamiltonian eigenfunction, immediately set to zero all coefficients that multiply exploding exponentials in either asymptotic region (the first and the last regions). We can now assemble the solution to the TlSE for the potential step for any energy E< Yo, { A(1)eikp : + B(I)e- i k 1X x s 0 t/JE(X) = A(2)e-\"' 2X x ~ O. [Incidentally, some authors refer to a decaying exponential such as t/J~)(x) by the more appealing name evanescent wave.] This completes the set-up of the problem of the potential step. Shortly, in Example 8.3, we'll finish this problem by connecting the pieces of the eigenfunction. And we'll return to the potential step for E > Vo in several examples in Â§ 8.5. Question 8-10 Prepare a figure like Fig. 8.12 for the case E > Yo. For such an energy do you need to worry about exploding exponentials? Example 8.2. The (Symmetric) Finite Square Well (The Set-Up) The symmetric finite square well in Fig. 8.13 is as famous in the study of bound states as the potential step is in the study of continuum states. This potent ial is the simplest (realistic) example that illustrates the essentials of bound-state quantum mechanics. In Fig. 8.13 is the set-up for solving the TISE for a bound state of this potential, i.e., for an energy E < Yo. Notice several points: 1. We must enforce two asymptotic conditions, setting coefficients equal to zero in the two CF regions so as to stamp out exploding exponentials. 2. Because the potentials in these CF regions, VI and V3 , are equal, so are the decay constants : X;I = X;3 . 3. We could write the solution in Region 2, t/J~)(x), either in tenns of real trigonometric functions (sin k2 x and cos k2 x ) or in terms of complex expo- nentials (e i k2 X and e- i k2 X). The real functions simplify the ensuing algebra (Example 8.7), so let's choose them. We're now ready to put the pieces together to fonn the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for a bound state (E < Yo), { B(I)e\"'IX -00 < x s -L/2 t/JE(X) = C( 2) cosk 2x + D( 2) sink2x -L/2 ~ x ~ L/2 A(3)e-\"'3 X L/2 ~ x < 00 To complete the solution of the TISE, we must hook these pieces together. This step determines all but one of the coefficients in Eq. (8.38). But since the state we're investigating is bound, its energies are quantized, and we must perform an additional chore: we must 300 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I V(x) h21(~ h21(~ 2r 2m ~ E t h2k~ t 2m (ll (CF) \"'~I: Exponential -~L I I I I I I I I I I I o +~L I I I I I I I I I I I (31 (CF) '\" ~3): Exponential Figure 8.13 Analysis of a bound stationary state of a symmetric finite square well of height Vo and width L. find the values of these quantized energies , the particular eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for which bound stationary-state eigenfunctions exist. I'll defer this chore until Â§ 8.7. Question 8-11 Replicate Fig. 8.13 for the case E > Yo. Write down the pieces of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for such an energy. Is such a state bound or unbound? Why? Aside: Regions and the Nature of Stationary States. The nature of a stationary state (bound or continuum) is intimately related to whether the first and last regions are CA or CF. This connection follows from the conditions (8.7) or (8.8), only one of which is in force for a particular state: Rule A stationary state is bound if and only if the first and last regions are CF. If either region is CA, then there could be a non-zero probability of find- ing the particle in the state represented by w(x, t) = 'l/JE(x)e-iEt/ Tt in the corresponding asymptotic region, so the state is not bound. This rule explains why the state in Example 8.1 is a continuum state even though its probability density decays to zero in Region 2 (i .e., as x -+ +00). A Tale of the Hook Now we come to Step 4 in our procedure for solving the TlSE for a piecewise-constant potential. A piecemeal creature like (8.38) is obviously not a complete solution, for we don't know the coefficients multiplying all the x-dependent factors in it. And there may be a lot of these as-yet-unknown coefficients, for in general Sec. 8.4 Solving the TISE for a Piecewise-Constant Potential 301 N regions 2N constants: {A (q), B(q)} for q = 1, 2, .. . , N (8.39) The TISE within each region tel1s us nothing about the values of these coefficients. So we must consider the region boundaries . We determine the coefficients (8.39) by \"hooking together\" the pieces of the Hamil- tonian eigenfunction at these boundaries. The key to this procedure is found in the familiar mathematical requirements that any state function must satisfy (Chap. 3): \\l1(X, t) must be continuous, finite, single-valued, and smoothly-varying at all x. The consequences of these requirements are the fol1owing conditions: continuity smoothly-varying 1/JE(X) continuous at xq :x 1/JE(X) continuous at x q Continuity Conditions (8.40) Within each region, these conditions are automatical1y satisfied by 1/J~)(x) (see Table 8.3). But, as shown in Fig. 8.14, at the region boundaries , we must enforce them . We do so by again exploiting the arbitrariness of the multiplicative constants in the Hamiltonian eigenfunction (see Example 8.3).17 Enforcing the continuity conditions (8.40) determines al1 but one of the constants in the eigenfunction. The role of this remaining constant depends on the nature of the state: if the state is unbound, this constant reflects conditions in the scattering experiment; if it's bound, this constant enforces normalization of the eigenfunction. We'l1 see continuity conditions in action for bound states in Â§ 8.7. For now, let's apply them to a continuum state of the potential step.

These are not problems to be worried about, but if you'd like to read about them, see D. Branson, Amer. Jour . Phys. 47, !OO (1979) and M. Andrews, ibid. 49, 281 (1981). 302 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I Example 8.3. The Potential Step for E < '\\to: Act II (The Hook) In Example 8.1 we considered a continuum state of the potential step with energy E < Vo and deduced the spatial function (8.37). Applying the continuity conditions (8.40) at the (finite) region boundary x = 0, we obtain two relations between the coefficients A(1), B(1), and B(2), viz., t/J~)(x= 0) = t/J<;)(x = 0) dt/J~)(x)I = dt/J<;)(x) I dx \",=0 dx \",=0 ==> ==> (8.4Ia) Equations (8.41) are two simultaneous algebraic equations in three unknowns. Solving them, we can evaluate two unknowns in terms of the third. For example, we can determine B(1) and A(2) in terms of A(l) . Here's how. Multiplying (8.4Ia) by K.2 and adding the result to (8.41b), we find B(l) ik l + K.2 k l - iK.2 A(l) = ik l - K.2 = k l + iK.2 â€¢ (8.42a) (I've rearranged the terms in this result to obtain a cleaner form). Similarly, we find A(2) 2k l A(l) = k l + iK.2 . (8.42b) Now, using Eqs. (8.42), we can write the eigenfunction (8.37) in terms of one (still- unknown) coefficient, to wit: x$O x ~ O. (E < Yo) (8.43) Note that the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for E < Vo is complex and that the (evanescent) wave in Region 2 is a decaying exponential, not a travelling wave. As desired, the eigenfunction (8.42) is everywhere continuous and smoothly varying. In the next section, I'll finish this example and will unveil the physical significance of the remaining coefficient, A (I), and explain how we choose it to match the experimental (scattering) situation. We'I1 also learn how to determine from t/Je(x) the probabilities for reflection and transmission in continuum-state problems. I want to emphasize that nowhere (thus far) have I distinguished the problem- solving strategy we use for bound states from that for continuum states. To be sure, the differences between bound and continuum states (Table 8.1) have influenced several of our actions, e.g., specification of the piece of the eigenfunction in the first and/or last regions, and the asymptotic conditions that may have to be imposed on these pieces. But the basic procedure outlined at the start of this section holds for either kind of state: identify regions, classify them, write down the piece for each region, and hook the pieces together. For either kind of state, the solution in each region is a linear combination of simple, analytic functions (Table 8.3), although the particular form of each of these functions depends on whether the region is CA or CF. So you don't really have to learn two different problem-solving methods to handle the two different kinds of states. Isn't that nice? Sec. 8.4 Solving the TISE for a Piecewise-Constant Potential 303 8.5 THE INTERPRETATION OF CONTINUUM-STATE EIGENFUNCTIONS ..There is work to be done.\" --Count Dracula in Dracula by Bram Stoker To solve scattering problems, we use continuum stationary-state functions such as the pure momentum function of Chap. 4 (cf., Â§ 8.3). Two quantities are essential to the interpretation of continuum stationary states: the reflection and transmission coefficients R(E) and T(E). Although these quantities are called \"coefficients,\" they're actually probabilities. They answer the question, what is the probability that an electron incident from the left with energy E will be reflected (or transmitted) by its encounter with a potential V(x)? In this section, I'll introduce these coefficients via the corresponding probability amplitudes. The reflection and transmission coefficients are defined in terms of the incident. reflected. and transmitted fluxes. These quantities are the probability current densities for the possible outcomes of the collision. We can calculate these current densities from the pieces of the continuum stationary-state function 1/JE(X), provided each piece corresponds to a travelling wave or to a standing wave , which is just a superposition of travelling waves. For example, the piece of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction (8.43) (for the potential step) that corresponds to Region 1 is a sum of two terms. One corresponds to a travelling wave propagating in the +x direction (the e i k 1X term), the other to a wave propagating in the -x direction (the e- i k 1X term). These are the incident and reflected waves, respectively. (8.44b) (8.44a)number of particles per unit length number of particles incident on I m 2 area perpendicular to the beam Aside: A quick review. The pure momentum functions Ae i (p x-Et)/Ii and Ae-i(px+Et)/1i represent travelling waves that propagate in the +x and -x direc- tions, respectively. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the momentum of the first wave is +p and that of the second is -po For a pure momentum state that represents a state of a beam of non-interacting particles. the probability density is (cf., Â§ 6.8-6.9) P(x, t) = IAI2 = j(x, t) = Â±.E.IAI2 = m Example 8.4. The Potential Step for E > yo: Act III (Reflection and Transmission Coefficients) Let's work out the reflection and transmission coefficients for the eigenfunction (8.37) of Example 8.3. The piece of this function in Region I of the potential step consists of two travelling waves: tP~)(x) = A(I)e i k 1X +B(I)e- i k 1X. ----- -------- inci d e nt reflected (8.45) This function is a superposition of an incident wave of amplitude IA(1)1 and a reflected wave of amplitude IBO) I. 304 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I We can use the ratio B(I) fA(I ) from Eq. (8.42a) to calculate the amplitude of the reflected wave. We find, interestingly, that IB(I)I = IA(I)I . That is, in Region I two waves of equal amplitude travel in opposite directions at the same phase velocity. [That's why tP~)(x), the superposition of these waves, is an (oscillatory) standing wave.) Because the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves are equal, the total probability flow into or out of this region is zero.18 This means that every particle in the incident beam (with E < Vo) will be reflected by its encounter with the step at x = O. The probability of reflection is therefore unity, and that of transmission is zero: R(E) = 1 T(E) = 0 [potential step for E < Vol. (8.46) (8.47) (8.48) This result is just what we'd expect were we applying classical physics to this problem. But don't be misled by this coincidence. As we'll see in Examples 8.5 and 8.6, the reflection and transmission coefficients for E > Vo violate our classical expectations. The interpretation we've applied to tP~)(x)doesn't fit the piece of tPE(X) in Region 2. This function isn't a travelling wave; it is a decaying-or evanescent-wave. Its amplitude IA(2)1 = IA(I)I 2k l e- K2 X Jkr +II:~ decreases with increasing x in Region 2 at a \"decay rate\" given by the decay constant 11:2, as you can see from the probability density in Fig. 8.15. This finding is consistent with our discovery [Eq. (8.46Â») that all incident particles with E < Vo are reflected. No probability flow is associated with an evanescent wave. Question 8-12 Prove that the probability current density for the function e-Kxe-iEt/1i is zero. Reflection and Transmission of Particles by the Potential Step The predictions of quantum mechanics for the behavior of a beam of particles with energy E < Vo that impinges on the potential step conform to the predictions of classical physics that such particles will be reflected but not transmitted. But how about particles with E > Vo? Well, classical physics predicts that such particles will be transmitted but not reflected. Let's see what quantum physics predicts . Example 8.5. A Second Look at the Potential Step: (E > \\10) In Question 8-9, you determined the general form of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for a state of the potential step with E > Vo, obtaining { tP~)(x) = A(1)e i k p : + B(1)e- i k 1X -00 < x s 0 tPE(X) = tP~)(x) = A(2)e i k 2 x + B(2)e- i k 2 X 0:::; x < 00 . 18Anolher way to see this feature of 1f>~)(x) is to write this function in terms of real oscillatory solutions (8.25), viz., (1) 2A(I) 1f>E (x)=---[k\\cosk\\x-K2Sink\\x). kl +K2 The x dependence in this result is that of a standing wave.

For such a state, both regions are classically allowed, and the wave numbers in the pieces of the eigenfunction (8.48) are (q = 1,2). (8.49) In this example , we'll hook these pieces together. Then , in Example 8.6, we'll calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for this state. Before applying the continuity conditions, we must consider the asymptotic condi- tions. Each piece of (8.48) is oscillatory, so we needn't cope with exploding exponentials. But there is nonetheless an asymptotic condition we must enforce if the general form (8.48) is to conform to the experiment. To see the origin of this condition, note first that we can interpret each term of each piece as a travelling wave. To clarify this point, let's write the time-dependent state function corresponding to Eq. (8.49), -00 < x $ 0 0$ x < 00. (8.500) The angular frequencies in this function correspond to the wave numbers (8.49) : they are /ik~ E - Vq wq = 2m = --/i- (q = 1,2). Now, consider Eq. (8.500) in light of Table 8.4. Do you see the problem? (8.50b) 306 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I (8.51) TABLE 8.4 PIECES OF THE EIGENFUNCTION FOR THE POTENTIAL STEP WITH E> Vo Term in tPE(X) Interpretation A(t)e i k 1X incident wave (momentum +hkt) B(l)e- i k 1X reflected wave (momentum -hkl) A(2)ei k 2 X transmitted wave (momentum +hk2) B(2)e- i k 2 X incident wave (momentum -hk2) The problem is that one term in Eq. (8.50a) does not conform to the experimental arrangement in this example: a beam of panicles incident from the left on the potential step V(x) . This arrangement does not include a source of panicles traveIling to the left (with momentum -lik 2 ) . So to make our mathematical solution conform to the physical experiment, we must set B( 2) = 0 in Eqs. (8.48) and (8.50a). Like the asymptotic condition that prohibits exploding exponentials, the requirement that the eigenfunction we construct must conform to the experimental set-up is a consequence of the physics that we impose on the mathematics: Rule Once you have written down the pieces of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction, set to zero any coefficients that multiply incident travelling-wave terms for which there is no source in your experiment. Putting together the remaining pieces and using the continuity conditions (8.40) to hook them together, we obtain for the continuum function for a state with energy E > Vo the astounding result { A(l) [ei k 1X + (:: ~::) e- i k 1X ] x s 0 tPE(X) = (E> Vo) A(l) (~) ei k 2 X x ~ 0 k 1 +k 2 What is astounding in this result is the reflected travelling wave in Region 1 . The presence of this term means that for E > Vo, we'll find T(E) < 1 and R(E) :f; O. These predictions are quite different from those of classical physics . Indeed, it's impossible to understand from classical arguments how a panicle with E> Vo could be reflected by the step. We'll evaluate these probabilities in the grand finale, Example 8.6. Question 8-13 Fill in the steps leading to Eqs. (8.51). You can do this using our straightforward hooking procedure or, more easily , by thinking about how this state differs from the one in Eq. (8.43) . Question 8-14 Graph the probability density for a state with E> Vo (cf., Fig. 8.15). The Reflection and Transmission Coefficients The form of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction in Example 8.5 is typical of continuum stationary states (for a beam incident from the left): Sec. 8.5 The Interpretation of Continuum-State Eigenfunctions 307 { incident-wave tenn + reflected-wave term \"source region\" tPE(X} = transmitted-wave term \"detector region\" (8.52) The terms source region and detector region in (8.52) explicitly remind us where the source and the detector are. We note two \"scattered waves,\" the reflected wave and the transmitted wave, each of which represents one possible outcome of the encounter of the particles in the incident beam with the potential step. To clarify the role of these scattered waves, let's express them in terms of the incident amplitude. To this end, we'll define a quantity p(E} that relates the amplitude of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave: (8.53a) The counterpart of this quantity for the transmitted wave is (8.53b) These quantities (which may be complex) are probability amplitudes: p(E} is the reo flection probability amplitude and r(E} the transmission probability amplitude. In terms of these amplitudes, we can write the general eigenfunction (8.52) cs (E> Yo). (8.54) Now, from these probability amplitudes we can calculate the reflection and trans- mission coefficients. To do so, we return to the probability current densities-the fluxes- for the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. For each wave, we'll obtain the prob- ability current density by substituting the appropriate piece of tPE(X} into the definition of this quantity. Then we'll call upon Eq. (8.52) to help us interpret these densities. Let's do it. By definition, the probability current density for tP~)(x} is (8.55) [Don't forget that each of the pieces tP~)(x} is only part of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction; the probability current density for the full stationary-state eigenfunction, j(x, t}, is zero.] Inserting the pieces from (8.54) into this definition, we obtain source region (8.56) detector region. What does this result mean physically? Well, look first at Region I. In this region the probability current density j is the sum of an incident flux jill!' and a reflected flux jT eR. In Region 2, the current density j is the transmitted flux jtralls' If we identify these fluxes as 308 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I jine == tikI IA (l) 12 m jrefl == - TikI IA(1)12Ip(E W m jtrans == Tik2IA(1)12Ir (E W , m (8.57a) (8.57b) (8.57c) we can write the current density as . { jine + jrefl J= . Jtrans source region detector region. (8.58) Notice that the reflected flux jrefl must carry a minus sign, because the momentum of the reflected wave is -Tik 1 (i.e., this wave \"travels\" in the -x direction) . Also note the presence in Eqs. (8.57) of the squared moduli of the reflection and transmitted probability amplitudes p(E) and r(E). Such factors are just what we'd expect to find in probabilities. And, indeed, the step to the reflection and transmission probabilities is a small one. The reflection probability R(E), for example, is equal to the fraction of particles in the incident beam that are reflected. This fraction is simply the ratio of the reflected flux to the incident flux [see Eq. (8.44b)]. Making a similar argument for the transmission coefficient, we arrive at the definitions R(E) = Ij.refll = Ip(EW IJinel T(E) = Ijt.ransl = kN Ir(EW. iJinel k1 (8.59) Note carefully the ratio of wave numbers k N /k 1 in the transmission coefficient. Many novice problem solvers forget this factor and wind up with grossly erroneous transmission coefficients (unless the potential is such that V1 = VN). Coefficients like those in (8.59) are the cornerstones of quantum collision theory (in one dimension). For more complicated problems, we can develop expressions for these coefficients using the procedure of this section: we work from the probability current densities and from our interpretation of the terms in the Hamiltonian eigenfunction as incident, reflected, and travelling waves. In the next section, we'll work through a more strenuous example of this procedure. But first, we've got to finish off the potential step. Example 8.6. The Last of the Potential Step for E > va Little remains to be done. To determine the reflection and transmission coefficients for this case , we just read the corresponding amplitudes off the eigenfunction (8.51) and substitute them into the definitions (8.59), obtaining (8.60)(E> Vo) R(E) = Ip(E)1 2 = (k 1 - k2)2 kl +k2 T(E) = k21r(E)1 2 = 4k1k2 Â». (k 1 + k2 )2 Since each incident particle must be either reflected or transmitted, the sum of these proba- bilities must equal one, R(E) + T(E) = 1. (8.61) Sec. 8.5 The Interpretation of Continuum-State Eigenfunctions 309 This requirement is a useful check on our algebra. In contrast to Eq. (8.46) for E < Voâ€¢ our results (8.60) for E > Vo do not conform to the predictions of classical physics. They do. however. agree with laboratory findings. Question 8-15 In Eq. (8.46) we deduced the reflection and transmission coefficients for states of the poten- tial step with E < Vo. Verify these deductions with a calculation based on the eigenfunction (8.43) and the definitions (8.59). Question 8-16 Solve the TISE and calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for scattering by the potential step of a particle with E = Vo. Generalization and Summary We have seen how to solve the TISE for continuum states of a piecewise-constant po- tential and how to interpret the resulting eigenfunctions to obtain scattering information: the probabilities of reflection and transmission. Although we have worked only with the potential step, which contains but a single point of discontinuity, the method of this sec- tion easily generalizes to more complicated piecewise-constant potentials, such as those in Fig. 8.16. In fact, the only difference between the solution of the present example and the procedure for finding the reflection and transmission coefficients for a piecewise-constant potential with an arbitrary number of discontinuities is the quantity and complexity of the algebra involved. If we label the final region (where the detector is located) by N, we can write the solution of the TISE in the source and detector regions as a simple generalization of the form (8.54) for the potential step.l? For example, if, as in Fig. 8.16, the energy of the state satisfies E > VI and E > VN, then the eigenfunction is 1/JE(X) = (8.62) If, as in (8.62), the pieces of the eigenfunction in the source and detector regions corre- spond to travelling waves, then both reflection and transmission are possible, and both R(E) and T(E) are non-zero and less than one. But if E < VN , then the wave in the detector region is evanescent, and the probability of transmission is zero. 191n problems with many regions. we may not need to solve for all the pieces of the eigenfunct ion.

So although quantum mechanics predicts penetration into the CF Sec. 8.6 Tunnelling for Fun and Profit 311 region of this potential-i.e., the probability density in this region is non-zero-we can't demonstrate this phenomenon in the laboratory. But we can demonstrate penetration into a CF region if we \"chop off' the potential step, changing it into the barrier of width L in Fig. 8.17,20 V(x) = {~ x<O O~x~L. x>L (8.65) According to quantum physics, particles with E < Vo incident on the barrier from the left will penetrate the potential and be transmitted into the classically-allowed region beyond, where we can detect them. This is the amazing, wholly non-classical phenomenon of tunnelling-the topic of this section.

Tunnelling is a fascinating phenomenon, both in its own right and for its many applications. For example, tunnelling explains the existence of doublets in the vibrational spectra of the ammonia molecule (NH3 ) due to inversion of its nuclear geometry, a property that is important in the design of atomic clocks and the ammonia beam maser;21 the emission of alpha particles from a radioactive nucleus, which is relevant to reactor design;22 and the field emission of electrons.P And barrier penetration is important 2Â°Ordinarily, the symmetry of a potential such as the one in Fig. 8.17 would argue for choosing x = 0 at the midpoint of the barrier. But in this problem, we can simplify the algebra slightly by choosing the origin at one of the region boundaries, the points at which we must apply continuity conditions . And in this problem, we need all the help we can get. 21See Â§ 12.2 of Atomic and Space Physics by A. E. S. Greene and P. J. Wyatt (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1965). 22Seeâ€¢ for example, Â§ 4-5 of Elements of Nuclear Physics by W. E. Meyerhoff (New York: McGraw- Hill, 1967). 23See T. Ando, A. B. Fowler. and F.

This amazing device is based on the penetration by electrons near the surface of a solid sample through the barrier at the surface. These electrons form a \"cloud\" of probability outside the sample. Although the probability of detecting one of these elec- trons decays exponentially with distance from the surface, one can induce and measure a current of these electrons, and thereby attain a magnification factor of 100 million- large enough to permit resolution of a few hundredths the size of an atom! For this development, Drs. Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer won half of the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics.f'' In this section, we're going to solve for the transmission coefficient for particles incident on a potential banier. I've devoted a full section to tunnelling because I want to raise your algebraic consciousness. This is (algebraically) the most complicated problem we have yet encountered, and it offers a chance to learn some nifty organizational and problem-solving tricks that are vital to the mastery of the art and craft of quantum physics. So get out paper and pencil and follow along.26 The set-Up The regions of the banier potential and their classification for a state with E < Vo appear in Fig. 8.17. For this potential, there is but a single wavenumber (for Regions I and 3) and a single decay constant (for Region 2), so to simplify the ensuing algebra, I've dropped the region labels from these quantities. I've also applied the asymptotic condition to 'l/J~)(x) to make the composite eigenfunction conform to an experiment in which particles are incident from the left . Our next step is to apply the continuity conditions (8.40) at the boundaries x = 0 and x = L . These conditions and a little algebra lead directly to the ratio of the transmitted to incident flux-the very quantity we need to determine the transmission coefficient T(E) [see Eq. (8.59)]. So we'll first evaluate the transmission probability amplitude r(E), the ratio of the amplitude of the transmitted wave A(3) to that of the incident wave, A (1) .27 From Continuity Conditions to Scattering Probabilities The results of applying continuity conditions to the pieces of the Hamiltonian eigen- function in Fig. 8.17 appear in Table 8.5. Using these equations, we can relate A (3) to A (1) . One fairly efficient route to this relationship is to move from Region 1 \"through 24For a practical look at this application, see Chap. 9 of Experiments in Modern Physics by A. C. Melissinos (New York: Academic Press. 1966). You can find a great deal more about tunnelling in Quantum Mechanical Tunnelling and its Applications by D. Roy (Philadelphia: Taylor and Francis. 1987). 25See G. Binning and H. Rohrer. Sci. Amer. 253. 50. (1985) and C. F. Quate, Physics Today 39. 26 (1986). 26Readers interested in an alternate approach that bypasses some of the algebraic machinery I want to introduce should peruse the two useful papers by J. E. Draper. Amer . Jour . Phys. 47.525 (1979) and ibid., 48. 749 (1980). 27Similarly. we can evaluate the reflection coefficient R( E) from the ratio of B( 1 ) to A (1) . I'll do only the transmission coefficient. leaving reflection for you to ponder as a problem.

We don't need eÂ», so let's get rid of it: Step 1. eliminate B(l) by deriving an equation relating A(l), A(2), and B(2). Step 2. Next we must relate A (3) to the ratio A (2) / B(2): derive expressions for A(2) and for B(2) in terms of A(3) . Step 3. This sets us up to complete the problem: combine the results of steps 1 and 2 to obtain an expression for the ratio A (3) / A (1) . Step 1 is easy: we just multiply Eq. (8.66) by ik and add it to Eq. (8.67), obtaining 2ikA(I) = (ik - I\\':)A(2) + (ik + I\\':)B(2). (8.70) Step 2 entails two manipulations. Multiplying Eq. (8.68) by -I\\': and adding the result to Eq.

(8.73) This step doesn't complete the problem, but Eq. (8.73) is an important intermediate result. This ratio is useful, for example , in the analysis of limiting cases such as a very fat barrier or a high-energy state (see below) . But before investigating these special cases, we'll use Eq. (8.73) to derive the transmission coefficient. To make this task a bit easier, I want to first simplify the form of this ratio. 314 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I Crafty Simplifications The grail of our quest is the transmission coefficient I A(3) 1 2 (A(3)) (A(3)). T(E) = A(l) = A(l) A(l) (8.74) But working with an expression as complicated as (8.73) is fraught with peril. If your imagination is in good working order, you may be able to visualize the algebraic swamp we would enter were we to just plug Eq. (8.73) into (8.74). As we perform the necessary algebraic manipulations to obtain a workable expression for T(E), it's very easy to omit one or another of the multitude of symbols in this expression, to switch + and - signs, or to omit a power, or ... . One way to minimize the likelihood of such blunders is to introduce intermediate quantities that simplify the form of the equation we're manipulating.I\" For example, it usually helps to write our result in terms of dimensionless constants. One such constant is the ratio of the wave number k to the decay constant K, a quantity I'll call f3: k f3 =-- . K (8.75) (8.76) (8.77) To write the ratio (8.73) in terms of f3, let's multiply its numerator and denominator by 1/(4K 2 ) : A(3) i (!) .__ = I< e-tkL A(l) [(~+4~)2e-KL_(~-4~)2eI<L] . The form of the denominator in (8.76) suggests the definition of a second intermediate quantity, a=(~+~~). Notice that a and its complex conjugate appear in the denominator of (8.76). With these definitions in hand, we can write the amplitude ratio (8.76) in the more malleable form (8.78) (8.79) Inserting this form into equation (8.74) for T(E) we easily obtain f32 T(E) = ) . a2aÂ· 2(e- 2I<L + e21<L) - (aÂ· 4 + a 4 This formula is still far from elegant, and exploring its mathematical features, graphing it, examining it in various limiting cases, and programming it efficiently on a hand calculator or personal computer are likely to be awkward chores. So let's try to simplify it further. 211The gambits I'm going to illustrate are standard operating procedure for problem solvers. So please don't think of them as restricted to just this example; instead, remember them as tricks of wide applicability. Sec. 8.6 Tunnelling for Fun and Profit 315 (8.800) (8.80b) Gazing at Eq. (8.79), we notice in its denominator a pair of exponentials that differ only in their sign: e- 2f<L and e2f<L . We can write the difference of these functions as a hyperbolic sine function, viz., e- 2f<L + e2f<L = (e-f<L _ ef<L)2 + 2 = 4sinh2 KL+ 2. And we can write the sum of a*4 and a 4 in terms of a completed square, as a*4+ a4= [(a 2-a*2f +2a*2 a2] = [-.a2+2a*2a2] . Now, inserting Eqs. (8.80) in (8.79), we obtain a more tractable form for the transmission coefficient for a potential barrier, our final result Investigating the Transmission Coefficient forE<Vo (8.81a) Having gone to all this work, let's look at the transmission coefficient in several alternate forms: (8.81b) (8.81c) (8.81d) Each of these forms displays a different kind of information. For example, Eq. (8.81c) highlights the dependence of T( E) on k and K, and (8.81d) shows its dependence on the energy E. Question 8-17 Derive Eqs. (8.81). Question 8-18 Show that the reflection coefficient for E < Vo is given by [ ] - 1 R E _ sinh2 \"L 1 + sinh2 \"L ()-4(~)(1-~) 4(~)(1-~) ' (8.82) [There are two ways to do this exercise: easy and hard. Think: what condition must T(E) and R(E) satisfy? Now, what is the easy way?] Although this result is easily derived, it's inelegant. How many useful alternate forms for R( E) can you devise? 316 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I (8.83) Question 8-19 Consider a state with E > Vo. There are two ways to derive the transmission coefficient: the hard and the easy. The hard way is to go through algebraic contortions like those that led us to Eq. (8.8Ia) (doing so is, however, useful practice). The easy way is to set up the problem-as I did for E < Vo in Fig. 8.17-and then to think carefully about how the present problem differs mathematically from the example we just solved. Solve this exercise the easy way, showing that in terms of the wave number in the region 0 :::; x :::; L , k2 = J~\":(E - Vo), the transmission coefficient is T(E) = [1_ sin 2 k2L ] -1 4(~)(1-~) E>Vo (8.84) The transmission coefficient of Eqs. (8.81) is on display in Fig. 8.18. This figure shows two \"views\" of barrier penetration. For completeness, it also includes the coef- ficient for the continuum states of Question 8-19, i.e., those whose energies are greater than the barrier height. The results in this figure are nothing less than remarkable. Look at Fig. 8.18a and compare its implications to your classical expectations. Classical physics would predict that no particles with E < Vo are transmitted; quantum mechanics reveals that the probability of transmission of such particles increases hyperbolically with increasing energy. The other case is equally confounding: classical physics would predict that all incident particles with E > Vo are transmitted; quantum mechanics shows that this condition-s-called total transmission-occurs only at a few discrete energies. An incident particle with an energy E > Vo that lies between these special values may be reflected. The probability that such a reflection will occur diminishes rapidly with increasing E . For another perspective on transmission and reflection by a barrier, look at Fig. 8.18b. In this graph, the energy E and the barrier height Vo are fixed and T(E) is plotted as a function of the barrier width L . This figure shows another bizarre result: for a given energy E, only barriers of certain widths will transmit all particles of this energy. (Such barriers are said to be \"transparent.\") But there is no value of the width such that a barrier of this width reflects all incident particles, because for all values of L, the reflection coefficient R(E) is less than one. Question 8-20 Denote by A2 the de Broglie wavelength in the barrier region, 0 :::; x :::; L . How is A2 related to the special widths L at which total transmission occurs? Question 8-21 The transmission and reflection coefficients tell only part of the story. Derive the ratios of B(1), A (2) , and B(2) to A (1), and use your results to write down an explicit form for 'l/JE(X). Consider both cases: E> Vo and E < Vo. The probabilities of Fig. 8.18 are one step removed from the eigenfunction of Question 8-21. In Fig. 8.19, you'll find a graph of the real part of this (complex) function for an energy E < Vo. Notice the penetration of the barrier and the oscillatory Sec . 8.6 Tunnelling for Fun and Profit 317 T(E) o -.,,-\"'T\"--...........---- - - -- --- Fixed L Total transmission (a) TIE) o Total transmission (b) Fixed Voâ€¢ E L Figure 8.18 The transmission coefficient for barrier penetration (a) as a function of E for fixed Vo and L, and (b) as a function of L for fixed Vo and E > Vo.

Because of the hyperbolic decay of the eigenfunction in the CF region, the amplitude of the eigenfunction in the detector region, x ~ L (and hence its probability density in this region), is reduced from its value in the source region . (Don't be misled by the oscillations in the region x ~ L; the only wave in this region is the transmitted wave, so the probability density there is constant.) Question 8-22 Suppose we change the sign of Vo so that the barrier in Fig. 8.17 becomes a potential well (see Fig. 8.16). Consider a continuum stationary state of this potential well (E > 0). How can you trivially derive from Eq. (8.8le) an expression for T(E) for this case? Aside: Scattering Theory in Three Dimensions. We now leave scattering problems and continuum states for a while. So I would like to close this section by relating what we have learned about scattering problems in the real (three-dimensional) world. In three dimensions, forward scattering (transmission) and backward scattering (re- flection) are two of an infinite number of possibilities. The \"detection probability\" for scattering is the differential cross section do/dO.. The value of this quantity at angles 9 and 'P (see Fig. 8.6) is the probability that a particle will be detected at these angles. The corresponding probability amplitude is called the scattering amplitude; 318 Chap.S States of a Particle in One Dimension I V(x) E----------I-----+--------- o L x (8.85) t/iE(X)t ~~...Y'I\\I\\I\\I â€¢-----v'JTJ VO L VVVV x Figure 8.19 The probability density It/JE(X)1 2 for a continuum state of a particle in- cident on a barrier.

The relationship of amplitude to probability is the familiar one. ~(8,cp)= If(E j8,cp)12 â€¢ In one dimension, we have peE) = feE; 8 = 0) and T(E) = feE; 8 = 71'). To finish our look at tunnelling, here's a historical note on the impact its discovery had on the developing field of quantum physics. Emilio Segre has discussed the im- portance of this discovery in his splendid book From Atoms to Quarks (Berkeley, Ca.: University of California Press, 1980). Some of you may be able to identify with Lord Rutherford in the following remark : George Gamow and Edward U. Condon with R. W. Gurney independently discovered the transparency of potential barriers and applied it to the explanation of the apparent paradoxes of nuclear alpha decay. This result deeply impressed Rutherford , who had been somewhat skeptical about a theory involving so much mathematics and so little intuition. 8.7 BOUND STATES OF THE FINrrE SQUARE WELL Having probed the mysteries of scattering states, we now tum to bound states. The bound- state counterpart to the extended continuum-state example of Â§ 8.6 is the symmetric finite square well of Fig. 8.20b, { Vo -00 < x < -~ V(x) = 0 _~< x <-~ 2 Vo ~Sx<oo In this section and the next, we'll solve for the eigenfunctions (and quantized energies) of this system , Sec. 8.7 Bound States of the Finite Square Well 319 (8.86) A significant difference between the bound- and continuum-state problems follows from the central contrasts between these two types of states: their boundary conditions [Eq. (8.7) versus Eq. (8.8)] and their allowed energies . A major difficulty in solving the TISE for bound states is that we don't know the allowed, quantized energies in advance . We must find these values by solving for Hamiltonian eigenfunctions that obey the boundary conditions \"pe(x) -40 as x -4 Â±oo. Only such solutions can be normalized, I: \"pE(X)\"pE(X) dx = 1, and only normalized eigenfunctions yield a normalized wave function WE(X,t). Qualitative Deductions Rather than solve this problem by grinding out a \"cookbook\" implementation of the general procedure at the beginning of Â§ 8.4, I would like to show you some shortcuts- tricks of the trade that may dramatically reduce the algebraic complexity of this problem. Our first guideline for determining qualitative solutions to quantum problems is Rule Try to deduce as much as possible about the stationary-state eigenfunctions and energies by drawing analogies to states of a system you have already solved. (8.87)n = 1,2,3, . .. , The first cousin of the finite square well is the infinite square well (Chap. 7). (I strongly recommend that you stop reading now, go back, and review this example.) In Example 7.2, we showed that this potential supports an infinite number of bound stationary states, with energies [Eq. (7.49)] 2Ti2 E(oo) = 2_1T__ n n 2mL2 and eigenfunctions-? n = 1,3,5, . .. (8.88) n = 2,4,6, . .. The first few spatial functions \"p~00 ) (x) are shown in Fig. 7.4, a glance at which reminds us that each eigenfunction (8.88) has definite parity; i.e., each is either even or odd under inversion through the midpoint of the well. In this system, the parity of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions mirrors the parity of the trigonometric functions: sinh --+ sin(-kx) = -sinkx odd x--x coskx --+ cos(-kx) = +cos kx even x - - x 291 have introduced the label (00) on the spatial functions and energies to distinguish them from the solutions for the finite well. which we'll determine in this section. 320 Chap.S States of a Particle in One Dimension I Another important property of the infinite-well eigenfunctions is that .,p~00) (x) has n - 1 nodes, finite values of x at which .,p~oo)(x)= O. Now let's use these properties to sketch the bound-state eigenfunctions of the finite well (8.85). Here's what we already know about these functions. In Example 8.2, we classified the regions of the finite square well for bound states (states with energy E < Yo). From the arguments of Â§ 8.4, we expect the eigenfunctions in the CA region (Region 2) to be oscillatory and those in the CF regions (Regions 1 and 3) to be decaying exponentials. (Remember that in the latter regions we must apply asymptotic conditions to guard against exploding exponentials.) Consider the ground state, .,p1(X). The ground state of the infinite well, a simple cosine function, appears in Fig. 8.20a. To draw its counterpart for the finite well, we must somehow distort this cosine function so as to obtain a continuous and smoothly- varying function that is oscillatory for -L/2 :5 x :5 L/2 and that decays exponentially for x < -L/2 and x > L/2. We do so by letting the cosine function \"relax\" so that at the \"walls\" this function goes to a finite value, rather than to zero (see Fig. 8.20b). Because of this change, the wavelength of .,pI(x) is slightly larger than that of .,p~00) (x). This increase in the wavelength allows the cosine function to \"spill over\" into the CF regions. One further change is necessary to freserve the normalization condition (8.86), which requires that the area under !.,pE(x) I be equal to one: the amplitude of .,pI(x) in the CA region is slightly smaller than the amplitude of .,p~00) (x) in this region. (a) (b) (8.89) Figure 8.20 Sketches of the eigenfunctions for the ground states of (a) an infinite square well of width L . and (b) a finite square well of the same width and height Vo. Notice that this sketch of .,pI(x) preserves two crucial properties of the correspond- ing infinite-well function: its symmetry and its number of nodes. When we distort an eigenfunction of the infinite well to produce an eigenfunction of the symmetric finite well, we must take care to preserve these properties-because in the limit Vo -.. 00 any bound-state eigenfunction of the finite well must transform smoothly into the correspond- ing eigenfunction of the infinite well. What can we deduce about the ground-state energy of the finite well? Well, this energy is related to the de Broglie wavelength in Region 2 by h 2k 2 4rr2h 2 E= 2m = 2mA2' So an increase in Aresults in a decrease in E. That is, because the de Broglie wavelength of .,pI (x) in Region 2 is slightly larger than that of its infinite counterpart, E 1 must be slightly smaller than E~00) â€¢ Sec. 8.7 Bound States of the Finite Square Well 321 Question 8-23 Sketch the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions for the first and second excited states of the finite square well. On an energy-level diagram like Fig. 7.3, locate (approximately) the energies of the first three stationary states, showing their proximity to the bound-state energies of the infinite well. This process of deducing qualitative information about complicated physical sys- tems is not magic. You can do it. The principles I have applied are simple and familiar: 1. the uniqueness of 1/JE(X) for a bound-state of a one-dimensional potential; 2. the normalization requirement (8.86); 3. the fact that a symmetric potential implies eigenfunctions of definite parity. The latter property is so important that I'll summarize as followsr'? V(x) -----+ V( -x) = V(x) x-+-x n = 1,3,5, . n = 2,4,6, . even parity odd parity Thus, as we saw in Chap. 7, the ground state eigenfunction of the infinite well is even, and the excited-state eigenfunctions alternate parity with increasing n. In Chap. 9 we'll prove that this property is characteristic of all symmetric potentials: n = 2 3 4 parity = even odd even odd The moral-words to live by when solving problems-is Rule THINK BEFORE YOU DERIVE-and THINK SYMMETRY These principles aid us not only in our quest for qualitative understanding of quantum systems, but also in the quantitative solution of the TISE, as in the next example. Example 8.7. Solving the TISE for the Finite Square Well (with the Least Possible Work) Let's return to the procedure of Â§ 8.4. So far, we've identified and classified the regions of the finite square well, defined the necessary wave numbers and decay constants, and written down the pieces of the eigenfunction in the CA and CF regions (see Fig. 8.13). [Because of the parity condition, the piece of each eigenfunction in Region 2 will be a sine or a cosine 30Be wary of the quantum numbers we use 10 label Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. For most one- dimensional systems, iI'S conventional to choose n = 110 label the ground state. But for some problems, such as the simple harmonic oscillator of Chap. 9. we pick n = 0 10 label the ground stale. The point 10 remember is that Ihe parity of a state is a basic property of its eigenfunction, not a consequence of the index we use 10 label it. 322 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I function: so it makes sense to choose the real trigonometric form for tP~)(x).l The next step is applying the continuity conditions at the region boundaries. To reduce the algebra involved in this step, let's take into account the symmetry of the functions we're trying to find. The parity of these functions enables us to separate the problem into two simpler problems, one for even-parity states and one for odd-parity states. That is, the general forms of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions are 3 l { Be\" x tPn(x) = Ccoskx Ae-I<x -00 < x ~-~ -~ ~ x ~ ~ ~~x<oo (8.90) for n = I, 3, 5, . .. (even parity) for n = 2, 4, 5, . .. (odd parity) Question 8-24 Suppose we were to use the fonn of tP~ffl(x) (8.28), in which the exponentials e i k x and e- i k x appear. Write down this fonn for the finite square well and show that the only linear combination of these exponentials that have the necessary parity are, in fact, cos kx and sin kx . Figure 8.21 The pieces of a bound stationary-state eigenfunction of the finite square well in the classically-forbidden regions. Note the symmetry of these pieces of even- and odd-parity states. Now let's apply the continuity conditions (8.40) at the region boundaries, x = -L/2 and x = L/2. We can use the power of parity to simplify this step dramatically by relating the piece of tPE(X) in the CF Region I to the piece in the other CF Region, 2. Look carefully at Fig. 8.21: if x is any point in Region 3, then the parity conditions (8.89) imply (8.91) 31 111 this section, I'll write equations such as (8.90), which pertain to two cases, with the even-parity case on the left and the odd-parity case on the right. So if you wish, you can read along the left column first, then go back and read the right column. The index n will, as we'll soon see, label the allowed (quantized) values of It and k. Sec. 8.7 Bound States of the Finite Square Well 323 This condition constrains the values of the coefficients A and B in Eq. (8.90), for Eq. (8.91) can be satisfied only if B = Â±A. So we can immediately eliminate one multiplicative constant from the Hamiltonian eigenfunction, leaving { Ae\"x 7/Jn(X) = Ccoskx Ae-\"x -00 < x ~-~ -~ s x ~ ~ ~~x<oo (8.92) I dropped D from (8.92), because we don't need two coefficients (C and D) in Region 2. The piece of 7/JE(X) in this region is either a cosine function (if the state has even parity) or a sine function (if it has odd parity) . The simple reduction of Eq. (8.90) to Eq. (8.92) simplifies the ensuing algebra. Now we can determine 7/JE(X) by solving at most two simultaneous algebraic equations, rather than the four we'd have faced had we ignored parity. [The (arduous) solution of those four equations would have led us to B = Â±A anyway. But by using parity arguments, we have deduced a conclusion that we would otherwise have had to derive .] Note carefully that this simplification does not apply to a potential that is not symmetric-i-e.g., to an asymmetric square well (V3 :I VI) . This success leads us to seek additional simplifications due to symmetry. Consider the points where we must impose continuity conditions, the region boundaries Xl = -L/2 and X2 = L/2. These points are equidistant from the midpoint of the (symmetric) well, X = 0, so we can use the parity of the eigenfunction (8.92) to write { even parity odd parity . (8.93) { odd parity even parity' (8.94) So if we force 7/JE(X) and its first derivative to be continuous at one of the boundaries. then continuity at the other boundary follows automatically from Eqs. (8.93) and (8.94), and we need not impose the conditions at the second boundary. This wonderful property further reduces the number of equations we must solve! To convince yourself of the validity of this argument, examine Table 8.6, where I've imposed continuity conditions for the even-parity states at both boundaries. Notice that two sets of equations in this table are identical. Now, onward to the continuity conditions. Let 's do the odd-parity eigenfunctions (8.92). Applying Eqs. (8.93) and (8.94) to these eigenfunctions, we get a pair of simultaneous algebraic equations: C' ( 1kL) A -\"L/2sin 2 = - e Ckcos (~kL)= II':Ae\"L/2 . (8.95a) (8.95b) The unknowns in these equations are A, C, and the energy En, which is buried in the wave number and decay constant (8.96) 324 Chap.S States of a Particle in One Dimension I TABLE 8.6 CONTINUITY CONDITIONS FOR EVEN-PARITY STATES OF THE FINITE SQUARE WELL.

(8.95) we can easily derive a single equation that, when solved, will yield the quantized energies of the odd-parity states. To achieve this reduction for odd-parity states, we just eliminate the constants C and A, which are irrelevant to the energies, by dividing (8.95b) by (8.95a):33 n = 1,3,5, . .. (even-parity states) n =2, 4, 6, . . . (odd-parity states) (8.97) Question 8-25 Using the continuity conditions in Table 8.6, derive the equation in (8.97) for the even-parity states. Equations (8.97) look quite different from the energy equations we've seen hereto- fore. The reason is that the allowed values of the energy are implicit in these equations. Mathematically speaking, Eqs. (8.97) are transcendental equations. The solution of such equations requires special tools, so I'll defer this matter until the next section. In the mean- time, you can reassure yourself that they're correct by examining them in limiting cases (see Pblm. 8.11). 32There is a sound mathematical reason why we must leave the energy unspecified when we solve the TISE for bound stationary states . The normalization requirement (8.86) imposes an additional equation that the pieces 1/IE(X) must satisfy, a condition not present for a continuum state. Were we to treat the energy of the bound state as given , we would have more equations than unknowns, and could not solve Eqs. (8.95). For more on this point, see p. 103ff in Elementary Quantum Mechanics by P. Fong (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1960). 33An alternate way to solve for the bound-state energies of the finite (and infinite) square wells-a method that is based on a sophisticated use of operators (Chaps. 10 and II }-is described in the article by S. Kais and R. D. Levine, Phys. Rev. A., 34 , 4615 (1987) . Sec. 8.7 Bound States of the Finite Square Well 325 Aside: Still More Simplifications (the Logarithmic Derivative). If, as is often the case, we don't need the full fonn of 1/JE(X), but rather only the equations for the bound-state energies, we can bypass most of the algebra in this example by transforming the continuity conditions (8.40) on 1/JE(X) and its first derivative into a single condition on the logarithmic derivative. This quantity is defined as In terms of the logarithmic derivative, the continuity conditions (8.40) become the single equation You can easily derive Eqs, (8.97) by applying this equation to the even- and odd-parity eigenfunctions. The last step in the solution of the TISE for the finite square well is to determine the eigenfunction. This entails using Eqs. (8.95) and (8.96) to relate the constants A and C, viz., A= CeKL/2 cos (~kL) (even-parity states) A= _Ce KL/2 sin (~kL). (odd-parity states) (8.98) These relations reduce the eigenfunctions (8.92) to forn=1 ,3,5, ... (even parity) for n = 2,4, 5, .. . (odd parity) (8.99) One lone constant, C, remains undetermined. This is the normalization constant for these eigenfunctions, and we could determine its value by imposing the normalization condition. But, because of the complexity of the finite-well eigenfunctions, we must do so by numerical integration. Since the result adds nothing to our understanding of the physics of the stationary states of this system, I won't bother. Question 8-26 Some authors choose the zero of energy at the top of the finite square well rather than at the bottom, and let - Vo denote the well depth. What changes would this choice bring about in the definitions of the wave number and decay constant (8.96) for this problem? How-if at all-would this choice change Eqs. (8.97) for the energies and (8.99) for the spatial functions? Can you see an advantage to this choice over the one I have made in this section? 326 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I What to Do if V(x) Isn't Symmetric Nature is not always so accommodating as in this example: not all potentials are sym- metric. Suppose we're confronted with the asymmetric square well { VI V(x) = 0 V3 -00 < x ~ Xl Xl < X < X2 . X2 ~ X < 00 (8.100) (8.101) In this problem, few of the wonderful simplifications we invoked for the symmetric case apply. Since VI 0/: V3 , the decay constants in Regions I and 3 are not equal (KI 0/: K3), the eigenfunctions tPn (x) do not have definite parity, and the coefficients of tP~)(x) and tP~)(x) are not equal [A(3) 0/: B(1)l. So we know considerably less (in advance) about the eigenfunctions of the asym- metric well than we knew about those of the symmetric well. We can, however, write down the form { B(I)el<lX -00 < X s Xl tPE(X) = 0(2) COS k 2x + D(2) sin k 2x Xl ~ X ~ X2 A(3)e- 1<3X X2 ~ X < 00 To determine the coefficients in Eq. (8.101) we must apply continuity conditions at both region boundaries, Xl and X2 . Doing so is algebraically messier than the example we have walked through here, but it's valuable practice with our new problem-solving tools. If you're game, try Pblm. 8.6. 8.8 THE FINITE SQUARE WELL: THE ANSWERS We could use a number of strategies to conquer the transcendental equations for the finite square well, (8.97): graphical, iterative, and numerical (e.g., via power-series). In this section I'll sketch two of these approaches: graphical solution , which highlights important mathematical features of these equations and which is useful if you can't get at a hand calculator or a computer, and iterative solution, which is quite accurate and easily programmable.P' Rewriting the Equations To illuminate the role of the energy in the transcendental equations (8.97), let's write them in terms of the quantized values En. Actually, I want to use not En, but rather the binding energy â‚¬n . Crudely speaking, the binding energy of the nth bound stationary state measures how far En is from the top of the well. For E = 0 at the bottom of the well, the binding energy is defined as â‚¬n == VO - En. Physically, the binding energy is a measure of how \"tightly bound\" the particle is-the greater the binding energy, the deeper in the well is the energy eigenvalue. (You may know the binding energy from atomic physics, where it's often called the ionization potential.) In practical terms, the 34Although I don't advise skipping this section, you could omit one of these two methods. Graphical solution of transcendental equations is treated first; iterative solution begins with the subsection entitled \"A Transcendental Iteration.\" Sec. 8.8 The Finite Square Well: The Answers 327 binding energy is the amount of energy you would have to supply to the particle to remove it from the well (with zero kinetic energy). With this definition and Eqs. (8.96) for the wave number and decay constant, we can rewrite the transcendental equations (8.97) as n = 1,3,5, ... (even-parity states) (8.102) n =2, 4, 6, . .. (odd-parity states) Only values of En that satisfy one of these equations correspond to an eigenvalue En that yields an eigenfunction that is nonnalizable. Question 8-27 Prove from the mathematical form of Eqs. (8.102) that the only allowed values of En occur in the interval 0 ~ En ~ Vo. Discuss briefly the nature of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions for E > Voâ€¢ Reducing Clutter in the Transcendental Equations To minimize the chance that we'll make algebraic blunders while solving these equations, we should write them in terms of two intermediate quantities : a potential-strength parameter.P\" and the argument of the trigonometric functions (tangent and co-tangent), (8.103a) mL2 ,.2 _ --E .. 211.2 rr- (8.103b) With these quantities, the transcendental equations (8.102) become n = 1,3,5, . . .

That's why this quantity is called a potential strength parameter. 328 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I We'll label the roots of these equations, the values of TJ that solve them, by the index n that labels the even- and odd-parity eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian, e.g., TJn' Question 8-28 Derive Eqs.

(8.104) and the binding energies En : [ ( )2] 277\" 21i 2 En = Vo 1 -\"( = Vo - mL2 77nÂ· Transcendental Curves (8.105) Each of Eqs. (8.104) has the standard form of a transcendental equation (in the variable TJ): an equality between two functions of the variable, where at least one of the functions is a trigonometric, hyperbolic, exponential, or logarithmic function: Even-Parity Roots ft(TJ) = h(TJ) ft(TJ) = tan n h(TJ) = J(~)2 -1 Odd-Parity Roots fa(TJ) = f4(TJ) fa(TJ) = cot n f4(TJ) = -J(~)2 -1 (8.I06a) (8.I06b) (8.I06c) (8.106d) Here are some other transcendental equations you may have encountered in your studies: sin TJ = TJ, InTJ = e?\", (8.107a) (8.107b) Notice that each transcendental equation defines two curves. So the roots of such an equation are the points where these curves intersect. This way of looking at a tran- scendental equation is the key to the simplest (though least accurate) solution technique: graphical solution. Just graph each curve and look for the points of intersection. A graphical solution of the even- and odd-parity equations (8.104) for the finite square well is shown in Fig. 8.22. I've chosen the potential strength parameter ( to produce several bound states, the first five of which are circled and labeled: three of these states are even, the other two are odd. [In Example 8.8 we'll look in more detail at the solution of Eqs. (8.104); at this point I just want you to get the general idea.] Notice that the principal branches of ft (TJ) = tan TJ and fa(TJ) = cot TJ are repeated for all values of TJ. One even root comes from each branch of the tangent function: 1f 1f 1f 31f 31f 51f -2 < TJ < 2' 2 < TJ < 2 ' 2 < TJ < 2 branches of tan n (8.108a) Sec. 8.8 The Finite Square Well: The Answers 329 (a) Evenparity (b) Odd parity Figure 8.22 Graphical solution of Eqs.

A Transcendental Example Consider an electron of mass me in a bound stationary state of a hydrogen atom. Suppose the range of the Coulomb potential binding the electron is (very roughly) 1 ao. We'll model this system by a finite square well of width L = 1 ao and depth Vo = 491l'2 Ti2 j(8mL 2 ) . Like most atomic physicists, we'll solve this problem in atomic units: 37 36Actually. only part of each branch contributes a root of each parity. For example. because 12(11) is a positive function, the even-parity roots show up in the intervals 0 < 11 < 1r/2 . 1r < 11 < 31r/2. etc,-i.e., in the first and third quadrants of the unit circle. Similarly, the odd-parity roots show up in the second and fourth quadrants. 37 If you're unfamiliar with atomic units, see Appendix F. 330 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I Ii = me = ao = 1 Atomic Units. (8.109) In these units, the (dimensionless) potential strength parameter is ( = 5.498 and the depth of the well is Vo = 60.451Eh. (The atomic unit of energy is the hartree, written Eh ; 1 Eh = 27.201 eV.) This potential supports four bound states, two of even parity and two of odd parity. Graphical solution of Eqs. (8.106) yields the roots T/n shown in Table 8.7. Also shown in this table are the binding energies En and energy eigenvalues En, and the latter are compared to the bound-state energies for an infinite square well of the same width, Ei OO ) = n 27l\"2/2 Eh.

Variation of the Potential Strength Equation (8.105) shows the dependence of the binding energies f n on the depth and width of the potential well. But it may surprise you to learn that these quantities also control the number of bound stationary states that the well supports. To illustrate this point, Fig. 8.24 shows the graphical solution of the even-parity equation for three different values of the well depth Yo. As Vo (and hence () changes, the values TIn at which the curves (8.106) cross change and hence so do the eigenvalues En. From this figure, we deduce the following rule (see also Pblm. 8.2): increase well depth ==} { increase number of bound stationary states increase binding energy of each state (8.110) To illustrate this effect quantitatively, I repeated the calculations of Example 8.8 for a slightly weaker square well: instead of the values in that example, ( = Tt:/ 4 and Vo = 49rr2/8, I used ( = 4 and Vo = 32. This well supports three bound stationary states, with binding energies (in atomic units) 332 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I -- OI'----+-'---:::IlofL----+-----::oo+Â£-L---+--_ 1'/ Figure 8.24 Solution of the energy equations of the finite square well for even-parity states.

( - ( n - I) \". /2 States of a Particle in One Dimension I (8.114) Interpret this result physically: what does it imply about the effect on a particle in the well when the depth of the potential is varied according to the limit? A Transcendental Iteration Graphical solution of the transcendental energy equations for the finite square well yields a wealth of physical insights. But it is a time-consuming and not especially accurate method-at best, if you are an uncommonly good grapher, you may be able to determine IOn accurate to a couple of decimal places. To calculate more accurate binding energies, you must resort to numerical methods, such as the iterative technique to be presented here. 39 The idea behind the iterative solution of a transcendental equation is simplicity it- self: construct a series of approximate solutions, called iterates, by repeated substitution into the equation for the root. Our starting point is the generic form (8.106) for a tran- scendental equation, ft(TJ) = Jz(TJ) . To prepare such an equation for iterative solution, we rewrite it (yet again) as TJ = F(TJ) Â· (8.115) In so doing, we must carefully choose the function F(TJ) to ensure that (if possible) our series of approximate solutions converges. (I'll show you how to do this below.) For example, Eq. (8.107a) is already in the form Eq. (8.115), TJ = sin n, and Eq. (8.107b) can easily be put into this form: TJ = ee-\". Once we have chosen F(TJ), we develop a series of approximate solutions to (8.115), TJ(O) , TJ(l), TJ(2), . â€¢. according to the simple prescription in Table 8.9. We calculate the i t h iterate TJ(i) from the (i - l)th iterate by inserting the latter into the right-hand side of Eq. (8.115), viz., TJ(i) = F (TJ(i-lÂ») . (8.116) Repeating this procedure, we ultimately arrive at an approximate (but very accurate) root TJn of the transcendental equation TJ = F(TJ)-if, that is, the sequence of iterates { (0) (1) (2)} .TJ , TJ , TJ , . â€¢. converges , I.e., convergence of iterates (8.117) Aside: On Accuracy of an Iterative Solution. Assuming that your sequence does converge, the number of iterates you must calculate to attain a root of a desired accuracy (say, 12 decimal places) depends on the accuracy of your initial guess .,,(0) . So this guess should not be made in a cavalier fashion. (Indeed, whether or not your sequence of iterates converges at all may depend on how shrewd your initial guess is.) The moral is: make your initial guess an informed one: think carefully about the form of the transcendental equation you want to solve, perhaps evaluating it in one or more appropriate limiting cases to gain insight. Don't worry if you have to try several guesses to get smooth, rapid convergence (see Example 8.9). 391n this section 1 have drawn heavily on the valuable presentations by K. S. Krane, Amer. Jour. Phys. 50,521 (1982) and by R. D. Murphy and J. M. Phillips, ibid., 44, 574 (1976). See also J. P. McKelvey, Amer. Jour. Phys. 43,331 (1975), J. M. Phillips and R. D.

This book is not the place for a discourse on the convergence of iterative solutions to transcendental equations . But you need to know a bit about this topic, so you can intelligently apply this method to the transcendental equations of quantum physics. The convergence (or lack of same) of Eq. (B.ll5) depends on the first derivative of F(TJ). according to the following rule:4o the sequence (8.116) converges if I: F(TJ)! :$1. TJ l1=l1n (8.11S) This condition shows why the choice of F(TJ) is critical. For example, the iterative method will fail for the simple equation TJ = sin TJ if we write this equation as TJ = sin - 1 TJ, for this form violates Eq. (8.11S). Question 8-34 Show that of the following equivalent forms of the even-parity equation, 4Â°1\\vo types of convergence are possible: If this derivative is negative, successive iterates will oscillate about a root TJn ; if it is positive (and less than I). successive iterates will converge monotonically to a root. 336 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I 11 = cot 11.j(2 - 112 11 = tan -1 J(~r-1 (8.119a) (8.119b) (8.119c) only (8.119b) satisfies the condition (8.118).

Iterating Our Way to the Roots of the Finite Square Well To illustrate the iterative method of solution, let's consider (one last time) the finite square well of Example 8.8. This well supports Nb = 4 bound states; so we expect to find two roots of each parity (one from each quadrant of the unit circle). This knowledge guides our initial guesses for each root.41 I programmed Eqs. (8.119) on my trusty HP-25 hand calculator and obtained the roots in Table 8.10 (converged to the number of decimal points shown).

The strategy of approximating a potential near points where it varies rapidly by a discontinuous \"jump\" greatly simplifies the solution of many a TISE, and is widely used in research applications. And even if we can't invoke this approximation, we may be able to use the problem-solving techniques of this chapter. For example, a powerful method for studying continuum states of atoms, molecules, and nuclei-called the \"R-matrix method\" (see 41Unless you are using a very sophisticated hand calculator or a computer. your numerical device will probably return arctangents in the principal branch of this function. so you will have to shift each root into the appropriate branch. This is easy enough. of course : just add the appropriate multiple of 11\" [see Eqs. (8.108Â»). 42Until you work through this example yourself (which you really should do), you won't understand my choice of the initial guess for the fourth root. When I tried a point in the middle of the appropriate branch. 1)(4) = 711\"/4. I found that convergence was very slow and erratic . So I altered slightly my first guess ; the choice in Table 8.10 led speedily to the converged root. Numerical methods are like guitars: you have to fool with them a bit to get them to produce what you want. Sec. 8.9 Final Thoughts - and an Application 337 Pblm. 8. I3)-is based on partitioning space into two regions and enforcing continuity (of the logarithmic derivative) at the boundary between the regions. This method is similar in spirit to our solution of the barrier problem in Â§ 8.6. Another rather sophisticated method for dealing with continuous potentials is the \"WKB approximation.\" Like the approach used in this chapter, the WKB method entails constructing pieces of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction in CA and CF regions of the po- tential. But hooking these pieces together is rather complicated, for it requires the exact solution of the TISE at points very near the boundaries between adjacent CA and CF regions. The WKB method is particularly useful for calculating transmission coefficients through continuous barriers.P Although we've spent a lot of time implementing the problem-solving procedure in Â§ 8.4, the heart of this chapter is Â§ 8.2 (on the physics of bound and continuum states) and Â§ 8.3 and 8.5 (on the interpretation of continuum stationary states). The summaries in Tables 8.11 and 8.12 should help you to focus on the essentials of this chapter. TABLE 8.11 BOUND AND CONTINUUM STATES FOR A PIECEWISE-CONSTANT POTENTIAL.

This creature is a man-made, ultra-thin layer of crystalline matter, 43The initials stand for the last names of the inventors of this method. G. Wentzel, H. Kramers , and L. Brillouin. The WKB method straddles the nebulous line between undergraduate and graduate quantum mechanics and. with some regret, I have decided to leave it out of this book. You can read about it in most graduate and a few undergraduate texts; I particularly like the introduction in Â§ 7.10 of Introductory Quantum Mechanics by R. A. Liboff (San Francisco : Holden-Day, Inc., 1980) and, at a more advanced level, the treatment in Â§ 16.2 of Principlesof Quanrum Mechanics by R. Shankar (New York: Plenum . 1980). A clever alternative to the WKB method is the path Integral approach, which was developed by Richard Feynman and which is explicated in the text Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals by R. Feynman and A. Hibbs (New York: McGraw-Hili , 1965). To see how to apply this method to the tunnelling problem in Â§ 8.6. see B. R. Holstein and A. R. Swift, Amer. Jour. Phys.

They play an important role in the design of a variety of high-technology semiconductor devices, and you may study them someday in a solid-state physics course . One can create very accurate models of quantum-well heterostructures using sym- metric finite square wells. An example of a quantum-well heterostructure is shown in Fig. 8.26a, which shows a layer of gallium arsenide (GaAs) roughly 200 A. thick sand- wiched between two thicker layers of aluminum gallium arsenide. (For reasons that need not concern us, these are labelled AlxGal_xAs.) A bound electron in the layer of GaAs is free to move in three dimensions. And its motion in the plane of the sample, which I'B denote the yz plane, is unconstrained. So the dependence of the wave function of the electron on y and z is (to a good approximation) that of a free particle .

So the x dependence of the electron's state function is given by one of the eigenfunctions in (8.99).

Sec. 8.9 Final Thoughts - and an Application 339 So don't let anyone tell you that square wells are useful only to students of under- graduate quantum physics. ANNOTATED SELECTED READINGS Numerical Solution of the riSE In Â§ 8.8 I showed you two ways to solve transcendental equations: graphical and iterative. If the former is inaccurate and the latter doesn't converge, or if you want accurate eigenfunctions as well as the bound-state energies, you'll probably want to consider numerical solution of the TISE. This is a vast subject, full of powerful methods and lots of pitfalls. A good place to start learning about it-particularly if you have access to a personal computer-is l. Killingbeck, J. P., Microcomputer Quantum Mechanics, 2nd ed. (Boston: Adam Hilger Ltd., 1983). 2. Merrill, 1. R., Using Computers in Physics (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1976). Chap 12 of this book contains a nice discussion of applications of numerical methods to quantum physics. The clearest discussion I've read of the application of numerical methods for solving differential equations to quantum problems is Appendix G of 3. Eisberg, R., and R. Resnick, Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei , and Particles (New York: Wiley, 1985). Like almost every discussion in this admirable book, this appendix is clear and filled with examples. It even includes a computer program. Finally, you'll find a clever alternative method for calculating bound-state energies of a general piecewise-constant potential in the article by S. A. Shakir in Amer. Jour . Phys. 52,845 (1984).

I know what I have to do.\" -Nosferatu the Vampyre by Werner Herzog Exercises 8.1 Mysterious Transmissions In Â§ 8.6, we considered at length continuum states of a barrier potential for energies less than the barrier height, E < Vi). In Question 8.19, I asked you to derive Eq. (8.84) for the transmission coefficient for a state with E > Yo. This equation shows that a particle incident from the left may be transmitted past the barrier or reflected back into Region I, i.e., T(E) $ 1 and R(E) $ 1. But, as shown in Fig. 8.18a, at certain discrete energies the particle will definitely be transmitted-for at 340 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I these \"resonance energies\" T(E) = 1. Let's label the resonance energies by an index, n, as En, n = 1,2, .... We'lIlet En denote their distance from the top of the welI: En = En - Vo. [a] Derive an expression for the resonance energies En in terms of the barrier width L, the index n, and fundamental constants. [b] Let >'2 denote the de Broglie wavelength of the particle in the region [-L/2 ::; x ::; L/2J. If a transmission resonance occurs at an incident energy En, how must the barrier width L be related to the wavelength' A2 for a particle with that energy? [c] Are there transmission resonances for energies E ::; Vo? Why or why not? [d] Sketch the transmission coefficient T(E) as a function of energy for values of E from E = 0 to some value larger than the third resonance energy, E > E3 â€¢ On your sketch, show the location of Vo in relation to the resonance energies. [e] Sketch the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for the lowest-energy resonance, 'l/JE1(x). [f] In an experiment, an electron beam of current 3 nanoamperes and energy E is incident on a barrier of height Vo = 4eV. As E is increased from zero, the first observed transmission resonance occurs at E1 = 2.35 eV. Calculate the width L of the barrier, expressing your result in angstroms. 8.2 One-Dimensional Scattering in the Lab Muons are particles of charge q = -1.602 X 10- 19 C. The mass of a muon, mIL' is roughly 1/9 that of a proton. Suppose a source emits a monoenergetic beam of muons in the direction of increasing x towards a target located at x = O. In this problem, we do not know the potential energy of interaction between the target and the projectile. Indeed, alI we know is that this potential is constant in the source and detector regions. Far to the right of the target, there is a detector that measures a final current ltina). [a] In one experiment carried out using this apparatus, the energy of the muons in the incident beam is Eine = 10.0 eV and the particle density in the incident beam is 4000 muons per meter. The detector measures a current ltinal = 2.51 X 10- 11 C-sec- I â€¢ Calculate the probability that a muon in the incident beam will be reflected by its encounter with the target, expressing your result in counts per second. [b] Suppose we modify the detector so that it can also measure the kinetic energy Tllnal of the muons it detects. Repeating the experiment of part [a], we find the same final current, and the final kinetic energy of Tllnal = 6.0 eV. Write down the explicit form of the pure momentum function wp(x, t) that approximately represents the state of particles in the transmitted beam-i.e., determine the values of alI constants, such as wavenumber and frequency, that appear in this function. 8.3 Stellar Quantum Physics The energy of most stars results from the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form helium nuclei. This notion was first proposed in 1920 by Eddington and was promptly rejected by his peers on the following grounds. At temperatures typical of the interior of stars, virtually none of the hydrogen nuclei have enough kinetic energy to overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion and get close enough together to undergo a fusion reaction. But fusion does occur in stars. Explain why. 8.4 Quantum Mechanics of the Step Potential A beam of electrons of wavelength 1.5833 Ais incident from the left on the step potential { o x<O V(x) = 100eV x ~ OÂ· The flux in the incident beam is 4.5941 x 1012 electrons/sec.

Exercises and Problems 341 [b] Derive an explicit express ion for the spatialpart of the transmitted wave, i.e., for 'l/JE(X) for x > 0, again evaluating all constants . [c] From the definition of the probability current density and your answer to part [b], evaluate the transmitted current. [d] What can you conclude from your answer to part [c] concerning the value of the trans- mission coefficient at this energy? tel Evaluate the position probability density at x = 3 A. [f] Explain carefully why your answers to parts [d] and tel are not mutually contradictory. 8.5 A Step-Down Scattering Problem A beam of electrons with number density of 1 x 1015 electrons/m is incident from the left on the step potential energy { O x < 0 V(x) = -Yo x ~ 0 (The constant Vo is positive, so this is a \"down step\" rather than an \"up step\" like the potential in Fig. 8.12.) [a] Write down the form of the spatial function 'I/J<;)(x) in each region of this potential, defining all wavenumbers and/or decay constants. Don't forget to impose asymptotic conditions for x ~ Â±oo. [b] Obtain expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients for this potential, expressing your results in terms of the quantities you introduced in part [a]. (This is not hard, because you don't have to derive these expressions from scratch. Instead, try to relate this problem to one you have already solved.) [c] Evaluate T(E) and R(E) for an incident beam of kinetic energy 100eV and a step of magnitude (Yo) 50eV. Check your answer by verifying that probability is conserved [c.f., Example 8.6]. [d] Evaluate the incident and transm itted fluxes for the conditions of part [c]. Be sure to show units. tel Sketch 'l/JE(X), being careful to clearly show any differences in the nature of the spatial function or in its amplitude or wavelength between the regions. 8.6 Continuum States of the Finite Square Well A beam of particles of mass m is incident from the left on the potential well in Fig. 8.13. Suppose that the energy of the particles is greater than the height of the walls, i.e., E> Yo. [a] Write down the TISE and its general solution in each region, defining appropriate wavenumbers and arbitrary constants as needed. If you can set one or more of these arbitrary constants to zero at this point, do so and explain why. [b] Evaluate the reflected and transmitted probability current densities in each region. Be sure to indicate the direction and magnitude of each current density and label it as reflected, transmitted , etc. [c] List the conditions that you would use to relate the pieces of the function 'I/JE (x) in each region to one another . Do you have enough conditions to uniquely determine all of the arbitrary constants in these solutions? If not, discuss the physical significance of the one (or ones) you cannot determine from these conditions . [d] Define the probability of transmission into the region x ~ L/2, explaining the physical significance of this quantity and relating it to the current densities of part [c]. tel Show that the transmission coefficient is given by [ 2 ]-11 Vo . 2 T(E) = 1 + 4 E(E + Yo) sm k2L , (8.6.1) where k2 is the wavenumber in the region -L/2 :s; x :s; L/2. (This need not entail much work if you think about how this potential is related to one whose transmission 342 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I coefficient you know.) Under what conditions on k2 is T(E) = I? Consider an energy E such that this condition is satisfied. At this energy, what is the value of the reflection coefficient R(E) for this system? Why? [f] Compare the descriptions given by quantum and classical physics of the motion of a (microscopic) particle with this potential. 8.7 The Mystery of the Potential Step Here's a puzzler: Does our finding that R(E) = 1 for states of the potential step with E < Vo contradict our finding that the probability density in Region 2 for such a state is non-zero? Suppose we were to measure the position of the electron and found it, say, in an interval in Region 2 of magnitude 1/(2~2). By such a measurement, we have localized the state of the particle, i.e., we have changed its position uncertainty. Discuss the consequences of this localization for the momentum uncertainty of the projectile and for its energy uncertainty. Now, is it possible to detect an electron in the CF region with T < O? If not, why not? If so, what sense does this make? 8.8 Applying the Correspondence Principle Applying the correspondence principle to scattering problems can be tricky if you use the limit 1i -> O. But there is another way: taking the energy to extremes. Show that in the limits E ~ Vo and E Â« Vo the transmission coefficient obeys the expected classical results, i.e., T(E) ---+ 1 EÂ»Vo T(E) ---+ O. E<Vo Problems 8.1 A Review Problem on Stationary States of a Piecewise-Constant Potential Consider a particle of mass m with the potential energy (8.8.1) (8.8.2) (8.1.1)V(x) = {~ ~~: s L/2 . V2 x> L/2 Were we to set Vi = 0 and V2 = 00, this potential would reduce to an infinite square well of width L/2. But we've done that problem to death, so let's consider some other choices of these parameters. Part A: BoundStates For this part, consider only energies in the range Vi < E < V2. Moreover, suppose that the depth of the well, V2 - Vi, is great enough to support several bound states. [A.a) Suppose that V2 = 00 but Vi > O. These choices give the potential shown in Fig. 8.1.1b. Determine the stationary-state energies and eigenfunctions for this po- tential. [A.b) Suppose instead that Vi = 0 but V2 is finite and positive, i.e., consider the potential of Fig. 8.l.lc. ( I) What are the boundary conditions on the bound-state eigenfunctions of this po- tential? (2) Sketch the ground-state eigenfunction. (3) Compare the energy of the function in (2) to the energy of the corresponding eigenfunction of an infinite square welI of width L/2: i.e., is the energy of your function less than, equal to, or greater than E~oo)? Explain your answer. (4) The three lowest bound-state energies of a finite square welI of width L and depth V2 are E, = 0.98 V2 , E2 = 0.383 V2, and E3 = 0.808 V2. Now, what is the ground-state energy of potential in Fig. 8.1.1c? Explain your answer.

Evaluate the energy of the ground state of this potential. Part B: Continuum States In this part, consider only energies E> V2 in Eq. (8.1.1) for V2 > VI > o. [B.a) Write down the general solution of the TISE in each region defined by this potential. Hint : To simplify the rest of this problem, write your solutions in trigonometric rather than complex exponential form. [B.b) Apply the boundary conditions on the eigenfunction at x = o. [B.c) Write down the continuity conditions that must hold at x = L/2. Apply these condi- tions to your general solution. (But don't try to solve the resulting equations!) [B.d) Are the energies of the stationary states with E > V2 quantized? Why or why not? Are they degenerate? Why or why not? [B.e) Suppose VI = 1O.OeV and V2 = 20.0eV. Consider a continuum state of energy E = 30.0eV. (1) Evaluate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron in each region. (2) Draw a sketch of the eigenfunction for this energy. Part C: A Little Something Extra [C] The infinity in the potential (8.I.I) at x = 0 has an interesting consequence for the problem of a particle beam incident on this potential from the right with energy E. Evaluate the probability that a particle in such a beam will be reflected back into Region 3. Give a derivation or (brief) justification of your answer. Hint : Are the spatial functions for this problem travelling waves or standing waves? 8.2 How Many Bound States Are in Your Well? From the discussion in Â§ 8.8 on solution of the transcendental equations for bound-state energies of the finite square well, you can see why it's important to be able to determine in advance the number of bound states a particular potential supports. This problem explores some ways to do so. Unless otherwise stated, all questions pertain to a symmetric potential well of depth Vo and width L. [a) Have another look at the figures in Â§ 8.8. Now, explain why the following rule holds: Rule All symmetric finite square wells, however weak they may be, support at least one bound state. 344 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I Is this rule true for' an asymmetric welI, such as Eq. (8.1OO)? Why or why not? [b] Prove that the number Nb of bound states supported by V(x) is determined by the potential strength parameter ( as folIows: ==> V(x) supports Nb bound states. (8.2.1) [c] Let E~oo) denote the stationary-state energies of an infinite square welI of width L. Show that the number of bound states Nb supported by the corresponding finite well is determined by where Vo faIls on the energy spectrum of the infinite well, according to the rule (8.2.2) with the convention that E~00) = O. [d] Determine the number of even- and odd-parity bound stationary states in a well of depth Vo = 1.0 eV and width L = 1.0 A. Also determine the number of states of each parity in a weIl of depth Vo = 100 eV and width L = 10 A. [e) Consider a quantum-weIl heterostructure (Â§ 8.9) that can be modeled by a symmetric finite square weIl of depth 0.361 eV and width 180 A. How many bound states (of an electron) does this heterostructure support? 8.3 Applications of the Finite-Square Well I: Atomic Physics In the alkali atoms, the least tightly bound electron-the valence electron-experiences an attractive potential due to the nucleus and the other (so-called \"core\") electrons . The core electrons effectively screen the valence electron in such a way that its potential can (crudely) be modeled by a symmetric finite square well. For example , the diameter of the potassium atom is roughly 4.324 A. SO we might choose as the width L = 4.3 A. Consider an electron in a symmetric finite well of this width and of depth Vo = 30.0eV. [a] How many bound stationary states does this potential energy support? What is the parity of each bound Hamiltonian eigenfunction? [b] Calculate the binding energy (accurate to three decimal places) of each bound state. Express your answer in eV. [c] Graph the spatial functions for each bound state. (You need not normalize your spatial functions. But in every other respect, your graphs should be quantitatively accurate.) Sketch a typical continuum-state function-i.e., tPE(X) for some energy E > Vo. [d) For the ground state of this square well, calculate the probability for detection of a particle outside the well . Discuss the physical significance of this number. [e] Suppose a beam of photons of wavelength Ais incident on an electron in the ground state of this potential weIl. For what values of A could the incident photon be absorbed, induc- ing a transition of the electron into a higher-energy bound state or into the continuum? (Express your answer in angstroms .) Remark : In actual atoms and molecules, electrons are forbidden from making certain tran- sitions between stationary states by selection rules. These rules foIlow from the angular momentum properties of the bound stationary states of atoms. These properties are irrelevant to a one-dimensional system such as the present finite square well, but not to atoms (see Volume II). 8.4 Applications of the Finite Square Well: II (Nuclear Physics) Guided by our understanding of classical E & M, we can write the potential energy of an atom or a molecule as the sum of Coulomb (electrostatic) interaction terms between pairs of charged particles. But in nuclear physics, there is no classical analogue from which to determine the potential energy of a nucleus. So nuclear physicists must resort to model potentials constructed from experimental data, such as the observed stationary bound-state energies of nucleons. Like much of our information about the physics of nuclei, these data Exercises and Problems 345 are often determined in collision experiments. For example, we could model the potential of a nucleon in a nucleus by a symmetric finite square well . In particular, consider a neutron in the ground state of such a well. From experiments in the laboratory, we find the following information: (I) Gamma rays scattered from this nucleus can cause ejection of the neutron provided their kinetic energy is at least 8 MeV. (2) The width of the well is L = 3 fermi, How deep would a square well of this width have to be to bind a neutron by at least 8 MeV? Explain how you arrived at your answer. 8.5 Solution of the TISE by Numerical Integration For some systems, analytical solution of the TISE (using the procedure in Â§ 8.4) is not the easiest way to obtain the bound-state eigenfunctions and energies. For (many) others, analytic solution is impossible. In this problem, we explore an alternate way to solve for the eigenfunctions in such problems: numerical integration. (This method has the advantage that it is also applicable to continuous potentials, such as those we'll study in Chap. 9.) For example, suppose we have a particle of mass m with the potential energy shown in Fig. 8.5.1, ! :~:/;~~< -L/4 V(x) = Vo -L/4 s x s L/4 (8.5.1) o L/4 < x < L/2 00 x ~ L/2 Let's choose Vo = 7r2 fj,2/ 8m L2 and concentrate on the ground state . Our goals are the energy and eigenfunction of this state, E 1 and .,pI(x) . V=oo V=oo -1:.. 0 L 4 \"4 Vor---.., ____ -'-__ ~ Jl~ -1:.. 2 Figure 8.5.1 [aJ In Chap. 7 we studied the ground state of the infinite square well. We can reduce the potential in Fig. 8.5.1 to such a potential by setting Vo = O. Using your understanding of the infinite well, draw a qualitatively accurate sketch of .,pI (x) for the potential shown above. Be sure to show all important changes in wavelength, etc. On the same graph, sketch the ground-state eigenfunction for the infinite well. [b] Use numerical integration of the TISE to determine the value of E 1 â€¢ On the same figure, graph your normalized spatial function .,pI(x) and the solution of the TISE for an energy near but not equal to E I â€¢ Hint : To start, you'll need a reasonable initial guess at E lo which you can obtain by thinking about the ground-state energy for the infinite well. A reasonable step-size (l:l.x) is L/20. You must also decide where to start the integration. You know the symmetry of the ground-state eigenfunction and can deduce from this information the value of the first derivative (the slope) of .,pI (z) at x = O. So this point is a good place to initialize your integration. Then integrate to x = L/2, adjusting E 1 until .,pI (x) obeys the appropriate 346 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I boundary condition at x = LI2 (to, say, two decimal places) . You need not normalize tPI (x) ; thus you are free to pick the value of this function at the initial point equal to any convenient (real) number. [c] Alas, sometimes numerical integration is impractical or, even worse, unstable . In such predicaments, analytic solution of the differential equation may be feasible (as in the finite square well of Â§ 8.8). Solve the TISE for the potential 8.5 .1. for the ground-state energy in V(x) by analytic methods. That is, use the boundary and continuity conditions on tPE(X) to derive a transcendental equation for the energies, and then solve your equation for E I in terms of Vo by graphical or iterative method . Hint: You can make your life a little easier by using real functions wherever possible . 8.6 The Dreaded Asymmetric Square Well [a] Using the procedure of Â§ 8.4, evaluate the energies of the bound stationary states of the asymmetric square well (8.1(0) for VI = 50 eV and V3 = 30 eV. Let the width of the well be 1 A. (You will obtain a single transcendental equation for the binding energies in this well, which you can solve graphically or using the methods in Â§ 8.8.) [b] Does an asymmetric well such as the one in part [a] necessarily support one or more bound states, like the symmetric finite well? Prove your answer. 8.7 Quantum Reflection of Your Car (The Correspondence Principle) A particle incident on a symmetric finite square well (not a barrier) of depth Vo with energy greater than Vo may be reflected from the left wall of the well. Let's see what happens in a macroscopic situation . Suppose a fast-moving automobile is hurtling towards a river bank. Estimate the probability that the driver will avoid drowning because his car is repelled by quantum mechanical reflection at the river bank. (There are some circumstances where you just can't count on quantum mechanics.) 8.8 Transmission in the Limit of a Very Large Barrier Some barriers are very wide. This circumstance is a boon, for it allows us to derive a simple , physically reasonable approximation for the transmission coefficient T(E), which otherwise is given by the less-than-simple result we derived in Â§ 8.6, Eq. (8.81). (Even if your barrier isn't wide, you may want to examine its transmission and reflection coefficients in this limit. Such a study is an excellent check on your algebra.) For an energy E ::; Vo, consider the limiting case in which the barrier width L is so large that K.L Â» 1, where K. is the decay constant in the CF region. Since 11K. is the characteristic length of penetration into the CF region, this condition amounts to the reasonable requirement that L Â» 11K.. [a] Show that in this limit the transmission coefficient is given by (8.8.1) [b] What happens to T(E) in the extreme limit K.L -> oo? Why is this limit called the classicallimit? Hint: This problem is a case in point of my remark in Â§ 8.6 that manipulating complex algebraic expressions is easier if you don't work with the final result-here Eqs. (8.81) for T(E)-but rather with a well-chosen intermediate result. In this problem , you should manipulate the expression (8.73) for the ratio A(3) IA(I). Remark: Transmission in the limit of a huge barrier is sometimes described in terms of a quantity called the opacity . The opacity, which is usually denoted a, is defined (for a barrier of width L and height Vo) as a = 2mVoL2 11i,2. 8.9 Applications of Barrier Penetration Let's consider some practical applications of the results we obtained in Â§ 8.6 and in Pblm. 8.7. Suppose a beam of electrons of kinetic energy 3.8 eV is incident from the left on a square potential barrier of height 14.5 eV and width 5.3 A. Exercises and Problems 347 [a] Evaluate the probability that a particle in the beam will be transmitted through the barrier using the exact equations in Â§ 8.7, and with the approximate result you derived in the previous problem. [b] Suppose KL Â» 1. Use the result of the previous problem to show that for many values of E IVo, the order of magnitude of the transmission coefficient is given to a good approximation by (8.9.1) What does this expression give for the order of magnitude of T(E) for the physical conditions described above? Now let's change the experiment a little. Consider two experiments, one involving a beam of protons, the other a beam of deuterons. In each experiment, the source produces a beam of incident energy 7MeV that impinges on a barrier of height 10 MeV and width 10- 14 m. [c] Which beam, if either, will have a greater transmission probability? Explain your answer. [d] Verify (or contradict) your answer to [c] by evaluating T(E) for each beam. 8.10 Continuum States of a Two-Step Potential A beam of electrons with energy E is incident from the left on the \"two-step potential\" V(x) = { ~I V2 x<O O:5,x< L . x?L (8.10.1) We'll suppose that V2 > VI and will consider only continuum states with E > V2 â€¢ [a] Derive the following expression for the probability of transmission into the region x > L: (8.10.2) Graph T(E) versus E for a range of energies E > V2. [b] Although I've given you the answer to [a], don't just believe it. Show that (8.10.2) reduces to the correct transmission coefficients for the special cases VI = V2 and V2 = O. [c] Let's consider this problem from a slightly different point of view. Suppose E is fixed but we can vary the width of the first step, L. Determine an expression for the value of L that will maximize the transmission coefficient T(E), writing your answer in terms of the de Broglie wavelength in the region 0 :5, x :5, L. [d] In part [b] we saw that the transmission coefficient for the double step reduces to that of the single step if VI = V2 â€¢ But how is it related to the coefficients for the two-step potentials that make up the double-step in Fig. 8.10.1? Let TI (E) denote the transmission coefficient for a single step at x = 0 and T2(E) the coefficient for a single step at x = L. Write down expressions for TI (E) and for T2 (E) and show that each is greater than or equal to T(E) of part [a]. [e] Use your answer to [d] to demonstrate that T(E) =I T I (E)T2(E) . But wait! Is this correct? Consider the following argument: \"The probability current density transmitted past the step at x = 0 is T I (E)jin c. This current is incident on the step at x = L . Therefore the current density transmitted into the region x > L is T2(E)TI (E)jin c, and we conclude that T(E) = T2(E)TI(E) .\" Somewhere in this argument there lurks an incorrect assumption. What is it? 348 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I V(x) o L x Figure 8.10.1 Two-step potential. 8.11 Square Wells: Going to Extremes Having gone through the not-inconsiderable algebra required to determine the transcendental equations (8.97) for the bound-state energies and Eqs. (8.99) for the Hamiltonian eigenfunc- tions of the finite square well, how can we convince ourselves that our answers are correct? Well, one way to do so is to consider a limiting case for which we know the correct an- swer. For the finite square well, the obvious limit is that in which the well becomes infinite, Vo -+ 00 . Show that in this limit, the finite square well energies and spatial functions reduce to Eqs. (7.49) and (7.55) for the infinite square well. (In considering the spatial funct'ons, you need show only that their dependence on x reverts to that of the infinite square well spatial functions; don't worry about the normalization factor.) 8.12 A Nifty Problem-Solving Trick You can solve lots of problems in quantum mechanics (and, for that matter, in most other fields of science and engineering) by analogy to problems that you have already worked. The key to mastering this powerful tactic is to think carefullyabout how the problemyou are trying to solve differs physicallyfrom problems whose solutions you know. For example, in some applications to solid state physics, the potential energy of an electron can be modeled rather accurately by the \"semi-infinite\" potential in Fig. 8.12.1, V(xr /. V=ao V(x) = { : Vo x:S;O O<x<L. x~L (8.12.1) o L Figure 8.12.1 A \"semi-infinite\" square x well. [a) Suppose the well parameters Vo and L are such that this potential energy supports three bound stationary states. Sketch the spatial functions of these states. Hint: What are the boundary conditions on tPE(X) at x = 0 and in the limit x -+ oo? [b) What is the (transcendental) equation for the bound-state energies of the semi-infinite well? Answer this question in two ways: 1) by solving the TISE, imposing appropriate boundary and continuity conditions; 2) by writing down the answer from a consideration of the corresponding finite square well. Which way was easier? 8.13 The R-matrix Method In research, it's often very difficult to solve for the Hamiltonian eigenfunction of an atomic, molecular, or nuclear system, because we do not know the potential (e.g., in nuclear physics) Exercises and Problems 349 or because the TISE poses insuperable computational problems (e.g., in atomic and molecular physics). One widely-used stratagem for conquering such problems is the RÂ·matrix method. This method exploits the remarkable fact that you don't need to know the detailed structure of the eigenfunction in the region of the potential provided you can somehow evaluate this function (and its first derivative) at the \"potential boundary\"-the point in space beyond which the potential is (effectively) zero. To illustrate the R-matrix method, consider a very simple application: a symmetric, piecewise-constant one-dimensional potential. [a) A beam of particles of energy E and unit amplitude is incident from the left on a symmetric potential V(x) . The potential is known to be zero except in the region -L/2 ~ x ~ L/2, but it is not necessarily piecewise-constant. All we know about it inside this region is that it is well-behaved (e.g., continuous). Show that the probability amplitudes for reflection and transmission, p(E) and r(E), can be written in terms of the logarithmic derivative at x = +L/2, (8.13.1) [Notice that I have redefined this quantity (see Â§ 8.7) by multiplying by L/2, so as to produce a conveniently dimensionless quantity.] [b) Derive expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients R(E) and T(E) in terms of .cE( ~). [c] Now let's apply the result of part [a) to the barrier potential in Fig. 8.17, V(x) = { ~ x < -L/2 -L/2 ~ x ~ L/2 . x> L/2 (8.13.2) Show that for states with E > Vo, your results of part [a] reduce to Eqs. (8.81) for T(E) and to the corresponding result for R(E). Hint: Since V(x) is symmetric, there exist two (degenerate) eigenfunctions for each energy; these can be chosen so that each has definite parity. You can reduce the amount of algebra in this problem by defining a logarithmic derivative for each of these functions, say .c<;:) (~) for the even function and .c~-)(~) for the odd function. Youcan then derive rather simple expressions for p(E) and r(E) in terms of these logarithmic derivatives. Remark : In one dimension, the \"R-matrix\" that gives this method its name is the inverse of the logarithmic derivative. In applications of this method, it turns out that it is more convenient (computationally) to use this quantity rather than .c[1/JE(XÂ»). 8.14 Resonances in One-Dimensional Potential Wells One of the most tantalizing phenomena in physics is the resonance . Resonances are a phe- nomenon of scattering, and we can illustrate their basic physics in the context of a (slightly artificial) one-dimensional potential. (Actually, the creature we are studying is called a virtual state, because it occurs in a state with zero angular momentum; but such technicalities need not concern us. See, however, the following problem.) Consider a particle of mass m with a \"soft\" square well potential, i.e., a semi-infinite square well with a delta-function potential for positive x : { (X) x<O V(x) = . o:o(x-L) x>O (8.14.1) The constant 0: is called the opacity of the (repulsive) delta function potential, which is centered at x = L. We shall assume that 0: Â» 1, i.e., the barrier is highly opaque. [a] Consider a continuum state of energy E = h, 2 k2 / 2m > O. Show that in the region out- side the well the Hamiltonian eigenfunction for this state (normalized according to Dirac 350 Chap. 8 States of a Particle in One Dimension I Delta function normalization, as in Chap . 4) can be written in terms of the wavenumber k and a function of k that we'll denote {3(k) as 1/JE(X) = sin (kx + {3(k)). (x > L) (8.14.2) As you may have guessed, {3(k) is the phase of the eigenfunction outside the \"soft box.\" What is the form of 1/JE(X) inside the well (0 < x < L)? [b] Derive expressions for the phase {3(k) and the amplitude A(k) of the eigenfunction inside the well. Hint: Your expressions for {3(k) and A(k) should be written in terms of k, L, and o . You will find the subsequent parts of this problem to be easier if you first transform your results from part [b] into expressions for tan {3(k) and for A(k) in terms of cos 2kL and sin2kL. [c] Derive expressions for {3(k) and A(k) in the limit of an infinitely opaque barrier (0 -+ 00) and thereby show that except for certain special values of k there is no penetration into the well ti.e., the Hamiltonian eigenfunction inside the well is zero). In this limit, what are the energies corresponding to the special values of k for which penetration does occur? These special energies are the resonance energies, and the penetration phenomenon you have exhibited here is characteristic of scattering at a resonance energy . [d] Analysis of the amplitude (which you need not carry out) reveals that for a finite but very large opacity (0)> 1), the amplitude A(k) attains its maximum for values of k that satisfy the transcendental equation 2k tan 2kL = - / 2 ' 2mo 1i (8.14.3) Like the transcendental equations we solved in Â§ 8.8, this equation is satisfied only for a discrete set of wavenumbers. We'll label these roots k n ; n = 1,2 , . . . . Derive expressions for the amplitude of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction inside the well at one of these \"resonant wavenumbers\" [A(kn )] and show that for even n, these amplitudes are huge [A(k n ) Â» 1], while for odd n they are very small [A(k n ) Â« 1]. For 0 Â» 1, where are the resonance energies in proximity to those of part (c)? tel To get a feeling for the extraordinary effect of a resonance on the eigenfunction (and hence on the position probability density) , consider a specific case : (8.14.4) Graph A(k) and f3(k) for values of k in the range ~; ::; k ::; ;1;. You will find that there is one resonance in this range; discuss the effect of this resonance on A(k) and on f3(k) for k in this range. What happens to the resonance energy and wavenumber as 0-+ oo? 8.15 More About Virtual States (in One Dimension) In this problem , we'll look at virtual states from a different point of view than that adopted in Pblm. 8.13. Note: This problem does not require that you have completed Pblm. 8.13. Consider the potential energy 1 0 Vo V(x) = 0 Vo o x < -L/2 - b -L/2 - b ::; x::; -L/2 -L/2 < x < L/2 L/2 s x s L/2 + b x> L/2+b (8.15.1) Exercises and Problems 351 V(x) Vo f- -b o b x Figure 8.15.1 A piecewise-constant potential that supports a virtual state. This potential consists of two barriers, each of height Vo and equal width b, separated by a distance L (see Fig. 8.15.1). It is a repulsive potential that does not support any bound stationary states. [aJ Discuss qualitatively and quantitatively the stationary states of a particle with this poten- tial energy. Consider two cases: E ~ Vo and E $ Vo. Show that in the energy range o $ E $ Vo there exist discrete values of the energy En such that an eigenfunction with energy near En has a much larger amplitude in the region between the barriers (i .e., for -L/2 $ x $ L/2) than anywhere else in space. At any time to, we can construct a wave packet that is highly localized in the region between the barriers by superposing a number of (continuum) stationary-state wave functions III E (x , to) with energies in a narrow range D.En about one of these \"special energies\" En. As time passes (i.e., for t ~ to), the packet \"leaks out\" of the region between the wells. A quantum state represented by such a function is called a virtual state of energy En and energy uncertainty D.E\". [bJ Let D.tn denote the time it takes the packet to \"leak out\" of the region between the barriers. Show that for a virtual state of energy En, the product D.En D.tn is a number of the order of Planck's constant. [cJ Consider the limit in which the width of the barriers becomes infinite: b -+ 00 with the condition that the width L of the well between the barriers is constant. Show that in this limit, the energies En of the virtual states of part [aJ approach the bound-state energies of a finite square well of width L and depth Vo.

H. Malden In Chap. 8 we learned how to solve the TISE for bound and continuum stationary-state eigenfunctions of one-dimensional potentials that could be approximated by piecewise- constant functions. But most potentials are not amenable to so simple a model, for their variation with x is more complicated than a finite number of abrupt changes. Here, for example, are several such potentials, each of which plays an important role in a discipline of current research.' (9.lc) (9.1d) (9.10) (9.1b) Poschl-Teller potential hole harmonic oscillator Morse potential linear potential V(x) = ~mw5x2 V(x) = ax V(x) = D [1- e-a(X-xe)f VoV(x)=-- cos2 ax [In Eqs. (9.1), everything that isn't x or a number is a parameter.] We cannot obtain eigenfunctions of Hamiltonians with these potentials using the machinery of Chap. 8, because their continuous nature prohibits us from subdividing space (-00 < x < 00) into a (finite) number of regions within which V(x) is constant. Of course, the mathematical and physical principles of Chap. 8-boundary, asymptotic, and continuity conditions- do apply to these systems. But we need new mathematical tools for solving the TISE. Most continuous potentials support both bound and unbound states. The eigen- functions for unbound states-the continuum stationary-state functions-are not nor- malizable. But we can interpret them physically (as scattering probability amplitudes) because they remain finite in the asymptotic region; i.e., for any E in the continuum, these eigenfunctions obey [ej., Eq. (8.8)] I ItPE(X) I < 00 Continuum state I (9.20) The eigenfunctions for bound states are normalizable-and hence physically admissible- only for certain discrete energies.

In this chapter you'll see how to solve the TISE for the harmonic oscillator (Â§ 9.7) and the linear potential (Â§ 9.11). For a discussion of the Poschl-Teller potential hole, see G. Poschl and E. Teller, Z. Physik, 83. 143 (1933). 354 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II Strategies for obtaining continuum eigenfunctions of continuous potentials differ only in detail from those for the piecewise-constant potentials of Chap. 8. So in this chapter, I won't dwell on continuum states; rather, I'll show you how to obtain bound- state solutions of the T1SEfor a continuous potential . Many and varied are the methods for doing so, and an in-depth look at several of them would take us far from the essentials of quantum physics. So I'll concentrate on a single, very powerful, widely applicable technique : the method of power-series expansion (Â§ 9.7). But one does not always need a quantitative solution of the TISE . If all we need is a rough idea of the nature of the eigenfunctions and the energies, we can use qualitative arguments such as those in Chap. 8. So we'll begin (in Â§ 9.2) by generalizing these arguments from Chap. 8 and by learning a few new tricks. In subsequent sections we'll augment our qualitative understanding with quantitative results for selected systems. So much effort goes into solving the TISE for these systems that it's easy to forget that stationary states are only a small, special subset of the quantum states of the system. So, for the principal example of this chapter (the simple harmonic oscillator), I'll supplement our study of stationary states in Â§ 9.6-9.9 with a look at a non-stationary state (Â§ 9.10). But first we must return to our scheme for analyzing stationary states according to regions defined by the potential and see what, if anything, of this procedure can be salvaged when the potential is continuous. 9.1 REGIONS, REGIONS EVERYWHERE Identifying regions of piecewise-constant potential (Chap. 8) was trivial : we defined each region by the appropriate constant value of the potential, Vq , irrespective of the state we were considering. For a state of energy E, we then classified each region as classically-allowed (CA) or classically-forbidden (CF), accordingly as E < Vq or E~ Vq â€¢ The difficulty posed by continuous potentials, such as those in Fig. 9.1, is that a continuous potential does not unig,..uely demarcate regions of space. Consider, for example, the three states indicated by horizontal lines in Fig. 9.1a. Two of these are continuum states; the other is a bound state. For the continuum state with the highest energy, all of space is classically allowed, because E ~ V(x) for all x. But for the other continuum state, the region under the barrier is classically forbidden . And for the bound state, only the region in the well is classically allowed . Clearly, to define the regions of a continuous potential we must take into account the energy of the state we want to investigate. Yet, the classification scheme of Chap . 8 still applies: E ~ V(x) E < V(x) classically allowed classically forbidden Since the regions of a continuous potential depend on the energy of the state, so do the locations of the boundaries between regions . Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 9.1b, the boundaries for two bound states of an attractive well occur at different values of x . Borrowing from classical physics, quantum mechanics call each boundary between a CA and a CF region a classical turning point. The classical turning points are the values of x at which the total energy of a particle equals its potential energy . (A macroscopic Sec. 9.1 Regions, Regions Everywhere 355 V(x) 1--------------- Continuum state 1----1--\\--------- Continuum state x Bound I----------'l~---~r-- state (a) V(x) Â£2 1-------\\--;-------7\"-7'--- Â£, t------~------#---- (bl x Figure 9.1 Two continuous potentials. (a) A finite-range potential with both a barrier and a well. Such a potential supports bound and continuum states. with different regions. (b) The regions and classical turning points of a continuous potential well depend on the energy E of its states, as indicated by the horizontal lines. particle moving through a classically-allowed region will tum around when it reaches a position where its potential energy equals its total energy, because the kinetic energy of such a particle can't be negative.) To emphasize the dependence of these points on the energy, I'll denote the classical turning point between region q and region q + 1 by the slightly ornate symbol x(q) (E). So, by definition, V(x(q) (E)) = E [at a classical turning point]. (9.4) Having identified and classified the regions of V (x) for a state, we can sketch the Hamiltonian eigenfunction. We prepare such drawings just as in Chap. 8: we consider each region separately, then join the pieces of the eigenfunction at the classical turning points in such a way that the eigenfunction and its first derivative are continuous every- where. But when we try to implement this approach quantitatively, to solve the TISE as we did for a piecewise-constant potential in Â§ 8.4, we run into big trouble. What the Hamiltonian Eigenfunction In a Region Is Not The potential in the TISE is the troublemaker. In the qth region, this equation is d~21/J~)(X)= - ~~[E,- V(x)]1/J~)(x). X(q-l) (E) :5 x :5 x(q) (E) . (9.5) Look carefully at the right-hand side. It does not have the simple form of a constant times the unknown function ref, Eq. (8.22) and Eq. (8.29)]. So we cannot simply write down an analytic form for the solution in each region. Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II Equation (9.5) is an ordinary differential equation of the form d 2 dx2'ljJE(X) = (function of x) 'ljJE(X). (9.6) So its solution, 'ljJ~)(x),is not a simple sum of sine and cosine functions in a CA region or of real exponentials 'in a CF region. Consequently, trying to work out this solution via a region-by-region analysis probably won't work. Instead, we must tackle the full TISE, - 00 < x < 00. (9.7) To reinforce this point, ponder for a moment the ground-state eigenfunction of a simple harmonic oscillator [the potential (9.la)] shown in Figure 9.2. As we'll discover in Â§ 9.7, this eigenfunction, which for technical reasons is labelled with the index n == 0, is 'ljJo(X) = (\";,,~or/4e-mwox2/2h . (9.8) The dependence on x of this function differs strikingly from that of an eigenfunction for a piecewise-constant potential: nowhere does 'ljJo(x) have the simple trigonometric or exponential dependence of the eigenfunctions of Chap. 8. So don't forget that Rule The Hamiltonian eigenfunctions for a continuous potential are not made up of pieces each of which can be written as a sum of simple trigonometric or exponential functions . Instead. the functions must be obtained by solving the full TlSE, Eq. (9.7). Before tackling the quantitative solution of this equation, I want to show you how to deduce the qualitative nature of'ljJE(x). Get ready to cast your mind back to high school algebra, for it is there that we shall find the key. x Figure 9.2 The ground-state eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator (9.1a). The classical turning points are labelled x(1) (En) and x(2) (En). Sec. 9.1 Regions, Regions Everywhere 357 9.2 CURVATUREIS THE KEY You probably learned about the curvature of simple functions in your high school mathe- matics course. But you don't have to dig through a math book to-see curvature. Curvature is the difference between a gently rolling hill and a precipitous mountain, between a nar- row ravine and a wide valley. In math or in nature, the curvature of a function is a measure of the rate of change of the function's slope. The first derivative of a function is its slope, so the second derivative is its curvature. This quantity tells us \"how rapidly the function turns over.\" (When I talk about \"rapid\" or \"slow\" variation of a function, I don 't mean to imply variation in time. This colloquial usage refers to the variation of the function with z .) A glance at the Schrodinger equation (9.7) will reveal why curvature is so im- portant in the quantum mechanics of stationary states: the curvature of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction is d?r/JE(X)jdx2. In this section, we'll discover what curvature can tell us about the nature of these eigenfunctions and their energies. In Chap. 8, we learned how to stitch together spatial functions for systems with piecewise-constant potentials from oscillatory and exponential pieces. The nature of each piece-oscillatory or exponential-depended on whether its region was classically allowed or classically forbidden. More generally , what determines the nature of any function f(x) is the sign of the curvature of the function . Examples of two types of functions are shown in Fig. 9.3. The function f(x) in Fig. 9.3 is oscillatory; such a function is often said to be concave. The second derivative d2f(x)jdx2 is negative where f(x) is positive, and ~f(x)jdx2 is positive where the function is negative. So the identifying feature of an oscillatory (concave) function is 1 d2f f(x) dx2 < 0 =} f(x) is oscillatory (concave). (9.9a) By contrast, the function g(x) in Fig. 9.3 varies monotonically with x ; functions with this behavior are said to be convex. The sign of the second derivative of this function is identical to the sign of the function itself, so the identifying feature of a monotonic (convex) function is 1 ~f f(x) dx2 > 0 f(x) is monotonic (convex) (9.9b) The simplest oscillatory and monotonic functions are, respectively, the trigono- metric and (real) exponential functions of Table 8.3 (cf., Tables 8.11 and 8.12). But these functions do not solve the TISE for a continuous potential, so only their qualitative nature is relevant here. Curvature and the Hamiltonian Eigenfunction The simplest deduction we can make from the curvature of an eigenfunction is whether it is oscillatory or monotonic . The form of the TISE (9.7) illuminates this feature of the eigenfunctions: d2 2m dx21/JE(X) = -r;: [E - V(x)] 1/JE(X) ~ 2m ] d 21/JE(X) = +2'\" [V(x) - E 1/JE(X) X 1i rCA Region] [CF Region] (9. lOa) (9. lOb) 358 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II fIx) g(x) x d 2 f >0 dx 2 Concave d 2g > 0 dx 2 x d 2 -2 g(X) = + ,,2 (X)g(X) dx Convex Figure 9.3 Examples of a concave and a convex function. Clearly, the TISE determines the nature of the eigenfunction in each region defined by V(x) and E. The curvature of an eigenfunction at a point x depends on the energy E, on the value of z, and, of course, on the functional dependence of 'l/JE(X) on x.2 In particular, the sign of the curvature of 'l/JE(x)-and hence the nature of this eigenfunction-is determined by the sign of E - V(x) . In a CA region, the energy is greater than V(x); so Eq. (9.9a) applies and the eigenfunction is oscillatory. The reverse argument pertains to a CF region, and we conclude\" E ~ V(x) E < V(x) (CA region) (CF region) 'l/JE (x) is oscillatory 'l/JE(X) is monotonic (9.lOc) But the nature of an eigenfunction is only a small part of what we can learn from its curvature . We can use the relationship between curvature and the energy to draw accurate sketches of eigenfunctions even for very complicated potentials. To introduce this topic, I want to compare qualitatively two eigenfunctions of the (not-very-complicated) potential in Fig. 9.4a. Superimposed on this potential are the energies of its first and second excited states. The corresponding eigenfunctions, 'l/J2(X) and 'l/J3(X), are shown in Figs. 9.4b and 9.4c. Question 9-1 Explain why neither of the functions in Fig. 9.4 is the ground-state eigenfunction of the potential in Fig. 9.4a. Sketch the missing function. Let's first deduce the shape of these eigenfunctions in the 'CA region. Since E3 - V(x) > E2 - V(x), the curvature of 'l/J3(X) is greater than that of'l/J2(x). Hence the de Broglie wavelength of 'l/J3(X) is smaller than that of 'l/J2(X) (i.e., A3 < A2). (Notice 2Equations (9.10) show that the curvature of tPE(X) depends on x , For this reason. d2tPE/dx2 should (strictly speaking) be called the \"local curvature\" of the eigenfunction . 3These arguments are consistent with our findings for a piecewise-constant potential. In this simple case E - V(x) = E - Vq. The pieces of tPE(X) in a CA region are the simplest oscillatory functions. sin kqx and cos kqx .

Now let's tum to the CF regions (outside the well), Here V(x) - E 3 < V(x) - E 2 , so the curvature of 1/J3(x) is less than that of 1/Jz(x). In these regions, both of these functions decay monotonically to zero, but the differences in their curvatures means that 1/J3(X) decays to zero more slowly (with increasing distance from the midpoint of the well) than does 1/Jz(x). That is, 1/J3(X) penetrates deeper into the CF regions than does 1/Jz(x). (If we pick E = a at the bottom of the well, as in Fig. 9.4a, we can translate this argument into a simple principle: the function with the larger energy is the most penetrating.) Mathematically, this difference appears in the decay constants for these functions, K.z > K.3' and in the characteristic lengths, 1/K.3 > 1/K.z. Aside: Another Look at the Finite Square Well. These arguments explain differ- ences between the various bound-state eigenfunctions of the symmetric square well of Â§ 8.8 (c f. , Fig. 8.23). Compare, for example, 1/Jl(X) and 1/J2(X). The curvature of the latter function is roughly four times that of the former (because E2 is roughly four times Ed. Correspondingly, the de Broglie wavelength of 1/J2(X) is about half that of 1/Jl (x) . These arguments are also reflected in the data in Tables 8.7 and 8.8. Consider, for example, the CF regions of the finite square well. As the quantum number n (and hence the energy En) increases, the decay constant Kn decreases, and 1/Jn(X) penetrates more deeply into the CF region. 360 / Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II The continuous potential in Fig. 9.4 looks rather like a \"smoothed out\" square well. And, indeed, the primary difference between the behavior of the eigenfunc- tions of this potential and those of the finite square well is that the pieces of the spatial functions for the continuous well are not simple trigonometric or exponential functions. Rather, they are complicated oscillatory or monotonic functions. To summarize this discussion of contrasting eigenfunctions, I'll re-state our conclu- sions in terms of the binding energy (n (Â§ 8.8) . The binding energy of a particle in a well is just the energy measured from the top of the well; e.g., for the potential in Fig. 9.4a, (n == Vo - En. So, for example, the less tightly bound of two bound states is the one with the smaller binding energy. We have argued that Rule A weakly bound state oscillates more rapidly in a CA region and penetrates more deeply into a CF region than a tightly bound state. The \"Local Wavelength\" and OtherQuantities You may have noticed that in discussing the eigenfunctions in Fig. 9.4, I used the \"wavelengths\" and \"decay constants\" of these functions. Because the potential is a continuous function of x , these quantities are not constants. Still, this usage enables us to exploit analogies between the Schrodinger Equations for continuous and piecewise- constant potentials. To acknowledge the x dependence of these quantities, we refer to them as \" local\" : (9.11c) (9.11b) (9.11a) local wavelength local wave number local decay constant k(x) == J~[E - V(x)] K(X) == J~\":[V(x) - E] 211\" A(X) == k(x) ' You may find it useful to write the TISE in CA and CF regions in terms of these quantities, viz., CA Region '(9.12a) CA region d 2 dX21/JE(X) = +K 2 (X)1/JE(X) CF Region. (9. 12b) [Compare these equations to Eqs .

In Chaps. 7 and 8, we uncovered an- other intimate relationship, that between the allowed (quantized) values of these energies and the boundary conditions the corresponding eigenfunctions must satisfy . Indeed, in the solutions of the TISE for the infinite and finite square wells, quantization of the bound- state energies emerged as an inevitable consequence of these boundary conditions. We can use the connection between quantized energies, the curvature of eigenfunctions, and the boundary conditions on these functions to understand more deeply the phenomenon of quantization in quantum physics. Recall the infinite square well (Â§ 7.4). This potential defines only one region where tPE(X) is non-zero: within the walls. The spatial functions must equal zero at the walls, and this boundary condition restricts the allowed energies to En = n 2 1l\"21i?/ (2mL2) for n = 1,2,3, ... . This restriction, in tum, constrains the wavelengths of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions in this (CA) region to the discrete values>. = 2L, L, 2L/3, L/2, .. . . And this constraint controls the allowed curvatures of the eigenfunction. A solution of the TISE whose curvature differs even slightly from one of the allowed values will not satisfy the boundary condition at the walls of the box and hence is inadmissible . The principles at work in this trifling example are our guides to understanding the interplay of curvature and quantization in far more complicated systems. Now consider a finite potential, such as the finite square well or the potential in Fig. 9.4a. Each bound-state eigenfunction of such a potential encompasses several regions. We must impose boundary conditions in the first and last (classically forbidden) regions, where the function must monotonically decay to zero. The rate of this decay is controlled by the local decay constant K(x)-which, by its definition (9.llb), is related to the (quantized) energy of the state and which, through the TISE (9.12b), is related to the curvature of the function. So if the energy and curvature aren't just right, the eigenfunction won't decay-it will blow up. Between the first and last regions are one or more intermediate regions. The pieces of tPE(X) in these regions must hook together so that the composite spatial function is continuous and smoothly varying everywhere. But, because the pieces in the intermediate regions are determined by the values of tPE(X) and its first derivative at the boundaries of the first and last regions (see Â§ 9.3), the role of the intermediate regions in quantization is secondary to that of the outer regions. To illustrate the relationship of quantization, curvature, and energy, let's return to the generic continuous potential in Fig. 9.4a and take another look at the eigenfunction for the second excited state. If we imagine ourselves travelling in from Â±oo, where tP3(X) = 0, we can see that the value of the local decay constant K(X), which controls the decay of this function to zero in the limit x - Â±oo, determines the value of this function and its slope at the classical turning points. As we cross these points, we must ensure that the pieces in the CF regions we're leaving join continuously and smoothly to the piece in the CA region inside the well. For all these conditions to be met, the energy must be just right, E = E 3 â€¢ To see what can go wrong, let's change the energy just a bit-increasing it, say, to E~ > E3 (see Fig. 9.5a)-and solve the TISE anew. The resulting solution, which is sketched in Fig. 9.5a, and its first derivative are suitably continuous at the classical turning points. But in the CF regions, this function does not decay to zero; instead, it blows up as x - Â±oo. 362 .Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II V(x) --'llr----+--+--E~ l/I(x) x V(x) -+--t------J'---- E~' x (a) x (bl x Figure 9.5 Naughty eigenfunctions: solutions of the TISE (for the potential of Fig. 9.4a) that cannot represent physically admissible bound states. The eigenfunctions shown are those for an eigenvalue slightly (a) larger and (b) smaller than E3. (Adapted from Introduction to Quantum Physics by R. H. Dicke and 1. P. Wittke (Reading. Mass.: Addison-Wesley. 1960).] An equally impressive cataclysm occurs if we decrease the energy slightly, say to Eft < E 3 in Fig. 9.5b. Again, the monotonic pieces of the solution for Eft in the CF regions blow up in the asymptotic limits. In either case, these exploding functions are perfectly legitimate mathematical solutions of the TISE; but they're useless to us, for they cannot be interpreted as a probability amplitude. The interplay of curvature, boundary conditions, and energy quantization that we have explored in one-dimensional systems characterizes all quantum systems that support bound states. We've seen that Rule A physically admissible bound-state eigenfunction of a continuous potential must decay to zero in two CF regions: one that includes x -+ 00 and one that includes x -+ -00. The monotonic pieces of this function must connect to pieces in the intermediate region(s) so as to preserve the continuity of the function and its first derivative. These inviolable demands quantize the energy of the particle and constrain the curvature of the wave function that represents its state. Sec. 9.2 Curvature Is the Key 363 9.3 THE STATIONARY STATES OFAN ARBITRARY POTENTIAL 'My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,' said he, with a touch of impatience. -from The Sign of Four by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle In Â§ 9.2, we saw how to use the interplay of boundary conditions, energy quanti- zation, and curvature to understand the shape of bound-state eigenfunctions of the finite square well, the harmonic oscillator, and a generic symmetric potential (Fig. 9.4a). Here I want to explore features of the collection of Hamiltonian eigenfunctions of a one- dimensional system; these features are invaluable guides to understanding the qualitative nature of these important functions. A somewhat more complicated potential is the \"bistable\" (double-dip) potential in Fig. 9.6a. The spatial functions for the three lowest stationary states of this potential are graphed in Fig. 9.6b. The behavior of each of these functions-their oscillations in the CA region, numerous nodes, and decay in the CF regions-is explicable in terms of the principles of Â§ 9.2.4 Consider, for example, the ground-state function tPo(x). This function corresponds to the minimum allowed energy, so in the CA region it has the smallest curvature and no nodes . The local decay constant of the ground state is larger than that of any other stationary state, so in CF regions its tPo(x) decays to zero more rapidly than any other bound-state eigenfunction. Similar arguments explain the excited-state eigenfunctions. The energy of the first of these states, E .. is greater than that of the ground state, Eo. The corresponding eigenfunction is the normalizable solution tPE(X) of the TISE for the value of E nearest to (but greater than) Eo. Because E 1 > Eo, the local wavelength in the CA region of tPl(X) is less than that of tPo(x), and tPl(X) has one more node than tPo(x). Can you see how to extend these arguments to the eigenfunction for the second excited state? Nodes Physically, the nodes of a wave function correspond to minima in the position probability density (c/., Fig. 8.23). In qualitative problem solving, the number of nodes of an eigenfunction is an important clue to its shape. And in quantitat ive problem solving, the number of nodes is a vital check on a numerical or analytic solution of the TISE. Here's a handy summary of our deductions thus far concerning the nodal structure of the bound-state eigenfunctions (of a one-dimensional system): number of nodes in tPn(x) (if n = 1 labels the ground state) = n - 1 (9.13) 4This potential, which is the sum of two hyperbolic cosine functions, is one of an interesting class of bistable potentials. One can solve the TISE of a particle in a bistable potential for low-lying bound states by analytic means. The strategy used to solve the particular bistable potential in Fig. 9.6 is the method of power series (see Â§ 9.7). For the details, see M. Razavy, Amer. Jour. Phys. 48,285 (1980). Notice, by the way, that the ground state is labelled by n = 0, not n = 1. 364 Chap . 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II vex) 6 4 2 0 0.5 x -2 -4 -6 (a) \"'.(x) 0.4 x (b) Figure 9.6 (a) The bistable potential V(x) = h 2 (cosh 4x - 6 cosh 2x - 1) [m and (b) its three lowest bound-state eigenfunctions.

Phys. 48, 285 (1980); used with permission.] Unlike some of our other tools (e.g., parity arguments), the nodal characteristics of bound-state eigenfunctions don't depend on the symmetry of the potential. To illustrate this point, let's consider a state of a simple, asymmetric, piecewise-constant potential. Example 9.1. Deducing an Eigenfunction of the Asymmetric Square Well At the end of Â§ 8.7, I discussed briefly the asymmetric square well (see also Pblm. 8.6). Let's work out some of the qualitative properties of the eigenfunction for the first excited state of the potential (see Fig. 9.7) { 5 x < 0 V(x) = 0 0::; x::; 4. 2 x> 4 (9.14) Note carefully that I've written this potential in atomic units (see Example 8.8 and Ap- pendix F). Notice also that since V(x) is piecewise constant, the pieces of'l/Jl(x) consist of the simple sine. cosine, and real exponential functions of Table 8./2 {see Eq. (8./OI)j. The potential (9.14) supports two bound states. Numerical solution of the TISE for this potential reveals that the energy of the first excited state is E 2 = 1 E\" .

In Example 9.1, we consider the first excited state of this potential for well parameters VI = 5 Eh, V3 = 2 e; and L = 4 ao. (b) A sketch of the eigenfunction for the first excited state of this potential; also shown is the corresponding eigenfunction for an infinite square well of the same width. we can calculate the wavelength in the CA region and the decay constants in the CF regions for this state, viz., 1\\;(1) = 2.83 k( 2) = 1.41 1\\;(3) = 1.41. Question 9-2 What are the (atomic) units of the quantities in Eqs. (9.15)? quantities to 51 units (see Appendix D). (9.150) (9.15b) (9.15c) Convert each of these One way to figure out the shape of tP2(x) is to consider the corresponding function for an infinite square well of the same width. This function, tP~oo)(x). is sketched in Fig. 9.7b. It is a simple sine function of wavelength >.~oo) = 4. The wavelength of the corresponding eigenfunction tP2(X) of the finite well is slightly larger than this value; as you can see from Eq. (9.15b). >'2 = 4.46. This means that almost a full oscillation of tP2(X) fits into the CA region of the asymmetric square well. But. unlike tP~OO)(x). the finite-well function is not zero at the classical turning points. where it must hook continuously to monotonically decaying functions in Regions I and 3. The rates of decay of the pieces of tP2(X) in these CF regions are not equal. because the decay constant for Region I is larger than that for Region 3. Hence tP2(X) renetrates more deeply into the CF region x > L than into the CF region x < O. In fact. the characteristic length for decay into Region 3 is 0.71 and for Region I is 0.35. Perhaps the most subtle feature of the eigenfunction tP2(x) is the effect of this differ- ence in the characteristic lengths upon the location of the node in the CA region. Because 366 Chap . 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II t/J2(X) penetrates almost twice as deeply into the region x > L as it does into the region x < 0, the value of 1t/J2(X)1 at x = L must he larger than the value at x = O. Consequently the position of the node in t/J2(X) must be to the right of the midpoint of the well, i.e., at some x > L/2. Putting together these Sherlockian deductions, we come up with the sketch in Fig. 9.7b. (This sketch shows all the major features of the accurate, numerical solution of the TISE for this state.) Note that even though the potential (9.14) is certainly not symmetric, t/J2(X) (like all eigenfunctions) conforms to the nodal structure (9.13). Question 9-3 Sketch the eigenfunctions for the ground state of the potential in Fig. 9.7a. Question 9-4 In Example 9.1, we used the value of E2 to calculate the wavelength and decay constants of a stationary state. Doing so requires having solved the TISE, at least for the eigenvalues. But the arguments illustrated by this example don't require knowledge of the energy or, indeed, of the parameters Vo and L that define the well. Consider an arhitrary asymmetric square well that supports at least three bound states. Sketch the eigenfunctions for these three states. A Note on Parity In Â§ 8.7, I remarked that the bound stationary-state eigenfunctions of any symmetric potential have definite parity: they are either even or odd under inversion through the midpoint of the potential. which point we usually choose as x = O. (We'll prove this property in Â§ 9.4.) Although not a consequence of the nodal structure of these functions , this \"parity structure\" is clearly related to the nodal structure, for an eigenfunction of definite parity can have a node at the midpoint of the potential only if the eigenfunction is odd. The relationship between parity and nodes explains why the parities of the eigen- functions of a symmetric potential alternate with increasing n. We start with the ground- state eigenfunction, which has the minimum (allowed) curvature and hence no nodes. Consistent with this fact, the ground-state eigenfunction is even. Going up the ladder of stationary bound states, we find that with each increase by 1 of the quantum number n, the number of nodes increases by 1. The spatial function for the first excited state has a node at the midpoint of V(x), but the function for the second excited state does not. And so the parity of the eigenfunctions 1/Jfl(x) alternates : even, odd, even, odd, ... . This property is illustrated for the symmetric finite square well in Figs. 8.23, for the double-dip potential in Fig. 9.6a, and for the simple harmonic oscillator in Fig. 9.14 below. One Last Trick: Amplitude Variation Before turning to the mathematical solution of the TISE, I want to show you one more feature of the qualitati Ie solution of this equation : the variation of the amplitude of an eigenfunction In a CA region.\" This property follows from the continuity conditions on 1/JE(X) and the variation of the local wavelength with E - V(x) . 5The development in this section draws on the discussion in A. P. French and E. F. Taylor, 39, 961 (1971). Sec. 9.3 The Stationary States of an Arbitrary Potential 367 To deduce the principles of amplitude variation, we'll consider the first excited state of the piecewise-constant potential in Fig. 9.8a. Notice that this potential is not symmetric. V(x) ---- ......

(b) A sketch of the eigenfunction ala) > a(2) for the first-excited state of this potential and its counterpart for an infinite well of (b] width L with V3 = O. Let's see if we can figure out how the piece of the eigenfunction '1/J2(x) in the CA Region 2 differs from the piece in the CA Region 3. Since V3 > V2 , the wave numbers in Regions 2 and 3 bear the relationship k3 < k 2 â€¢ So the de Broglie wavelengths of these pieces are >'2 ~J?:K 2h2J 1 < ~3~J2~2h2J 1 . m E 711 E-V3 (9.16) Since >'2 < >'3. the curvature oftP~)(x). the piece in Region 2, is greater than that of 'ljI~)(x).the piece in Region 3. To show you the consequences of this change in curvature and wavelength for the amplitude of the eigenfunction, I want to construct a function that is continuous across the boundary between Regions 2 and 3. [We can't use the logarithmic derivative (Â§ 8.7) for this purpose, because when we form this quantity, by dividing d'ljlE(X)/dx by tPE(X), the amplitude of the eigenfunction cancels.] The particular function I want to construct 368 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.18a) (9.18b) (9.20a) (9.20b) involves the pieces of the eigenfunction in each region, the first derivatives of these pieces, and the wavelengths. Let's start with the general form of the eigenfunction in each region . Since this potential is piecewise-constant, we can easily write down these forms using principles from Chap. 8, viz., 1P~)(x) = C(2) cosk2x + D(2) sink2x (9.17a) 1P~)(x) = C(3) cosk3x + D(3) sink3x. (9.17b) The constants C(q) and D(q) make the manipulation of these forms more complicated than necessary. So let's use elementary trigonometry to rewrite Eq. (9.17) in terms of an amplitude C(q) and a phase constant 4>q, to wit: 1P~)(x) = C(2) sin (k2x + 4>2) 1P~)(x) = C(3) sin (k3x + 4>3)' The first derivatives of these functions are d~1P~)(x)= k2C(2) cos (k2x + 4>2) (9.19a) :x 1P~)(x)= k3C(3) cos (k3x + 4>3) . (9.19b) If we now square Eqs. (9.18) and (9.19), add the results in each region , introduce the wavelengths (9.16), and rearrange a little, we obtain [1P~)(x)f+ (2~)2>,~ [d~1P~)(x)]2 = [C(2)f [1P~)(x)f+ (2~)2>'5 [~1P~)(X)r= [C(3)f Look very carefully at Eqs. (9.20). They are written in terms of two quantities that must be continuous across the boundary between the classically-allowed regions: 1PE(X) and d1PE(X)jdx. Consider values of x extremely near this boundary. The wavelengths on the right-hand side change abruptly across the boundary, >'3 > >'2. But the eigenfunction on the left-hand side must be continuous, so to compensate for the change in the wavelength, the amplitudes on the right-hand side must be related by C(2) < C(3). This derivation confirms the principle used to draw the sketch in Fig. 9.8b : the amplitude of the spatial function is larger in the region where the wavelength of the function is larger. We .an generalize these findings to a continuous potential by imagining such a potential as an infinite number of piecewise-constant pieces (cj., Fig. 8.2). We must, of course, keep in mind that the amplitude of a spatial function for a continuous potential is not constant. So the continuous variation in E - V(x) causes a continuous change in the curvature and the amplitude of 1PE(X) of the following sort: Rule The amplitude of an oscillatory piece of a bound-state spatial function increases with de- creasing curvature, i.e., with increasing wavelength. Sec. 9.3 The Stationary States of an Arbitrary Potential 369 As a final illustration of this rule, consider the bound-state eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator potential (Â§ 9.8) shown in Fig. 9.16. Notice the pronounced variation of the amplitude of states of high quantum number n. Question 9-S Explain how to justify this generalization by representing a continuous potential as an infinite number of infinitesimally small steps, as in Fig. 8.2. Question 9-6 Suppose that the first derivative of 1/JE(X) happens to be zero at a step increase in a piecewise- constant potential like the one in Fig. 9.8a. Show that the amplitude of such an eigenfunction does not change across the region boundary . *9.4 MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES OF BOUND-STATE EIGENFUNCTIONS In our inquiry into the qualitative nature of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions for bound states of a one-dimensional potential, we've uncovered several important properties: 1. 'l/Jn(x) must go to zero in the asymptotic limits x -> Â±oo; 2. 'l/Jn(x) and d'l/Jn(x)jdx must be continuous everywhere; 3. the curvature of 'l/Jn(x) varies with IE - V(x)l, and influences the wave properties of this function as follows: as IE - V(x)1 increases in a CA region in a CF region { amplitude decreases k(x) increases A(X) decreases { 1\\:(X ) increases 1j 1\\:(X ) decreases (9.21) 4. 'l/Jn(X) has n - 1 nodes (if n = 1 denotes the ground state); 5. for a symmetric potential, the eigenfunctions 'l/Jn(x) alternate parity with increasing n, beginning with an even ground-state 'l/JI (x). Before turning to the mathematical solution : of I ie TISE, I want to prove for you the last of these properties : the parity of the eigenfunctions of a symmetric potential.\" But before we can prove this property , we must prove that the functions we're talking about are unique. On the Uniqueness of Bound Stationary-State Eigenfunctions The uniqueness of physically admissible solutions of the one-dimensional TISE follows from the fact that this is a second-order ordinary differential equation . For each value of E, this equation has two linearly-independent solutions. But, since the TISE is homogeneous, any linear combination of these functions is a third solution (for the same energy); so actually there exist an infinite number of solutions . We select one out of 6If you choose to omit this section, at least read the two Proclamations in it. 370 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.22b) (9.22a) this infinite pile of solutions by specifying the value of the eigenfunction and its first derivative at a single point or, equivalently, the value of the eigenfunction at two points.\" Of all these solutions, we want the one that satisfies property [I] above: the norrnalizable solution. We know from Â§ 9.2 that norrnalizable solutions to the TISE don 't exist for all values of E . But here I want to consider a related question that arises once we have found a norrnalizable solution: is it unique? Proclamation 9.1 Normalizable solutions of the one-dimensional TISE are unique (to within an arbitrary global phase factor). Argument: We'll prove this assertion using the time-honored technique of proof by contradiction. That is, we'll pretend that Proclamation 9.1 is false-e.g., that there exist two distinct solutions of the TISE for a single energy, say 1/Jn(x) and Xn(x): IF 2m -d21/Jn(x) = --2 [En - V(X)]1/Jn(X) X 1i d 2 2m -d2Xn(x) = --2 [En - V(X)]Xn(X), X 1i Then from Eqs. (9.22) we'll derive a relationship between 1/Jn(x) and Xn(x) that unmasks these two functions as aliases of one another-i.e., we'll prove that these functions represent the same physical state. Two such functions are not distinct, so our relationship will contradict the supposition, thereby proving the proclamation.f To relate 1/Jn(x) and Xn(x), let's combine Eqs. (9.22a) and (9.22b) by multiplying the first by Xn(x) and the second by 1/Jn(x) and subtracting the results, viz., d 2 d 2 Xn(x) dx 21/Jn(X) -1/Jn(x)dx 2Xn(x) = O. (9.23) A clever way to simplify Eq. (9.23) is to reduce the order of differentiation by rewriting the left-hand side as a total derivative, Integrating this equation, we obtain [Xn(x) d~1/Jn(x) -1/Jn(x)d~Xn(x)] = constant. (9.240) (9.24b) Question 9-7 If you are not familiar with this step, take a few minutes to verify that Eq. (9.240) is equivalent to Eq. (9.23). Then take a few more minutes to memorize this trick-it will serve you long and well. 7That is why the value of tP~)(x) and its first derivative at the boundary between an outer CF region and the adjacent CA region determine the function tPE(X) . llThe word \"distinct\" here is critical. Recall (Chap. 3) that two wave functions are distinct if they represent different quantum states of the systems. But two wave functions that differ only by a global phase factor represent the same physical state and so are not distinct. Sec. 9.4 Mathematical Properties of Bound-State Eigenfunctions 371 Now, what is the value of the constant in Eq. (9 .24b)? Well, the left-hand side of this equation must, obviously, be the same for all x. We know the values of 1/Jn(x) and Xn(X) (even for an arbitrary potential) in the limits x -+ 00 and x -+ -00: they are zero. So the constant in (9.24b) must be zero, and we can write this equation as We can now integrate Eq. (9.25) to obtain the simple relationship In1/Jn(x) = InXn(x) + C, (9.25) (9.26) where C is the constant of integration. Hence the solutions oiEqs. (9.22) are proportional: Xn(X) = C1/Jn(x) , (9.27) But the constant of proportionality in Eq. (9.27) is not arbitrary. Both 1/Jn(X) and Xn(X) must be normalizable, i.e.. i:1/J~(x)1/Jn(X) dx =i:X~(x)Xn(X) dx = 1, (9.28) and these conditions can be satisfied only if the modulus of C is unity. So C must have the form C = ei6 , where 8 is an arbitrary real constant. Hence our two supposedly distinct solutions of the TISE are related by (9.29) Ah hal-the constant ei6 is just a global phase factor. Such a factor is physically meaningless, because it disappears from such measurable quantities as observables and probabilities (Â§ 3.5). So the wave functions (9.30) are physically equivalent, which means that 1/Jn(x) and Xn (x) are not distinct solutions to (9.22) . This contradiction of our premise proves that each normalizable bound-state eigenfunction of a one-dimensional Hamiltonian is unique. Q. E. D. This proof establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the energies of bound stationary states and the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian, (9.31) Physicists express this correspondence as follows: Rule The bound-state energies of a single particle in a one-dimensional potential are non-degener- ate. (This rule does not apply to potentials in more than one dimension or to systems consisting of more than one particle.) 372 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II Question 9-8 Apply the result we just proved to the function Xn(X) = 1/J~(x) and thereby prove that we are always free to choose the eigenfunctions of a single particle in one dimension to be real functions. The Consequences of Symmetry Now that we have established the uniqueness of the bound-state eigenfunctions of a one-dimensional potential, we can prove: Proclamation 9.2 The bound-state eigenfunctions of a symmetric potential have definite parity. Argument: To determine the parity of a function, we invert the spatial coordinate x through the origin , i.e., x -; -x. Since we're interested in the behavior of a solution of the TISE under this operation, let's see what happens when we invert x in this equation. The symmetric potential doesn't change , V( -x) = V(x), symmetric potential (9.32) (9.33) so under this inversion, the TISE is transformed into? tf2 2m -d2'l/Jn(-x) = -~[En - V(X)]'l/Jn(-x). x Ii This equation is identical to the TISE; i.e., 'l/Jn(-x) satisfies the same differentialequation as does 'l/Jn(x) . And 'l/Jn(-x) satisfies the same boundary conditions as does 'l/Jn(x). But for a given allowed energy, there is only one distinct, nonnalizable Hamiltonian eigenfunction (see Proclamation 9.1). So 'l/Jn(X) and 'l/Jn(-x) must be related by Eq. (9.29), (9.34) Since we're free to choose 'l/Jn(x) to be real (see Question 9-8), the factor in Eq. (9.34) is ei6 = Â±1, i.e., (9.35) Therefore each eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian for a symmetric potential is either even or odd under inversion through x = O. Q. E. D. Proclamation 9.2 is the first of many symmetry arguments you 'll encounter in your study of quantum physics. I cannot overstate the power of symmetry. It is little exaggeration to say that when you perceive the symmetry properties of a system (i.e ., of 9The second derivative does not change under this inversion, because -~-- dx x-- x dx d d Sec. 9.4 Mathematical Properties of Bound-State Eigenfunctions 373 its potential), you peer into the deepest level of its physics. And such arguments have a practical side, for they invariably simplify the solution of the Schrodinger Equation. 9.5 THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR MADE SIMPLE Yet my classic lore aggressive (If you'll pardon the possessive) Is exceedingly impressive When you're passing an exam. -from The Grand Duke by Gilbert and SuIlivan Harmonic oscillators are useful models of complicated potentials in a variety of disci- plines-including the quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation, the study of lattice vibrations in crystalline solids, and the analysis of infrared spectra of diatomic molecules (Â§ 9.6). You probably remember the classical description of oscillatory motion from a high school or freshman physics class in which you studied the simple harmonic oscillator (SUO). Actually, classical systems rarely execute simple oscillatory motion; more often they undergo damped or forced harmonic motion.!? But even if particles execute \"complicated\" harmonic motion, their small excursions about equilibrium can be accurately approximated by the simple harmonic oscillator. So the SHO is the starting point for study of any system whose particles oscillate about equilibrium positions. What is \"Simple\" Harmonic Motion? Consider a point moving serenely along the circumference of a circle at a constant angularfrequency Wo, as in Fig. 9.9. The projection of this point on the diameter of the circle, x(t) in the figure, executes simple harmonic motion; i.e., x(t) changes with time according to a simple equation involving the frequency wo, the amplitude of motion A, and a phase constant 4J: x(t) = Asin (Wnt + 4J) . simple harmonic motion (9.36) The angular frequency Wo is usually called the natural frequency. The classical oscil- lation frequency Yo is related to the natural frequency by Yo = wo/(27f). The relationship of the function (9.36) to its second derivative is also simple: d? 2 (dx2x(t) = -Wox t) . (9.37) This is the famous differential equation of simple harmonic motion. Notice that the amplitude and phase constant have disappeared from Eq. (9.37). IOThis section consists primarily of a review of the physics of classical simple harmonic motion. For a more advanced treatment, see Chaps. 4 and 5 of Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems, 2nd ed. by J. B.

The projection on the diameter of a circle of a point moving along the circumference. The Macroscopic Simple Harmonic Oscillator The most famous simple harmonic oscillator is the mass on a spring in Fig. 9.lOaY If the wall to which the spring is hooked is immovable, and if the spring is \"ideal\" (i.e., has no mass and doesn't deform), and if friction and gravity are negligible, then the force on the mass acts to restore it to its equilibrium position x e , as illustrated in Fig. 9.lOb. The force exerted by a spring with force constant k f is linear: force on mass m = -kf(x - x e ) Hooke's Law. (9.38) The corresponding trajectory x(t), derived from Newton's Second Law, is d 2 k d 2x(t) = _-1. x(t ). (9.39) x m Adroitly noticing the similarity between Eq. (9.39) and the mathematical equation of simple harmonic motion, (9.37), we conclude that the mass is a simple harmonic oscillator whose natural frequency is related to the physical properties of the system (the mass and the force constant of the spring) by Wo = ~. (9.40) In practice, the amplitude and phase constant in the trajectory (9.36) are determined from the initial conditions x(t o). The potential energy of the particle follows simply from the force (9.38),12 V(x) = - J(Force on mass m)dx (9.410) 1 2 1 2 2= '2kf X = '2mwox , (9.4Ib) 11 For a review of this classic example of classical simple harmonic motion. see Chap. 14 of Funda- mentals of Physics, 2nd ed. by D.

Symon (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1971). !:lActually, the integral in (9.410) determines V(x) only to within an arbitrary constant, the zero of energy, which ('II choose at the bottom of the well.

Also shown are the classical turning points Â±xE for a particle with total energy E. as shown in Fig. 9.9c. The total energy of the particle is just V(x) plus its kinetic energy, i.e., p2 1 E = - + -mw 2x 2 â€¢ (9.42) 2m 2 0 The total energy is, of course, conserved. As the particle oscillates back and forth, its kinetic energy and hence its speed changes because the potential energy in (9.42) changes. For example, at equilibrium, the particle's potential energy is zero. So its speed is greatest at this point. On the other hand, the particle's kinetic energy is zero at the classical turning points, XE = Â±V 2E2 â€¢ classical turning points of the SHO (9.43) mwo So as it nears these points, the particle slows down; at them, it stops dead in its tracks and turns around. From these observations we can predict the outcome of a measurement of the po- sition of a classical simple harmonic oscillator. Were we to perform such a measurement at an arbitrary time during one period of oscillation, we'd most likely find the particle at positions where its speed is the smallest, i.e., near the classical turning points. Later in this chapter, we'll compare this prediction with what quantum physics predicts for a 376 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.44) microscopic oscillator. To prepare for this comparison, let's construct the classical coun- terpart of the quantum-mechanical probability density-the classical position probability density PcI(x)-and write this quantity in terms of x and E. The Classical Probability Density To define a probability we must first identify an ensemble (Â§ 3.3): a large number of identical, non-interacting systems, all in the same state. But in a position measurement at a fixed time, all members of an ensemble of macroscopic particles would yield the same result. So to develop a classical probability function we must adapt the concept of an ensemble to a macroscopic system. In this section only, I' II deviate from our usual use of the word \"ensemble.\" Here we'll assume that the positions of members of the ensemble are measured at random times. 13 In such a measurement, particles will be found at various places along the trajectory of the state, so the results will fluctuate according to the probability function we'll now derive. By analogy with the quantum-mechanical position probability density, we define the classical position probability density as P. ( ) d - probability of finding the particle in the c1X X- . , interval x to x + dx . Although we seek an expression for PcI(x) in terms of x and E, our starting point is the definition (9.44), which involves time. The time required for the particle to carry out one cycle of simple harmonic motion is the classical period To, To = 211\" â€¢ period of a classical simple harmonic oscillator (9.45) Wo [Don't confuse the period with the kinetic energy T = p2/(2m)] . So the probability function (9.44) is the fraction of one period that the particle spends in the interval dx at z , i.e., Classical probability density (9.46) Now let's transform (9.46) into an expression in the variable x. The infinitesimal dt is related to an infinitesimal of position , dx, by the velocity v = dx/dt . Using this fact and Eq. (9.45), we can eliminate t from PcI(x), viz., Wo 1 PcI(x) dx = -- dx. (9.47) 211\" v Now we must express v in terms of x and E. This isn't hard for the simple harmonic oscillator, because we know the trajectory, (9.36), Viz.,14 13There is an alternate way to define an ensemble of macroscopic systems so that the members will exhibit different values of an observable : randomize the initial conditions. But this approach is inappropriate to the present argument, for systems with different initial conditions are not in the same physical state. 14To avoid clutter in these equations, I've chosen the initial conditions so that the phase constant is 4J = O. Convince yourself that this choice corresponds to a state in which the particle is initially at the rightmost classical turning point. i.e.â€¢ to x(to) = +XE . Sec. 9.5 The Harmonic Oscillator Made Simple 377 x(t) = XE sin (Wot) V(t) = WOXE COS (Wot) . (9.48a) (9.48b) Since v(t) involves the cosine of wot and x(t) involves the sine of the same argument, we can combine Eqs. (9.48) according to the familiar trigonometric identity (see Appendix H) cos () = viI - sin 2 (), obtaining (9.49) Using this result, we can express the classical probability as a function of x, to wit: Wo 1 1 1 PcI(X) dx = -2 vi 2 2 dx = -2 vi 2 2 dx. 1rwo XE-X 1r XE-X (9.50) This function is the relative probability that in a measurement at a random time of the position of a macroscopic simple harmonic oscillator with energy E, we'll obtain a value in the infinitesimal range dx at x. Notice carefully that the dependence of this quantity on energy is implicit in the classical turning points under the square root sign [cf., Eq. (9.43)]. Alas, we cannot meaningfully compare Eq. (9.50) to the usual quantum probability density. Can you figure out what is wrong and how to fix it? â€¢â€¢â€¢ Pause while reader ponders â€¢â€¢â€¢ Right: PcI(X) is a relative probability density. We must normalize this function so that, like its quantum cousin, it satisfies The absolute normalized classical probability density is (9.51) simple harmonic oscillator (9.52) Question 9-9 Derive Eq.

Make explicit the energy dependence of this function, obtaining 378 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.53) This function is sketched in Fig. 9.11 at three energies, which just happen to equal those of three stationary states of the microscopic simple harmonic oscillator in Â§ 9.8. Re- assuringly, these sketches are consonant with our classical expectations: Pr.I(x) predicts that a macroscopic simple harmonic oscillator is least likely to be found at equilibrium, where it is moving most rapidly, and most likely to be found near the classical turning points, at which points it will stop and turn around. -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 (a) 3 4 5 x -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 (b) 2 3 4 5 x -7 -5 -3 -1 0 (e) 3 5 7 x Figure 9.11 The classical probability function for three energies.

Sec. 9.5 The Harmonic Oscillator Made Simple 379 *9.6 AN APPLICATION: THE VIBRATIONS OF A DIATOMIC MOLECULE Isn't it astonishing that all these secrets have been preserved for so many years just so that we could discover them! -Orville Wright June 7, 1903 One of the most interesting applications of the microscopic simple harmonic oscillator is to contemporary research on molecular vibrations.P Molecules are complicated beasties, and understanding their structure and spectra requires coping with complicated, non- spherical potentials generated by two or more force centers (the nuclei) and by lots of electrons. Fortunately, one can study the physics of the nuclei and electrons of most molecules separately. A diatomic molecule consists of two positively-charged nuclei (of mass e- 10-28 kg) and a bunch of electrons (each of mass me = 9.1 X 10-3 1 kg). If the molecule is e1ec- tricalIy neutral, there are enough bound electrons that their total negative charge exactly cancels the positive charge of the nuclei. In nature, bound states of molecules abound- which leads one to wonder: What holds a molecule together? The subject of molecular binding is, to say the least, vast.!\" Some molecules (e.g., NaCl) are held together by ionic bonds in which (crudely speaking) the molecule is bound by electrical forces between the composite positively and negatively charged ions. Others are held together by covalent bonds, where the reason for stability is more subtle. In such a molecule, the bound electrons, which are in a stationary \"electronic state,\" provide a potential energy that supports several bound stationary states of the nuclei. 17 Were the nuclei of a diatomic molecule macroscopic particles, their geometry would resemble the dumbbell in Fig. 9.12. Three kinds of nuclear motion occur: 1. translation through space; 2. rotation about the internuclear axis or about an axis perpendicular to this one; 3. vibration along the internuclear axis. It is the last of these quantum \"motions\" that, for certain quantum states, can be approx- imated by simple harmonic motion. 15This section is just an extended example designed to convince you that the harmonic oscillator is worth the work we're about to put into it and to give you insight into how it can be used as a model. You can skip this section and still handle the rest of the chapter without difficulty. 16For a brief overview, see Chap. 11 of Quantum States of Atoms. Molecules. and Solids by M. A. Morrison. T. L. Estle, and N. F. Lane (Englewood-Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall. 1977). For more detail, see Bonding Theory by Donald J. Royer (New York: McGraw-Hili. 1968) or nearly any chemistry text. 17This is a crude statement of one of the theoretical bulwarks of molecular physics: The Born- Oppenheimer approximation. This approximation is based on the relative masses of the electrons and nuclei : the former are orders of magnitude lighter than the latter, and so respond very quickly to changes in the nuclear geometry . We can conjure an (admittedly crude) analog of this approximation by imagining two hippopotami in a swamp . Surrounding the hippos is a swann of mosquitos . As the hapless hippos lumber about , the light, carefree mosqu itos whiz around, readjusting their positions in response to changes in the \"dihippo force centers\"-their goal being to maximize their blood intake. For a somewhat more scholarly discussion of this approximation, see Chap. 12 of Quantum States of Atoms. Molecules. and Solids by M. A. Morrison. T. L. Estle, and N. F. Lane (Englewood Cliffs , N.J.

Figure 9.13 shows the electronic potential energy in which the two protons of this molecule vibrate. It is easy to understand the large-scale features of these curves . As the nuclei get very close together (R -+ 0) their repulsion overwhelms the attractive electron-nuclei interactions, and the potential asymptotically approaches +00 . As the nuclei separate, they ultimately dissociate into neutral atoms or ions; this behavior is reflected in the slow decay of V(R) as R -+ 00 . 19 The lowest-lying curve in this figure is the ground electronic state, which is attrac- tive and which supports several bound vibrational states . But, although the motion of the nuclei in this state is oscillatory, it is not simple harmonic .

Atomic Data. 2. 119 (197\\).) The function V(R) deviates from that of a simple harmonic oscillator because the restoring forces that act on the nuclei are not linear. But consider values of R very near the minimum of the well-i.e., consider small excursions from equilibrium, R ~ Re â€¢ Here the potential energy is roughly quadratic in the displacement R - Re â€¢ Denoting this displacement by x:=R-R e , displacement from equilibrium (9.54a) we can write an approximate potential energy for small-amplitude vibrations, in terms of the force constant kf of the molecule. as20 (9.54b) How good an approximation is the simple harmonic oscillator? In Fig. 9.14, this potential is compared to a very accurate model of a true electronic energy curve, the Morse potential (cf, Fig. 8.2). The Morse potential lacks some of the simplifying features of the simple harmonic oscillator: it is not symmetric and does not increase to infinity as R -+ 00. Consequently, the Morse potential supports only a finite number 20The nuclei of a polyatomic molecule (i.e.â€¢ one with more than two of the little beggars) can execute a number of different kinds of vibrational motion. each of which is called a normal mode of vibration. The easiest road to insight into the (vibrational) physics of such molecules is via a powerful and beautiful branch of mathematics called group theory. See. for example. Chemical Applications of Group Theory, 2nd ed. by F. A. Cotton (New York: Wiley. 1971). 382 Chap . 9 States of a Particle in One Dimens ion II VIR) of bound states, and its bound-state eigenfunctions don't have definite parity. These differences notwithstanding, the low energies and eigenfunctions of the simple harmonic oscillator are surprisingly good approximations to a more accurate solution of the TISE for nuclear vibrations. Aside: Molecular Vibrations in the Laboratory. Experimentalists studying molec- ular vibrations measure such molecular properties as the natural frequencies and force constants in Table 9.1. A widely-used method for such measurements is observation of photons emitted or absorbed when a transition occurs between two stationary vibra- tional states. From measured spectra, physicists can also determine other quantities crucial to understanding the physics of the molecule, quantities such as the dipole moment function D(R) .21 The dipole moment of a molecule is analogous to that of a classical charge distribution. Assuming that the only motion the nuclei execute is vibrational, one finds that the mostprobable transition is one in whichthe vibrational quantum number n changes by one unit. These transitions are well described by the simple harmonic oscillator model. (The analysis of molecular spectra is complicated by the fact that real molecules rotate as well as vibrate. We'll learn how to represent molecular rotations in Part VI, where we'll discover that, like the vibrational energy, the rotational energy of a molecule is quantized. In the analysis of a real molecule, we must take such rotations into account.) In the lab, one cannot measure directly the function D(R) , because the min- imum vibrational energy of a molecule is non-zero, i.e., in every state, the nuclei vibrate. So spectroscopists measure two quantities from which they construct the dipole moment function D(R) . From the (infrared) transition intensities they can deduce the slope dD(R)/dR at R e â€¢ And, by studying the response of the molecule to an external electric field (see Volume II), they can figure out the expectation values of D(R) in the various stationary vibrational states. For example. the dipole moment of HCI (at equilibrium) is 1.085 x 10- 18 SC-cm and its derivative (at equilibrium) is 0.86 x 10- 111 SC. 2 2 21 See, for example, Â§ 4.12 of Molecular Structure and Dynamics by W.

Because V(x) increases without limit as Ixl increases, it supports an infinite number of bound states but no continuum states. So in any stationary state, the particle is localized in the vicinity of the well, i.e., Pn(x, t) ---+1 O. x-Â±oo (9.58) Question 9-11 Is Eq. (9.58) correct for a non-stationary state? Before you answer, think carefully about how a non-stationary state is related to the stationary states of a system. (We'll study a non-stationary state of this system in Â§ 9.10). We know from Â§ 9.1-9.3 that each state (9.57) is non-degenerate (unique), and that we can take each 'l/Jn(x) to be real. We also know that, because the potential in the Hamiltonian (9.55) is symmetric, its eigenfunctions have definite parity, beginning with the even ground state. Finally, from curvature arguments we know that 'l/Jn(x) has n nodes.[Note carefully that, in contrast to Eq. (9.13), the ground state is labelled with n = 0, as 'l/Jo(x)]. These qualitative deductions are all very well, but how do we solve (9.56) for the bound-state eigenfunctions and energies? Therein lies the tale of this section. The Plan of Attack Mathematicians often solve second-order differential equations with the method of power series. Unfortunately, for Eq. (9.56), the method doesn 't work. 23 But we can transform Eq. (9.56) into an equation for which the method does work. Once we have 230irect application of this method to Eq. (9.56) leads to a three-term recurrence relation. But the solution of this equation contains at most two arbitrary constants, which is one too few. The problem is that this equation has a singularity at Â±oo. 384 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II done so, we simply expand the unknown function in our new equation in a power series, insert the series into the differential equation, and solve for the expansion coefficients. Table 9.2 contains an overview of the steps we'll carry out, so you can follow along.

But a practicing mathematician would recognize it as Weber's equation. Weber's equation is one of several differential equations whose analytic solutions have been exhaustively studied and tabulated. Be- cause of their importance in applied mathematics, these are called special functions.25 You will meet several special functions in this book, beginning with Hermite polynomials later in this section. Since the solutions to Weber's equation are known, we could just write them down and quit. But we wouldn't learn much. Many and varied are the differential equations of physics that can't be solved by well-known, well-studied, well-tabulated functions; and you must know how to cope with them. So let's press on with the plan outlined in Table 9.2 and solve Weber's equation. What Happens at Infinity One of the first things you should check when confronted by an unfamiliar differential equation is its behavior in the asymptotic limits of its variable . Some equations blow up in these limits-in which case we must factor out the asymptotic behavior of the unknown function before we can get down to solving the equation by a method such as expansion in a power series. (Mathematicians describe such points as singularities . By the way, some equations blow up at finite values, such as x = 0, so in general it's a good idea to go on a singularity hunt before you embark on the quest for a solution.) Weber's equation simplifies considerably in the limit of large F. As ~ ~ Â±oo, the second term in (9.61) grows, ultimately overwhelming the constant term f . Letting Xas(~) denote the limit of 1Pf. (~), we can write the asymptotic form of Weber's equation as (dd;2 - e) Xas(~)= O. (9.62) (9.63) 24D<m't confuse the energy variable with the binding energy of the finite square well, which in Chap. 8 we denoted by En. 25Students often ask why such functions are \"special.\" I know no better answer than that provided by W. H. Press, B. P. Flannery, S. A. Teukolsky, and W. T. Vetterling in their superb book Numerical Recipes: The Art ofScientific Computing (New York: Cambridge University Press., 1986): \"There is nothing particularly special about a special function except that some person in authority or a textbook writer (not the same thing!) has decided to bestow the moniker.\" The bible of special functions (for scientists and engineers) is the massive compendium Handbook of Mathematical Functions edited by M. Abramowitz and I. Stegun (National Bureau of Standards Applied Mathematics Series No. 55, November 1970). I find particularly useful Formulasand Theorems for the Special Functions of Mathematical Physics by W. Magnus, F. Oberhettinger, and R. P. Soni (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1966), which includes some little-known relationships involving these functions. 386 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.64a) Not surprisingly, Xas(~) is independent of the energy variable E, which disappeared from (9.61) in the limit. Equation (9.63) is almost the equation for a Gaussian function, d 2f ~2 = (e Â± 1) f(~)Â· Equation (9.64a) has two linearly independent solutions: the Gaussian functions e-e /2 and e+e/2 â€¢ But we are interested only in the solution to (9.63) for very large values of ~. In the asymptotic region, e - 1 ~ e, and Eq. (9.64a) becomes identical to (9.63). So introducing arbitrary constants A and B, we can write the general solution o/Weber's equation in the asymptotic region as Question 9-12 What is the width of ee/2? [solution for ~ -+ Â±oo]. (9.64b) Question 9-13 Substitute the general form (9.64b) into (9.63) and, using the fact that IeI is large, verify that it is indeed a solution . Do you see a problem with the asymptotic solution (9.64b)? As ~ -+ 00 , one of the terms blows up: e+e /2 -+ oc . From our solutions of the TISE for a piecewise-constant potential in Chap. 8 we know how to deal with such exploding terms: we kill them off by exploiting the arbitrariness of the constants in the general form . In Eq. (9.64b) we choose B = 0, thereby ensuring that the function tPE(~) decays to zero as ~ -+ 00 and hence is normalizable. So we have discovered how the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions of the simple harmonic oscillator behave in the asymptotic limit (9.65) Aside: More on the Asymptotic Solution of Weber's Equation. Strictly speaking, Eq. (9.65) describes the dominant behavior of 'l/JE(X) in the asymptotic limit. Closer examination of Weber's equation reveals that in this limit, it's satisfied by any function of the form A~ne-~ 2 / 2 , where n is an integer. As â‚¬ -. Â±oo, the decaying exponential dominates the growing power â‚¬n. In fact, for any positive constant Q , lim C e-oe = O. Q > 0 ~-oo Thus we regain Eq. (9.65). What Happens Everywhere Else Let's write tPf(~) in a way that incorporates what we know-its asymptotic behavior- and that represents what we don't know by a new function HÂ«(~) and a constant A : Sec. 9.7 The Quantum Simple Harmonic Oscillator-Solved! (9.66) 387 Eventually we'll determine A via the normalization condition , which, expressed in tenns of the dimensionless variable ~, reads (9.67) But t/J.(~) can satisfy this condition only if H.(~) does not befoul the asymptotic decay to zero of the Gaussian factor in (9.66). Our eigenfunction will be nonnalizable if H. (~) has the property that H.(~)e-e/2 l O. â‚¬-Â±oc (9.68) We already know a few things about the unknown function in (9.66). First, notice that the eigenfunction t/J.(~) depends on the energy variable E = 2Ej(nwo), but the asymptotic function does not. So I've labelled H.(~), the unknown function in (9.66), with E. Evidently, this function will playa role in determining the bound-state energies. Second, the function H.(~) should reflect the properties of the corresponding eigen- function t/J.(x) . One of these properties is the definite parity of this eigenfunction . The Gaussian e-e/ 2 is even, so H.(~) must be responsible for the parity of t/Je(x); i.e., v (x) is symmetric t/J,( -~) = Â±tP,(~) H.( -~) = Â±H.(~) parity condition . (9.69) Aside: A Clue in the Asymptotic Solution of Weber's Equation. I noted above that in the asymptotic limit Weber's equation is satisfied by any function of the fonn A~ne-~2/ 2, where n is an integer. This suggests a possible fonn for H.(~): a sum of powers of~, i.e., a polynomial, such as co~o+ C2e + C4~4 + ... (even parity) or Cl~l + cae + C5~5 + ... (odd parity). And indeed, this turns out to be the answer. The Differential Equation to Solve We began our assault on the TISE for the SHO by rewriting it in simplified notation and dimensionless variables (Table 9.3). Examination of the asymptotic behavior of the resulting equation revealed that its solution is dominated by a decaying Gaussian . We have factored this (known) function out of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction and must now derive an equation for the remaining, unknown function. To this end, let's substitute the form (9.66) for tP.(~) into Weber's equation (9.61). After a little algebra, we obtain Hermite equation (9.70) This equation is called the Hermite differential equation, after the French mathematician Charles Hermite (1822-190 I), who found and explored its solutions . These solutions are appropriately called Hermite functions. Question 9-14 Derive Eq. (9.70). 388 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II Our approach to the Hermite equation is quite simple (see Table 9.2). Most func- tions can be represented by a power series in their independent variable (e.g., the Taylor and Laurent series). So we'll try expanding Hl(~) in a series with unknown coefficients Cj , 00 = LCj~j. j = O (9.710) (9.7Ib) Of course, one or more of these coefficients may be zero. To determine their values, we will substitute this series into the differential equation for H, (~) and, exploiting the linear independence of the functions e. will derive a relationship between various of the coefficients. This relationship is called a recursion relation. Last, we'll impose the boundary conditions (9.68) . Doing so will limit the series to a finite number of terms and, as it happens, will determine the allowed energies of the oscillator. Question 9-15 Use the relationship between the Hermite functions H.(O and the Hamiltonian eigenfunc- tions 'I/J. (~) and your knowledge of the qualitative properties of these eigenfunctions to answer the following question: Which of the following describes the ~ dependence of the lowest -order term in the power-series expansion of the Hermite polynomial in the ground- state eigenfunction: a constant term, a term proportional to ~, or a tenn proportional to ~n where n > I? Next, answer this question for the first excited state. Power Series: A Quick Review Before we begin , I want to jog your memory regarding series expansions offunctions.26 You are probably familiar with expansions of elementary functions in power series . For example, the expansions of ef. and e-f., which solve the differential equations (d~Â± 1) f(~)= 0, are Â±f. 1 2 1 3 e = 1 Â± ~ + -~ Â± -~ + . .. 2! 3! 00 - '\" bÂ·d - L..J J\" , j=O where .1 b'=(Â±I)J- J .,'J. We can adapt this form to other functions, such as et;2: (9.720) (9.72b) (9.72c) 261f this summary isn't sufficient , see Chap. 5 of Mathematical Methods for Physicists, 2nd ed. by G. Arfken (New York: Academic Press, 1970) or Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 2nd ed. by Mary Boas (New York: Wiley, 1963). Sec. 9.7 The Quantum Simple Harmonic Oscillator-Solved! 389 (9.73a) (9.73b) To write a general form [analogous to (9.72b)] for the series (9.73b), we need only note that the powers in successive terms increase by 2; viz., where oc ee = L bj~j, j=O (even) (9.740) (9.74b) A crucial question concerning a series expansion of a function is: for what values of the independent variable does the series converge to the function? The region of ~ within which a power series I:~o bj~j converges to an analytic function f(~) depends on the behavior of the ratio of successive terms in the series as the summation index j becomes large. According to the d' Alembert ratio test, such a series converges for all ~ if the ratio of successive terms, bj+l~j+l/bj~j, goes to zero as j --+ 00. For example, the ratio of successive terms in the series (9.73) is 1 2 = -Â·-e '\" --:e ->0. J.. + 1 J j-+oc 2 (9.75) [Notice very carefully that Eq. (9.75) implies only that the series converges, not that it converges to zero.] Of course, this series does converge, to ee. Solving the Hermite Equation the Power-Series Way With this background, let's return to the series (9.71) for the Hermite function. What are the implications of the properties of the Hermite functions, Eqs. (9.68)-(9.69), for this series expansion? First, Hf(~) depends on the energy variable â‚¬, so at least one of the unknown coefficients Cj must also depend on e; i.e., Cj = Cj(â‚¬). Second, the parity condition (9.69) means that each function HE(~) will include either even powers of ~ (if it is even) or odd powers (if it is odd)-but not both. This property follows from the simple parity of z\", (_x)n = (-lY'x n = Â±x n . { n even n odd (9.76) That is, each Hermite function must have one of the following forms: even parity odd parity. (9.77) 390 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II One consequence of (9.77) is that for each Hermite function, one of the coefficients CO and Cl must be zero:27 H( (e) is even HÂ«(e) is odd CO =1= 0 and ci = 0 ci =1= 0 and Co = O. (9.78a) (9.78b) This requirement poses no problem. The function HÂ«(e) contains two arbitrary coef- ficients, so two of the Cj'S in (9.71) are arbitrary. One of these will appear in each even-parity function and one in each odd-parity function. At this point, I hope you are worried by the presence in the Hermite series of an infinite number of terms . The worry is that this series may blow up as e- 00. Such a detonation would not necessarily be a disaster, because it's the function (9.79) that must go to zero in the asymptotic limit. In fact, the blow up of these series is a disaster, for it dominates the decay of the Gaussian and renders the product of the two functions unnormalizable. Fortunately, we can avoid this disaster by making the series finite. This works because in the asymptotic limit, a decaying exponential dominates any finite polynomial.P\" So once we've derived the recurrence relation, we must find a way to terminate each series at a finite number of terms, so that it includes terms with incides . from j = 0 to j = jmax' The Algebra To substitute the series (9.71) into the Hermite differential equation, we need a couple of derivatives: dOC. deHÂ«(e) = I>Cje- 1 j=O ~ 00 de2 HÂ«(e) = Lj(j - 1)cjej- 2 â€¢ j=O Substituting these expansions in the Hermite equation, we get 00 00 00 Lj(j - 1)cjej- 2 - 2 LjCje j + (I: - 1) L Cje j = o. j=O j=O j=O (9.80a) (9.80b) (9.81) To extract from (9.81) a relationship between the coefficients Cj, we use the linear independence of the functions {I, e,e,e,... }. That is, the only linear combination of these functions that equals zero is the one with zero coefficients: 27Equations (9.78) apply to the solutions of the Hermite differential equation because . as we'lI see. in the even-parity solutions of this equation the lowest-order term is constant and in the odd-parity solutions the lowest-order term is proportional to e. In general. we can conclude only that for even-parity solutions C2,,+ 1 = 0 and for odd-parity solutions C2\" = O. :.!l:lSee. for example. Â§ 6.8 of Calculus and Analytic Geometry by G. B. Thomas (Reading. Mass. : Addison-Wesley. 19~). Sec. 9.7 The Quantum Simple Harmonic Oscillator-Solved! 391 Co = ci = C2 = ... = Â°I linear independence (9.82) To exploit this property, let's first manipulate Eq. (9.81) into the form 00 L (factors involving the Cj s) ~j = O. j=O (9.83) Then (9.82) allows us to set each factor equal to zero. The only term in (9.81) not already in the desired form is the first. This term contains ~j-2 instead of e. But look at this series: oc Lj(j - 1)cj~j-2 = 2C2 + 3Â· 2C3~+ 4Â· 3C4e + ... . j=O (9.840) To write (9.840) in the form (9.83), we need only reduce the value of the index j by 2; i.e., oc oo Lj(j - 1)cj~j-2 = L(j + 2)(j + 1)cj+2~j. j=O j=O (9.84b) Question 9-16 If you aren't familiar with the re-labelling of summations, a standard gambit in the solution of differential equations, this step may seem a bit magical. The key is that the factors j and j - 1 in (9.84a) kill the terms for j = 0 and j = 1. [a). Write out the first few terms in (9.84b) explicitly and verify that it is equivalent to (9.84a). [b). More formally, you can get the same effect by changing the index of summation from j to j f = j - 2. If j runs from 2 to 00, then j' runs from 0 to 00. Try this procedure, then replace i' by j and regain (9.84b). With this re-labelling, Eq. (9.81) assumes the form of (9.83): oc L [(j + 2)(j + 1)cj+2 + (e - 1- 2j)cj]~j= O. j=O (9.85) According to (9.82), the quantity in square brackets is zero. Therefore, successive coef- ficients Cj+2 and Cj in the series for the Hermite function are related by the two-term recurrence relation Cj+2 2j + 1 - f S = (j + 2)(j + 1)' [j=O,1,2, .. Â·j (9.86) Notice that the energy variable appears in this relation. \"What good,\" you may be wondering, \"is a two-term recurrence relation?\" Well, we can use this equation to determine the terms in the Hermite series from the arbitrary coefficients , CO and Cl . Taking into account the parity of these functions [Eq. (9.69)], we can write even parity (9.87) odd parity 392 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (!..=..:)2 CoÂ· Now, for the first coupled even parity solutions we have 1 -f C2 = -2-co 5-f (5-f)c4=12 c2= 12 Similarly, for an odd-parity function H.(~), 3-f C3 = -6-C1 7-f (7-f) (3-f) C5 = 2O c 2 = 20 -6- Cl ' (9.88a) (9.88b) So it looks like we're through. We have enough arbitrary coefficients to normalize the eigenfunctions, and we have developed clean forms for the Hermite functions of both parities: But there is a snake in Eden. even parity odd parity 2j + 1- f Cj+2 = (j + 2)(j + 1) Cj (9.89) Aside: Convergence of the Hermite Series. Is the problem lack of convergence? Does this series converge? Well, the ratio of successive terms is Cj+2~i+2 _ 2j + 1 - f 2 Cj~j - (j+2)(j+l)~' This ratio does go to zero as j --> 00 . So the series (9.89) do converge to an analytic function of~. The trouble is not whether this series converges, but what it converges to. Trouble at Infinity The form of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction (9.66) for the SHO is t/Je(~) = (infinite series in ~)(decaying Gaussian). (9.90) (9.91) For this function to be physically admissible, it must go to zero as ~ --> 00 . The easiest way to investigate the asymptotic behavior of a series is to relate it to an analytic function of ~. Mathematicians know a clever way to ferret out such relationships: compare successive terms ofthe series in this limit to successive terms in the expansions of various analytic functions. Let's apply this strategy to the even-parity Hermite series. (I'll ask you to deal with the odd-parity solutions in a question.) For large I~I, the dominant terms in this series are those with large indices, j. In the limit j --> 00, the ratio of successive terms in the Hermite series (9.89) behaves as ' + 2 Cj+2~J = ?j + 1.- f e \"J ~e. Cj~j (J + 2)(J + 1) j-.oo J Sec. 9.7 The Quantum Simple Harmonic Oscillator-5olved! 393 Now, 2e/j is precisely the ratio we found in Eq. (9.75) for the power-series expansion of the function f(f.) = ee. Therefore, in the asymptotic limit the series for an even-parity Hermite function behaves like this function, i.e., oc L Cjf.j ----+ ee. j=O lei-co (even) (9.92) (9.93) We have a problem. Look at the asymptotic behavior of the product of this infinite series and the decaying Gaussian: (f Cjf.j) e-e/2 ----+ eee-e/2 -. 00. j = O lei-x Since this product is not bounded, it cannot be normalized and hence isn't physically admissible.P? . The Terminator There is only one way out: we must terminate the series before it can blow up. That is, we must somehow force all coefficients Cj for j greater than some finite index jmax to be zero . This stratagem works because according to the recursion relation in (9.89), Cj+2 <X Cj, which implies that if Cjmax = 0, then Cj = 0 for all j > jmax ' (9.94) According to the recurrence relation (9.86), we can make Cjmax+2 equal to zero by choosing the energy variable e so that the numerator in this relation is zero. So the series is terminated at j max if e = 2jmax + 1. (9.950) For any value of jmax > 0, Eq. (9.950) forces the Hermite series to be finite . The resulting function is called a Hermite polynomial: imax H.(f.) = L Cjf.j j=O e = 2jmax + 1. (9.95b) 29This argument is heuristic, not rigorous . It can. however, be put on a rigorous foundation using a theorem concerning power series that was proved by D. F. Lawden [see his book The Mathematical Principles of Quantum Mechanics (London: Methuen, 1967Â»): consider two power series ~~o Cj~j and ~~o bj~j that, according to the d' Alembert ratio test, converge to functions fr (~) and h(~), respectively. If there exists a value of the index j-<:all it jo-such that for j 2': jo the coefficients of both series are positive and are related by bj/bj-t > Cj/Cj-t, then h(~) is bounded above by fr(~). Applying this theorem to the series for eE2 and for the Hermite funct ion. one can prove [Eqs. (9.74) and (9.85)] that the Hermite series is bounded by the exponential function , i.e., lim HE(~) < ee. E-Â±oo Any such function dominates the Gaussian e-e /2 in the asymptotic limit, leading to an exponential explosion. [This connection was pointed out in M. Bowen and J. Coster, Amer. Jour . Phys. 48,307 (1980).] 394 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II When we construct the Hamiltonian eigenfunction 'l/JE(f,) = AHE(f,)e- e / 2 with a Hermite polynomial, we obtain a function of the form 'l/JE(f,) = (finite series in f,)(decaying Gaussian). (9.96) Such a function does go to zero in the asymptotic limit. Whew! For example, the smallest value of irnax is irn ax = O. According to (9.95a), this choice corresponds to e = 1. This value of â‚¬ forces all coefficients other than CO to be zero, i.e., C2 = C4 = ... = O. The resulting Hermite polynomial has only one term, HE(f,) = Co, and is even. Here are a few more examples: irnax = 2 irnax = 3 irnax = 6 ~C4=C6=' ''=O ~ Cs = C7 = = 0 ~ Cg = CIO = = 0 ~ HE(f,) = Co + C2e :3 ~ HE(f,) = Clf, + c3f, (9.97) ~ HE(f,) = Co + C2e + C4f,4 + c6f,6. The Allowed Energies It is customary to label Hermite polynomials with the index n = irnax. So the three polynomials in Eq. (9.97) are H2(f,), H3(f,), and H6(f,). The index n is the highest power of f, that appears in the polynomial Hn(f,), and is called the degree of the polynomial. We also use n to label the energy variable e and write the restriction (9.95a) as â‚¬n = 2n + 1. (9.98) But this variable is related to the stationary state energies by En = nWOâ‚¬n/2 [see Table 9.3]. So the requirement that Hi; (f,) must be a finite polynomial restricts the energies of the simple harmonic oscillator to n ~O\"'2'''.1 (9.99) energy quantization==> For any value of E not of this form, the corresponding eigenfunction of the SHO Hamil- tonian contains an infinite polynomial and hence blows up at infinity-socially unac- ceptable behavior for a function that aspires to physical significance. Once again we have uncovered a subtle kinship between mathematics and physics, the latter limiting the solutions provided by the former: Iboundary conditions Question 9-17 Repeat the above argument for an odd-parity Hermite function, showing that this case leads to the same restriction on the series as we found for an even-parity function. Question 9-18 Question 9-15 explains why the series Eq (9.71) is appropriate to the Hermite equation. But in general, the lowest-order term in the solution of a differential equation could be proportional to eto some power, say p. If we cannot deduce this power, we can let the mathematics determine it by writing the series as Sec. 9.7 The Quantum Simple Harmonic Oscillator-SolvedI 395 cc f(~)=e LCj~j. j=O Substitute this form into the Hermite equation and show that p = 0 for the even-parity functions and p = 1 for the odd functions. 9.8 THE SHD-THE ANSWERS The key result of Â§ 9.7 was our discovery that only certain solutions of the Hermite equation yield physically admissible wave functions-namely, finite polynomials whose order n is related to the energy variable f by e = 2n + 1. These polynomials fall into two classes according to their parity: n Hn(~) = L cje j=O (even) n [Co arbitrary] n = 0,2,4, . . . (9.100) Hn(~) = L Cj~j j=I (odd) [CI arbitrary] n = 1,3,5, . .. (9.101)2 ~ j ~ n - 2. For functions of either parity, the coefficients Cj for j > 1 are determined from the recurrence relation (9.86), which we can write as , 2(j - n - 2) Cj = j(j _ 1) Cj-2 With this relation, you can easily generate lots of Hermite polynomials, if necessary. (Other mathematical properties of the Hermite polynomials are explored in Pblm. 9.11.) Example 9.2. The First Four Hermite Polynomials The lowest-order Hermite polynomial is the even function Ho(O, which, as we saw in Â§ 9.7, is simply Ho(~) = Co. It is conventional to choose Co = 1 (which we are free to do, since this coefficient is arbitrary), giving Ho(~) = 1. (9.1020) Not a major thrill. [The function (9.1020) is not, of course, the ground-state eigenfunction of the SHO; we'll construct and normalize that function in Example 9.3.] The Hermite polynomial for n = 1 is odd and consists of the single term CI~. Following convention, we choose CI = 1, which gives HI(~) =~. (9.102b) The next two polynomials are a bit more interesting. The Hermite polynomial for . n = 2 includes two terms: Co + C2e. According to the recurrence relation, the coefficient C2 is just -2 , S030 30More conventions : In tables of Hermite polynomials . the highest power of { always appears first. with a plus sign (see Table 9.4). Thus. the tabulated polynomials differ by an overall factor of - I from those calculated via the recurrence relation. In fact, we are free to multiply the Hermite polynomials by any constant we like. for they solve a linear. homogeneous differential equation and hence are arbitrary 10 within an overall multiplicative constant. . 396 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.102c) One more, then I'll stop. The form of the Hermite polynomial for n = 3 is H3(~) = Cl~+ cae. According to the recurrence relation, Ca = -2/3, so this polynomial is ( 2 3 H3 ~) = ~- 3~ . (9.102d) Mercifully, tables of Hermite polynomials exist (see Table 9.4), so we usually don't have to go through this tiresome process. Then again, you never know when you might be separated from your trusty tables and need a Hermite polynomial. Or you might need a special function that hasn't been tabulated.

[Adapted from Quantum Mechanics by K. Ziock (New York: Wiley. 1969).) Sec. 9.9 The SHD--The Physics 401 Probabilistic Properties of the SHO The probability density P,.(x) tells us what to expect in a position measurement on an ensemble of SHOs in the nth stationary state. The results predicted by these functions differ strikingly from those for a classical oscillator-as you can see by comparing PcI(x) in Fig. 9.11 to the corresponding Pn(x) in Figs. 9.16. The most obvious difference between these figures is that the classical oscillator cannot penetrate into aforbidden region. But no matter what its state, a quantum oscil- lator does penetrate into the classically forb idden regions . This penetration is greatest (i.e., the characteristic length is largest) for low-energy states (i .e., smallest n) and, as you can see in Fig. 9.16, it diminishes with increasing energy. Because of this decrease in the characteristic length as n -+ 00 , the microscopic oscillator does behave in this limit somewhat like its classical counterpart. You have probably already spotted several other differences between the quan- tum and classical probability densities. Compare, for example, these two functions (in Figs 9.11 and 9.15) for an energy E = 3nwo/2. (This is the first excited state of the microscopic oscillator.) If the physics of a particle with this energy were governed by classical physics, the particle would be most likely found near its classical turning points-precisely where, according to quantum physics, it is least likely to be found. Another striking difference is the nodes in the quantum-mechanical density functions, features that are absent from the classical densities. But look carefully what happens to these nodes (and to the associated peaks in Pn ) as the energy En of the microscopic oscillator increases: they appear to bunch together. Consequently the overall shape of Pn (x) for a large value ofn begins to look suspiciously like PcI(x). This phenomenon-an important clue to the connection between classical and quantum physics-is more evident in the quantum-mechanical density for a very large value of the energy, such as P60 (x) in Fig. 9.17. . This observation strongly intimates that the classical limit of a simple harmonic oscillator is the limit of large energy (large n) . And, as you'll see when you answer the next two Questions, it is. But be careful in taking this limit. The energy levels of the SHO En = (n + ~)nWo are equally spaced, so in the limit n -+ 00 , these energies do not merge to form a continuum. Instead, the separation between adjacent eigenvalues of the SHO, E n+! - En, is constant (nwo), and energy quantization-certainly a non- classical phenomenon-is preserved even as n -+ 00 . To see how to take the classical limit, consider the next two questions. Question 9-23 Show mathematically why the classical limit of the SHO is n -+ 00 via the following argument: Divide the CA region [-x,,,x,,] into a finite number m of equally-spaced in- tervals of size ~x. Let xm denote the midpoint of the m t h interval. Evaluate the average over one such interval of the quantum probability density Pn(x) and show that this average approaches Pcl(X) as n -+ 00 . In particular, show that 402 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II n =60 0.20 ~ II 0.16 I I I I II IIt S II I 0... 2 0.12 , I I , I , I 0.08 -8 0.04 0.0 LL.....L-.JU.,;IL..II....II-IOUUL -12 -4 o 4 8 Figure 9.17 The position probability density for a simple harmonic oscillator in the stationary state tP6n(x).

Ziock (New York: Wiley. 1969).] Question 9-24 The correspondence principle (cf., Â§ 4.2 and 5.7) relates classical and quantum mechanics by requiring the latter to reduce to the former in the classical limit. In many cases, we obtain the classical limit of a quantum-mechanical result by the artifice of setting Ii -> O. But this gambit won't work for the SHO energy spectrum of Fig. 9.18, because the energies of the simple harmonic oscillator are proportional to h: But the ratio of the spacing between adjacent levels to the energy of one of these levels behaves as follows in the limit of large energy: E n +1 - En 1 1 --\"..:....:::--~ = --I ----+ - -> o.

The natural frequency of the oscillator and the width Vo and depth L of the well were chosen so that the two systems have equal ground-state energies and the square well supports several bound states . Statistical PropertIes of the SHO The results of ensemble measurements of observables such as position, momentum, and energy are described by statistical quantities-expectation values and uncertainties-that we can calculate from the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian . If the state is stationary, the particle's energy is sharp, and the statistical quantities for this observable are simply (E) = En 1::J.E=O [nth stationary state]. (9.109) Only a bit more work is required to evaluate the expectation values and uncertainties for the other two key observables: position and momentum . The position probability densities in Fig. 9.16 show vividly that the position of a particle in the nth stationary state of a SHO is uncertain: 0< 1::J.x< 00 [nth stationary state]. (9.1 lOa) This means that the linear momentum is also uncertain, because the position and mo- mentum uncertainties must satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, 1::J.x 1::J.p :::: n/2: o < 1::J.p < 00 [nth stationary state]. (9.1 lOb) Thus does nature limit our knowledge of the position and momentum of a particle in a stationary state.32 The implications of Eq. (9.110) for experimental physics are clear: in an ensemble measurement of either position or momentum, individual results will fluctuate about the mean, (x)n or (P)n' We can calculate these expectation values for the nth stationary state from the definitions 32There do exist states of the simple harmonic oscillator for which the position or the momentum are sharp at certain times. But these states are not stationary. It is also possible to construct state functions (by superposing stat ionary-state wave functions) whose expectation values (x) and (p) mimic those of a classical oscillator. These states , called \"coherent quasi-classical states\", are also non-stationary. Coherent states play an important role in the quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation and in quantum optics . See, for example, Complement Gv in Quantum Mechanics, Volume I by C. Cohen-Tannoudji, B. Diu, and F. Laloe (New York: Wiley, 1977). 404 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (:C)n = 1:1{J~(x)x1{Jn(X)dx (P)n = -in ['X! 1{J~(X): 1{Jn(X) dx .L; x (9.111a) (9.111b) Or we can think for a moment and determine these average values without doing any work. The property of the eigenfunctions that renders trivial the determination of these expectation values is (you guessed it) parity. Look: the parity of x is odd, so regardless of the parity of 1{Jn(x), the integrand in (9.111a) is odd. Hence the integral is zero, and (x) n = O. Well, that was easy enough. Evaluating (9.111b) isn't much harder-if you remember that the first derivative of a function with even parity is an odd function, and vice versa: d functi functidx (even unction) = odd unction d~(odd function) = even function (9.112) Regardless of the parity of 1{Jn(x), this eigenfunction times its first derivative is odd. Hence the integrand in (9.111b) is odd, the integral is zero, and (P)n = O. But wait a minute: in no way did these proofs depend on the particular symmetric potential under consideration. That is, we used only the parity of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions, not the fact that they are eigenfunctions of the SHO oSo, almost without intending to, we've proven that nth stationary state of a symmetric V(x) (9.113) Knowing the expectation values of position and momentum makes evaluating their uncertainties easier. In this case, the expressions we must evaluate are [cf , Eq. (7.63)] (~X)n= V(x 2)n - (x)~= V(x 2)n (~P)n= V(P2)n - (P)~= V(P2)n' (9.1140) (9.114b) (9.115a) (9.115b) So the expectation values we must evaluate are (x 2)n =1:1{J~(x)x21{Jn(X)dx (p2)n = - n21:1{J~(x)::21{Jn(X) dx . General forms for the remaining integrals have been derived from the properties of the Hermite polynomials in the spatial functions (see Pblm. 9.11)-the answers appear in Table 9.7. WARNING The results in Table 9.7 pertain only to the simple harmonic oscillator; unlike Eq. (9.113), these integrals are not general properties of a stationary state.

Question 9-26 Evaluate the matrix element of p2 between two eigenfunctions of the simple harmonic oscillator . Example 9.4. The Position Uncertainty To evaluate (~X)n we need only look in Table 9.7 for the expectation value of x 2 , viz., (9.116)( 2) 2n + 1 ( 1) n En X n = ~ = n + 2 mwo = mW5' where I've used the definition of f3 and En = (n + ~) Ii Wo to express (x 2 ) n in a variety of handy forms. The position uncerta inty is just the square root of this expectation value, (9.117)[n th stationary state] (~X)n= J~(n + ~) =J(n + ~)m~o= J:~5' This result expresses quantitatively a trend we saw in Fig. 9.16: the position uncertainty increases with increasing energy (i.e., with increasing n). The quantity we just evaluated is a measure of the range of values of x where a microscopic particle with a SHO potential is likely to be found in an ensemble measurement of position. The classical counterpart of this quantity is defined by the classical turning points, Eq. (9.108). These points define the range of values -X n $ x $ X n where a macroscopic oscillator with energy En would be found. The position uncertainty is related to X n by (9.118) 406 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II so for this system, the position uncertainty turns out to be comparable to the classical range, i.e., (9.119) Question 9-27 Show that the average value of the potential energy of the SHO in the nth stationary state is (V(XÂ»n = ~mw5 (x '1.)n' = ~En. We'll return momentarily to the implications of this result. (9.120a) (9.120b) (9.121) Example 9.5. The Momentum Uncertainty At first glance, the prospect of evaluating the momentum uncertainty (9.114b) looks hor- rendous. In the position representation, p'1. = -Ii 2d '1./ dx '1., so the integrand in (9.115b) is a product of 1/Jn(x) and its second derivative, which, in tum, is the product of a Hermite polynomial and a decaying Gaussian. No doubt the resulting integral is one you and I don 't want to evaluate unless we absolutely have to. We don't have to. We can get rid of the second derivative of 1/Jn(X) by taking advantage of its appearance in the TISE, d'}. _li'1. dx '1. 1/Jn(X) = 2m [En - V(x)] 1/Jn(x). Substituting this form into (9.115b), we obtain a much simpler expression for the expectation value, (p'1.) n =I: 1/J~(x){2m [En - V(x)] }1/Jn(x) dx, = 2mEnI: 1/J~(X)1/Jn(X)dx - 2m (V(x))\" . (9.122a) (9.122b) Now look carefully at the two terms in (9. 122b). The Hamiltonian eigenfunctions are normalized, so the integral in the first term is unity. This reduces the expectation value to (p'1.)n = 2m [En - (V(x))n] ' [nth stationary state of any potential V(x)] (9.123) Notice that in this derivation, V(x) is arbitrary; nowhere did we use an explicit form of the simple harmonic oscillator potential or of its eigenfunctions. nor did we assume that these functions have definite parity. So Eq. (9.123) pertains to any bound stationary state of any one-dimensional potential . We apply Eq. (9.123) to the SHO by inserting the form of the potential, viz., (p'1.)n = 2m [En - ~mw5(x'1.)n] [ 1 2 En ]= 2m En - 2mwomw5 = mEn.

(9.125). Show that your result can be written (T)n = ~En. (9.126) Aside: The Virial Theorem in Quantum Physics. A most interesting feature of a macroscopic simple harmonic oscillator is the equal sharing of its total energy among kinetic and potential parts. Expressed mathematically, this result-ealled the Virial Theorem-reads E= 2T=2V [for a macroscopic SHO]. (9.I27a) 408 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II A similar relationship holds for a microscopic oscillator in a stationary state, as you discovered if you answered Questions 9-27 and 9-28. But the form of this relation reflects a fundamental difference between classical and quantum physics, for the quantum-mechanical Virial Theorem is expressed in terms of expectation values andpertains onlyto stationary-states of the oscillator. This theorem states that on the average, the total energy in a stationary state is equally partitioned among potential and kinetic parts, i.e., (9.127b) Of course, the expectation value in (9.127b) is just (E)n = En. 33 Question 9-29 Prove the following general relationship between the mean kinetic and potential energies of any stationary state, [1' + V(x)] 'l/Jn(X) = En'I/Jn(x) , ==> (T) + (V) = E. Now prove that the Virial Theorem (9.127b) is consistent with this relationship. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for the SHO Using our expressions for the position and momentum uncertainties for the nth stationary state of a simple harmonic oscillator, we can calculate the uncertainty product in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle-according to which these uncertainties for any state--- stationary or non-stationary-s-of any microscopic system , are related by (Ax)(Ap) ~ h/2. But the result, as calculated from the general forms in Table 9.9, is somewhat surprising : (9.128) The uncertainty product satisfies the uncertainty principle in a special way: for the ground state (n = 0) it is equal to h/2. 34 Question 9-30 From the data in Table 9.8, calculate the uncertainty products for the first five stationary states of the SHOo Question 9-31 What are the limiting values of (toX)n and (toP)n as n -+ oo? Is your answer consistent with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? 33For more on the Virial Theorem. see Chap. 14 of Quantum Chemistry 3rd ed. by I. N. Levine (Boston : Allyn and Bacon, 1983). 34This result may remind you of Â§ 4.5. where we showed that a Gaussian function is the wave packet of minimum uncertainty [see Eq. (4.69)] . But there is a crucial difference . In Chap. 4 we were discuss ing non-stationary states of a free particle ; in this chapter the same mathematical function has appeared as the ground-state eigenfunction .,po(x) of a panicle bound in a simple harmonic oscillator potential. There is nothing mysterious going on here; the feature that renders the uncerta inty product for this function a minimum is not the physical sign ificance of this function. but its mathematical form. Sec. 9.9 The SHo-The Physics 409 (9.129a) *9.10 THEINCREDIBLE SLOSHING OSCILLATOR Stationary states are important but dull. Properties such as Fn(x) (E}n' and (Llx)n are independent of time; so not even in a statistical sense does the \"motion\" of a microscopic oscillator in a stationary state resemble that of a macroscopic oscillator. But the behavior of a microscopic oscillator in a non-stationary state is far more interesting. To investigate the motion of a particle in such a state we must calculate the expectation values of position and momentum-which, because the state is non- stationary, tum out to depend on time.35 Example 9.6. A Periodic Wave Packet. Suppose the state of a system is represented by the normalized wave function (/3 2 ) 1/4 w(x,t) = ~-;- e-132x2/2 [e-iwot/2 + v'2/3xe-3iwot/2] . Pretty scary, right? Not actually. The presence of the Gaussian e-132x2/2 and factors of the form e-niwot/2 are clues that this function may be a simple combination of stationary-state wave functions wn(x,t) = 'I/1n(x)e- iEnt/\" . Sure enough, a few moments spent with the analytic forms in Table 9.6 will reveal that 1 W(x, t) = v'2 [Wo(x, t) + WI(x, tÂ») . (9. 129b) To be sure, this function does not represent a stationary state, for its dependence on space and time variables can't be separated. Question 9-32 Verify that Eqs. (9.129a) and (9.129b) are equivalent. Evaluating stat istical properties of the state is much easier if we work with the ex- pression for w(x, t) in terms of stationary-state wave functions, (9.129b), because we know these properties for stationary states (Table 9.9). For this reason, I'll also leave the forms of all equations as general as possible for as long into the derivation as possible. The expectation value of position at time t is (x) (t) = (w(x , t) I x I w(x, tÂ») =1:wÂ· (x, t)xw(x, t) dx . (9.130) (9.131a) Inserting (9.129b) but not explicitformsfor the eigenfunctions into this definition, we obtain (x) (t) = ~( ('1/10 I x I '1/10) + ('1/11 I x I '1/11) + ('1/10 I x I 'I/11)e-i wot + ('1/11 I x l'I/1o)e+i wot). The first two terms in (9.131a) are just (x)o and (x)l' and, accord ing to Table 9.9, these are zero. In the remaining terms are two matrix elements that, according to Table 9.7, are both equal to 1/.j2ii2. So the expectation value of posit ion for the non-stationary state (9.129) is simply (x) (t) = -2 1 ~ (e- i wot + e+i wot) = ~ cos wot. v 2/3 v 2/3 (9.13lb) 35We' ll iake up non-stationary states in their own right a few chapters from now (Chap. 12), so you can skip this extended example if you have to. 410 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II Now let's evaluate (P) (t) for this state, (P) (t) = H(P)o + (P)1 - iii ([: 1/J~(x)d~1/Jl (x) dX) e-i\"'ot - iii ([: 1/J~(x):X1/Jo(x) dX) e+i\"'ot] . (9.132a) Calling once again on Table 9.7, we can reduce the right-hand side of (9.1320) to (P) (t) = .!L( -iii) (e+i\"'ot _ e- i\"'0') = _ f31i sin wot. 2J2 J2 (9.132b) (9.133a)(x) (t) = So, written in terms of f3 = Jmwo/Ii, themeanvalues oftheposition and momentum of a simpleharmonic oscillator in the non-stationary state (9./29) are V2 Ii cos wot mwo v m woli .(p) (t) = - -2- sm wot. (9.133b) Well, this state is certainly non-stationary! In contrast to the stationary states in previous sections , this state is characterized by a position and momentum that, on the average, oscillate about zero with period 21r/ wo,just like the classical trajectory x(t) and p(t) of a macroscopic oscillator. But don't be fooled: this finding doesn 't pertain to all observables-as you 'll discover in the next Question. Question 9-33 Use the TISE it1/Jn(X) = En1/Jn(x) to show that the mean value of the energy for the state (9.130) is (E) = (w(x,t) I it I W(x,tÂ» = ~(Eo + Ed = liwo. (9.134) Hint: You will need to use the following property of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions, which we'll prove in the next chapter: 1 +00 -oc 1/J~(X)1/Jm(X)dx = 0 mi:n. (9.135) In the non-stationary state of this example, the uncertainties in position and momentum oscillate with the classical period To (see Pblm. 9.4). This is strange behavior for a wave packet-most of these critters spread; their widths increase without limit as time passes [see Â§ 6.7 and especially Fig. 6.4). But the motion of this packet looks something like this: according to Eq. (9.133a), it \"sloshes\" back and forth between the class ical turning points (i.e., its center undergoes simple harmonic motion at frequency wo). After one period, the packet has resumed its original shape! No spreading. To gain further insight into this strange behavior, consider the probability density for this state: P(x, t) = wÂ· (x , t)w(x, t) = ~[1/JI~(X)1/JO(x)+ 1/J~(X)1/Jl(X) +1/J~(X)1/Jl(x)e-i\"'\"' + 1/J~(x)1/Jo(x)e+i\"'o'] . (9.136a) (9. I36b) Sec. 9.10 The Incredible Sloshing Oscillator 411 The time-dependent terms in P(x, t) oscillate at the natural frequency woo So at the end of a period the probability density returns to the form it had at the beginning of the period. No spreading! A General Non-stationary State of the SHO We can easily generalize the arguments at the end of Example 9.6 to show that sloshing characterizes the motion of any wave packet of a simple harmonic oscillator. This gen- eralization is based on the expansion of the wave function for an arbitrary non-stationary state in Hamiltonian eigenfunctions . Any such function can be written (see Chap. 12) as a sum of stationary-state wave functions, with expansion coefficients I'll call dn ; i.e., 00 w(x, t) = L dn1/Jn(x)e- iEn tjn . n=O (9.137) It is imperative that the sum include all eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. The coeffi- cients dn depend on the initial condition W(x, 0). To see the sloshing of such a state, let's calculate the corresponding probability density: 00 oc P(x, t) = L L d;lIdn 1/J;lI(X)1/Jn(x)e-i(n-m)wot. m=On=O (9.138) Look at the time dependence of this function. Each term oscillates at frequency Wo or at an integral multiple of this frequency. So the probability density for an arbitrary state of the SHO is periodic: after a time 21f/ Wo , P(x , t) returns to its original form. Every non-stationary state of the SHO is therefore periodic. WARNING This time dependence is peculiar to states of the simple harmonic oscillator; sloshing be- havior with no long-term change in the width occurs for no other system. Aside: Sloshing of a Coherent State. A particularly interesting periodic wave packet that is widely used in applied fields such as quantum electronics and quantum optics is one that represents a \"coherent state\" of the SHOo This state evolves from the initial condition \\If(x , 0) = (~)1/4 e-1J2(x- xo)2/2 . (9.139) This function has the fonn of the simple Gaussian that describes the ground stationary state of the simple harmonic oscillator-cf, Example 9.3 [Eq. (9.104a)]-but differs from t/Jo(x) in that its center (x) (0) is displaced by an amount zo. The probability density for (9.139)-which we can obtain by expanding this function IIla Eq.

Evaluating the uncertainty ~x(t), we discover that the width of this particular wave packet is independent of time!

Used with permission.] Before leaving this section, I want to reiterate the approach we used to the derivation of the expectation values (x) (t) and (p) (t) in Example 9.6. Learn from this example! Fight the temptation-rife among novice quantum mechanics-to develop an explicit form for a state function before you carry out the required algebraic manipulations! You might get the right answer this way, but suffer far more pain than necessary. So remember Rule When manipulating the wave function for a non-stationary state, always work with its general form as long as possible. Avoid until the last minute inserting into this form explicit dependence of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions (or of operators) that appear in this form. *9.11 FINAL THOUGHTS-AND AN APPLICATION OF THE LINEAR POTENTIAL In Â§ 9.5 I mentioned several applications of the simple harmonic oscillator. But this is just one of many continuous one-dimensional potentials used in current research to model complicated interactions. The Schrodinger equations for most such potentials can Sec. 9.11 Final Thoughts-and an Application of the Linear Potential 413 be transformed into differential equations that are solved by special functions or that can be subdued by the method of power series-although particularly recalcitrant cases must be attacked via numerical integration (cf., the Selected Readings for Chap . 8). To close our study of continuous potentials (and, for the moment, of problem-solving tactics), let's take a brief look at another important continuous example, the linear potential V(x) <X x. I want to introduce this model in the context of a remarkable application from solid state physics . If an ordinary metal is exposed to a magnetic field of a few hundred Gauss directed parallel to its surface, as in Fig. 9.20a, the resulting potential energy supports bound states of the electrons in the metal near the surface.F The potential such an electron finds itself in can be accurately approximated by a linear form , We'll denote the distance into the metal by x and the magnetic induction of the applied field by B . The surface presents an infinite barrier to the electron (like the left wall of the infinite square well in Chap. 7), so our model is actually a half-infinite linear potential. For a magnetic field of strength B, the potential inside the metal is proportional to B and to a constant \"{ that depends on the particular solid under investigation, i.e.,38 V(x) = {\"{BX x > 0 00 x:::; 0 half-infinite linear potential. (9.141) This potential, which is sketched in Fig. 9.20b, supports an infinite number of bound stationary states, the first four of which are shown . It can be used to model the potentials experienced by an electron in many metals in their normal phases. For example, at temperatures greater than 1.2 K, the electrons in metallic aluminum find themselves in a potential very like Eq. (9.141) . (But at lower temperatures, this metal becomes a superconductor, and the model potential in Fig. 9.2Oc becomes more appropriate.) Aside: Magnetospectroscopy. In the laboratory, solid-state physicists probe the mysteries of surface electron states by a technique called resonant magnetospec- troscopy. The idea is simpler than the name: Microwave radiation of frequency W m is applied to the solid (in addition to the magnetic field B = Bey) . This radiation induces transitions between bound states in the potential (9.141), provided that the applied frequency is nearly equal to the separation between the levels. In practice, the applied frequency W m is fixed and the field strength B varied, changing the energy levels until their separation is close enough to liwm for a transition to be Iikely-a condition called resonance. The TISE for the linear potential (9.141) is [for x> 0 only) (9.142) The solutions of this equation that obey the boundary conditions imposed by the potential (9.141) are the bound-state eigenfunctions and energies, which I'll label by an index 37These states are sometimes called \"skipping states,\" because in such a state. a classical particle. acting under the influence of the magnetic force, would skip along the surface of the metal-l ike a flat rock on a still pond. Technically, these states are known as \"surface Landau levels.\" For more about these fascinating states and their physics see R. E. Doezema and J. F. Koch, Phys. Condo Matter, 19, 17 (1975) and M. Wanner, R. E. Doezema, and U. Strom, Phys. ReI'. B. 12,2883 (1975). 381nSI units, the magnetic field strength (in non-magnetic materials) is related to the magnetic induction by H = /loB , where /lO is the constant 411' x 10- 7 HIm. The magnitude of the corresponding (Lorentz) force on a particle of charge q and velocity v is F = qvB. From this force we obtain the potential (9.141). 414 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II Metal surface A Bit I I_.1 _ I I I I I I la) (b) Ionization limit V(x) ~ E3 --------.,,.----- x Ie) Figure 9.20 (a) The half-infinite linear model of the potential of an electron near the surface of a normal metal.

This potential supports a finite number of bound states whose energies lie below the limit indicated by the horizontal dashed line. Note that . the cont inuum state with energy E3 can tunnel through the barrier (see Chap. 8). [For a discussion of this potential. see R. E. Doezema, S. C. Whitmore. and J. N. Huffaker. Phys. Rev.

(9.142), let's apply our knowledge of qualitative quantum physics to sketch a couple of the bound-state eigenfunctions. It turns out that we can deduce quite a lot about these functions without much labor: 1. Since the potential is not symmetric, its eigenfunctions don't have definite parity . 2. This potential depends on z, so the classical turning points depend on the energy. The classical turning point X n for the nth stationary state is (see Fig. 9.20b) E n X n = - . n = 1,2,... (9.144) IB These points are critical: they delimit the classically allowed and classically for- bidden regions and thus are instrumental in our determination of the nature of the eigenfunctions, as CA region 0:::; x :::; Xn: tPn(X) oscillatory CF region Xn < x < 00: tPn(x) monotonically decaying 3. The amplitude of each eigenfunction changes with x : as x increases from 0, the quantity lEn - V(x)1 decreases, so the amplitude of tPn(x) increases [see Eq. (9.21)]. 4. The wavelengths and decay constants of two spatial functions, say tPl (x) and tP2(X), reflect the x dependence of the potential. The wavelength for tP2(X) is smaller than that for tPl(X), as is the local decay constant. Therefore, tP2(X) oscillates more rapidly for x :::; X n and decays to zero more slowly for x > X n (i.e., is more penetrating) than does tPl (x). 5. The function tPn(x) has n - 1 nodes. Putting these facts together, we can draw the qualitatively correct eigenfunction sketches in Fig. 9.21. V!,(X) Xl X x Figure 9.21 Sketches of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions for the first two bound sta- tionary states of the half-infinite linear potential (9.141). The vertical dashed lines are the classical turning points X n that separate the CA and CF regions. Question 9-34 Extend these arguments and sketch '1/JJ(x) and t/14(X). Question 9-35 Compare qualitatively the energy of the ground state of the linear potential in Fig. 9.20b with that of an infinite square well of width L = Xt: is the energy of the linear potential greater than, less than, or equal to that of the infinite well? Also answer this question for the first excited state, using an infinite well of width L = X 2 . 416 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II I Will Fear No Airy Functions But enough of such frivolity . How do we solve the TISE (9.142)? We could do so numerically'? or we could transform it into a form that has already been solved by someone else. I prefer the latter approach. The necessary transformation involves introducing a potential strength parameter, an energy variable, and a dimensionless length-just the sorts of tricks we played on the TISE for the simple harmonic oscillator in Â§ 9.7 (see Table 9.2). First we must isolate the second derivative in the first term of (9.142) ; viz., [ d2 2m 2mE] dx2 - t;2,Bx + 7 1/JE(X) = O. (9.145) To clean up (9.145), let's introduce the following intermediate quantities (cf., Table 9.3): energy variable. potential strength parameter 2m {3 =t;2B, 2m f=t;2E In this garb, the TISE looks like (f:x2 - (3x+ f) 1/JE(X) = O. (9.1400) (9. 146b) (9.147) According to our game plan (ct, Table 9.3), the next step is to introduce a di- mensionless variable f . Following the example of the simple harmonic oscillator, you might try ~ = (3x. Reasonable this choice is; successful it is not. After trying several reformulations of Eq. (9.147), one discovers that to reduce it to a form whose solution is known, we must change the independent variable from x to the energy-dependent variable ( 2m, B) 1/3 where c ss -r (9.148) With this definition Eq. (9.147) becomes the light and frothy Airy equation (9.149) This equation is called the Airy equation, after the man who solved it.40 We want only solutions of (9.149) that satisfy the boundary conditions (9.143). So we must express these conditions in terms of~. Applying the change of variable x - ~, we find that the condition (9.143a) must be imposed on 1/Jf(~) at ~ = -aE/bB). The 39See R. D. Desko and D. J. Bord, Amer. Jour. Phys.â€¢ 51.82 (1983). 40Their discoverer was the English astronomer and mathematician G. B. Airy (1801-1892). Airy is better known for his work as the Astronomer Royal. as the organizer of several completely unsuccessful expeditions to study the transit of Venus in 1874 and 1882. and as an egotistical . ruthless. and much disliked astronomer . He did not. of course, introduce Airy functions in the context of quantum physics, which did not exist when he published their details (1838). Rather. he was studying rainbows. See H. M. Nussenzweig, Sci. Amer.â€¢ 236. 116 (1977). Sec. 9.11 Final Thoughts-and an Application of the Linear Potential 417 (9.150b) (9.1500) second condition is a limit, so it does not change when the variable does . We obtain the boundary conditionsr'! ~t(~=-~~)=0 ~e(~) I O. e-+oo The two linearly-independent solutions of Eq. (9.149) are called the Airy functions. They are denoted by the odd notation Ai(~) and Bi(~). (The symbol i is not A; it is part of the name of the function .) Graphs of selected Airy functions appear in Fig. 9.22. Each Airy function oscillates, crossing the horizontal axis at several (discrete) values of the argument F, These special values of ~, which occur only for negative values of ~, are called the zeroes of the Airy function. I'll denote the zeroes of Ai(~) by ~n for n= 1, 2, .. . . -0.6 Figure 9.22 The Airy functions Ai({) and Bi({). [Adapted from Figs. 10.6 and 10.7 of Handbook of Mathematical Functions. ed. by M. Abramowitz and I. A. Stegun (New York: Dover. 1965).] Using the two Airy functions, we can construct the general solution of the TISE for a linear potential. With arbitrary coefficients C and D, we have ~t(~) = C Ai(~)+ D Bi(~). (9.15Ia) The trouble with this form is that Bi(~) blows up as ~ -+ 00 , which eruption violates the boundary condition (9.150b) . So we must set D = 0, leaving behind the physically admissible eigenfunction ~t(~) = C Ai(~). (9.15Ib) 41The half-infinite linear potential (9.141) admits a non-zero Hamiltonian eigenfunction only for x> O. But the transformation to the variable { is such that { = 0 at the classical turning point x\" = En/(;B) . So the CA region includes negative values of {; this region is -aE/(;B) :5 { :5 o. 418 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II We can determine the coefficient C by enforcing the normalization condition, which for this eigenfunction reads oc ~ J 'l/J:(~)'l/JE(~)dÂ£.= 1. (9.152) -aE/(-yB) As usual, I'll bypass this tedious normalization. We took care of the boundary condition at infinity, (9.150b), by setting D = 0 in the general form (9.15Ia). But physically admissible eigenfunctions must also satisfy the condition at the left wall of the potential, Eq. (9.150a) . As you might expect, this condition quantizes the bound-state energies. Watch. The only way the function (9.15Ib) can obey the boundary condition (9.150a) is if (9.153) That is, the Airy function in the eigenfunction must have a zero at ~ = -aej(-yB). But we can't control where the zeroes of Ai(~) occur (see Fig. 9.22); the only way we can enforce this requirement is to choose the energy in ~ so that Eq. (9.153) is satisfied . This tactic becomes clear if we write explicitly the relationship between the nodes of the Airy function at ~lo 6, ... and the stationary-state energies En, allowed energies of the linear potential. (9.154) The zeroes in Table 9.10 should help you determine the bound-state energies for any system that can be modeled by a half-infinite linear potential. You'll have a chance to try this out in the impending problems.

Quarks are currently thought to be the fundamental building blocks of protons, neutrons, . . . , indeed. of matter itself. Theoretical physicists have speculated that the interaction between two quarks may be a constant force, for the strong binding provided by such a force would explain the curious fact that isolated quarks have never been seen. And a constant force means a linear potential.v' So don't let anyone tell you that continuous one-dimensional potentials are useful only to students of undergraduate quantum physics .

(9.5.3) (9.5.4) Problems 9.1 Comparison of a Piecewise-Constant and a Continuous Potential We spent most of Part III working with the symmetric finite square well [of height Vo and width L (with its midpoint at x = 0)) and the simple harmonic oscillator [of natural frequency wo). Consider the ground-state eigenfunctions of these two potentials: 'I/J~w(x) and 'l/JgHO(x) . Choose the parameters of the well (VO and L) and of the SHO (wo) so that the following criteria are satisfied: I. The classical turning points occur at the same values of x. 2. The local wave number at t = 0 of the piece of 'I/J~HO(x) in the CA region is equal to the wave number of the corresponding piece of 'I/J~w(x). 3. The local decay constant of the pieces of 'l/JgHO(X) in the CF regions are equal at the classical turning points to the decay constant of the corresponding pieces of 'I/J~w(x).

Suppose, instead, that we try to model this system by a finite symmetric square well of width L and depth V(}. Determine values of these parameters so that the following conditions are fulfilled: I. The ground-state energies of these systems (Eo for the SHO and E 1 for the well) are equal. 2. The well supports five bound states.

(9.5.3)? 9.6 Semiconductor Quantum Physics A very thin sample of the semiconductor PbTe (lead telluride) of width L is exposed to a uniform electric field t normal to the surface . The potential energy of an electron near the surface of the sample can be modeled by the one-dimensional potential -00 < x $ 0 O<x<L L$x<oo (9.6.1) (This potential is just an infinite square well with a ramp for a floor.) We can control the width of the sample L in the process of growing it. [a] Write down the general solution of the TISE for this system, introducing two arbitrary constants C and D . [bl Now impose the boundary conditions appropriate to this potential and thereby transform the TISE into a set of two linearhomogeneous algebraic equations for C and D.

This factor vanishes when we take the limit, after integration.) [a] Prove that the integral in Eq. (9.8.1) satisfies the Airy equation (9.149). [bl By examining the behavior of the integrand in Eq. (9.8.1) for large values of the variable ~, explain why Ai(~) goes to zero in the limit ~ -> 00 . This limit, you will (I hope) recall, is vital to ensuring that an eigenfunction involving an Airy function satisfies the boundary conditions for physical admissibility. [c] Show that the asymptotic limit of the Airy function is (9.8.2) [d] Using Eq. (9.8.2), compare the behavior in the classically forbidden regions of the ground-state eigenfunctions of the half-infinite linear potential and of a simple harmonic oscillator. In particular, decide if the eigenfunction for the ground state of the linear potential decays to zero with increasing ~ faster. slower, or at the same rate as the ground-state eigenfunction of the SHOo Also compare the rate of decay of the ground- state eigenfunction of the linear potential to that of the corresponding function for a finite, symmetric square well. [e] The other asymptotic limit is ~ -> -00. In this limit, the Airy function reduces to the form (9.8.3) Use this form to determine approximate zeroes of the Airy function ~1t for n = 3, 4, and 5. Compare your answers to the exact zeroes in Table 9.10. Exercises and Problems 427 9.9 Bending Vibrations of Methylene The SHO is a useful model for studying the vibrations of a diatomic molecule (see Â§ 9.6). But more complicated systems call for more complicated models. Consider, for example, the methylene molecule CH2 â€¢ In its ground electronic state, this system is bent; the angle between the two C-H bonds is about 1340 â€¢ The vibrations of this molecule are bending vibrations and are described as functions of this angle, which we'll denote by fJ. (Other kinds of vibrations involving stretching of the C-H bonds also occur. In this problem, however, we'll keep these bonds fixed at their equilibrium values.) A graph of this potential, shown in Fig. 9.9.1,45 looks like a parabola with a hump in the middle. Also shown on this figure-and tabulated in Table 9.9.1-are the first seven stationary-state energies, as determined by recent, highly accurate, spectroscopic studies.\" VIO) 10 E7 E6 Es 5 E4 1340 180 0 314 0 e Figure 9.9.1 To study these vibrations quantum-mechanically, we must devise a model of this potential. We'll express this model in terms of the variable x == fJ - fJc , i.e., the displacement of the bending angle from equilibrium. Obviously, the simple SHO potential V(x) = tmw~x2 won't do.

(2) Analysis of spectroscopic data for methylene reveals that the minima in the potential of the ground electronic state occur at 8e = 134 0 and at 8e = 314 0 and that the top of the bump is roughly O.2eV above these minima.

[c) \"Double-hump\" potentials can be used in a variety of molecular problems, such as the buckling motion of ring compounds in organic chemistry, and the inversion of the ammonia molecule in laser physics. In some of these applications , the minima are much deeper (compared to the hump) than in methylene . If this is the case-and if we're interested only in low-lying vibrational states-we may be able to get a (very) rough approximation to the energy levels by assuming the hump to be very large. Consider this limit and expand the model potential Eq. (9.9.2) in a Taylor series about equilibrium , dropping all terms above the quadratic . Derive an expression for the energy levels for the left and right wells in this model. 9.10 A Qualitative Solution of a TISE Consider a particle of mass m with potential V(x) = clz], (9.10.1) where c is a real, positive constant (see Fig. 9.10.1).

On your sketch of PlO(X), also show the probability density that classical physics would predict for a panicle with this potential energy. Remark: This problem is yet another example of the Correspondence Principle-<juantum behavior becoming classical behavior in the appropriate limit. 9.11 Hermite Polynomials: A Capsule Introduction to Their Properties In our study of the simple harmonic oscillator, we encountered our first (but not last) special function : the Hermite polynomials of degree n , Hn(f~). From now on-in this course and in other physics, math and engineering courses-you'll be using special functions, many of which are more complicated than Hermite polynomials. The care and feeding of these functions is facilitated by the fact that they all share similar properties and satisfy similar relationships. In this problem, we'll develop the most important of these properties and relationships for the Hermite polynomials. The Hermite polynomial of order n is defined as (9.11.1) The origin of this polynomial is, surprisingly, buried in an interesting property of Gaussians. Recall (from Chap . 4) that, in its simplest form, a Gaussian function has the mathematical form (9.1 1.2) The property to which I'm referring concerns the nth derivative of !(~). This derivative is proportional to a polynomial of degree n, to wit: :;n!(~) = (-It (nth order polynomial) !(e). (9.11.3) [al Verify Eq. (9.11.3) for n = 0, I, and 2. Show that polynomials in this equation for these values of n are indeed the Hermite polynomials of degree 0, I, and 2. Using Eq. (9.11.1), derive H3(~). As the last question in pan [a] shows , the definition Eq. (9.11.1) is not a particularly convenient way to determine Hermite polynomials. One alternative is to use a recurrence relation. A recurrence relation is an equation that relates the desired special function of order n to functions of lower order and, sometimes, to their derivatives. [bl From the definition Eq. (9.1 I.1), derive the recurrence relation 430 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.11.4) One of the most important relatives of a special function is its \"generating function.\" The generating function generates the desired special function via a Taylor seriesexpansion. For example, a Taylor Series expansion of (9.11.5) in the variable A about A = 0 \"generates\" the Hermite polynomials according to the following equation: 00 An g(A) = L ,H1t(~).n. n=O (9.11.6) [c] Derive Eq. (9.11.6). Hint: One way to do this is to first consider the Taylor series expansion about A = 0 of the function (9.11.7) (9.11.9) (9.11.8) (9.Il.lO) Then use Eq. (9.1l.l). You may well be wondering what earthly good Eq. (9.11.6) is. Surely it isn 't likely to help us derive explicit expressions for Hermite polynomials. True enough. But this equation can be used to easily obtain some very useful recurrence relations. [d] Use Eq. (9.11.6) to derive the following results: d d1,Hn(~) = 2nHn-l(~) H1t(~) = 2~Hn-l(~) - 2(n - I)Hn-2(~)' Hint: Differentiate Eq. (9.11.6) with respect to A and ~. Then equate like powers of A. [e] Use Eq. (9.11.9) to derive n, from tt, and H7. [f] Use Eq. (9.11.8) to derive the differential equation satisfied by H1t(~), [:2 -2~~+2n] Hn(O = O. [g] Prove that the parity of Hn(~) is (_I)n . 9.12 Another \"Truncated\" SUO An unrealistic feature of the SHO potential is that it increases without limit to infinity . To improve on this model, we might try truncating this potential as shown in Fig. 9.12 .1, i.e.â€¢ with VI and V2 as positive constants, -00 < x $-a -a < x < b b$x<oo (9.12 .1) Rather than solve the TISE for this potential (no trivial matter!) let's explore some of qualitative features of eigenfunctions. -a o b Figure 9.12.1 Exercises and Problems 431 [a] Consider four ranges of energy: Range A : Range B : Range C : Range D : E> VI V2<E<VI 0<E<V2 E<O For each range of energy, answer the following questions : (I) What is the nature of the eigenfunction (i .e., oscillatory or monoton ic) throughout space (-00 < x < oo)? (Be sure to distinguish different regions, where appropri- ate.) (2) Is the energy spectrum quantized or continuous? (3) Are the stationary states degenerate? (4) Are the stationary states bound or continuous? [b] Now for Range C: 0 < E < V2 only, do the following: (I) Write down the TISE in each region of x . (2) Write down the boundary and cont inuity conditions on \"l/JE(X) in terms of the pieces of this function in each region from [b.I]. Compare the number of boundary condi- tions with the number of unknowns in the general solution of the TISE [keep in mind the fact that this (second-order) differential equation has two linearly-independent solutions in each region]. Do you have sufficient flexibility to normalize the eigen- functions? (3) Consider the ground state, which we'll label with n = O. Is this energy greater or less than Tiwo/2? Justify your answer. Now, sketch \"l/Jo(x) and, on the same figure, the ground-state eigenfunction for a SHO [which is obtained from Eq. (9.12.1) by letting a -> 00 and b -> 00] . (Feel free to wildly exaggerate the differences between these functions, for clarity's sake.) [c] Consider now the symmetric truncated well obtained from Eq. (9. 12.1) by setting b = a. As in [b], we'll consider energy range C: 0 < E < V2 only. (I) Do the eigenfunctions of this potential have definite parity? Why or why not? How many nodes does \"l/Jo(x) have? What is the symmetry of this function? (2) In designing a model potential by truncating the SHO, is there any advantage to truncating so as to give a symmetric potential? Hint: Review your answers to question [b.2]. Think about imposing the boundary conditions. (3) Suppose the wave-function fairy gave you the analytic form of the ground-state spatial function \"l/Jo(x) and told you to calculate the average value of x for this state. What value would you get? Would you expect the same answer if b < a (the asymmetric potential)? If so, explain why. If not, would you expect (x)o to be greater or less than its value for b = a? 9.13 An Application of the SUO to Molecular Vibrations Small-amplitude vibrations of a diatomic molecule can be studied using as a model of the true molecular vibrational potential the simple harmonic oscillator potential 1 2 V(x) = \"2kfX , (9.13.1) where kf is the force constant. For a typical diatomic molecule, the force constant is roughly kf = 1.0 X 10 3 J_m- 2 (see Table 9.1). [a] Using this value, estimate the value of the zero-point vibrational energy of a diatomic molecule (in eV). [b] Estimate the energy spacing (in eV) between the ground vibrational state and the first excited vibrational state of the molecule. 432 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.15 .1) (9.15.2) Ic] Suppose the molecule undergoes a transition from the first excited vibrational slate to the ground state , emitting a photon in the process. Estimate the energy, the frequency, and the wavelength of the emitted photon . Compare your result with the classical oscillation frequency of this system. In what range of the electromagnetic spectrum is this photon found? 9.14 Quantum Oscillations in the Sky? If you were on an airplane, staring out the window, you might notice the disquieting fact that the wings of the plane oscillate. Careful observation shows that the period of these oscillations is typically on the order of 1 sec and the amplitude is typically about 0.1 m. (If the amplitude is much greater, the plane will crash and you needn't worry about solving this problem.) la] Demonstrate that these oscillations could not be due to the quantum-mechanical zero point motion of the wings. [b) What is the quantum number n of the observed oscillations? Ic] Suggest an alternative explanation for this phenomenon. 9.15 A One-dimensional \"Hydrogen Atom\" One of the first \"real systems\" we'll study in Volume II is the one-electron atom, the paradigm of which is the hydrogen atom. The potential energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom (in MKS units) is e2 V(r) = - 47l\"â‚¬or ' where e is the charge on the electron and r is the distance of the electron from the proton . The hydrogen atom is, of course, a three-dimensional system, and r is the radial coordinate of a spherical coordinate system with the origin at the proton. But we need not wait until the next volume to get a feeling for the physics of the hydrogen atom . We can model this system by a simple, continuous one-dimensional potential energy whose Schrodinger Equation we can solve . The first question is, how to devise such a model. Our first thought might be to try a potential energy of the form e2 V(x) - --- - 47l\"â‚¬olxl' where we use [z] to ensure that the spatial coordinate of the electron does not assume negative values . [Recall that r in Eq. (9.15.1) is defined on the domain from 0 to 00.] The TISE for this potential can be solved, but doing so is mathematically quite difficult, because the potential Eq. (9.15.2) has a pole at the origin. And there is another problem with this model : since r is defined to be non-negative, spatial functions for the hydrogen atom must be zero for x < O. But this potential does not guarantee that the corresponding bound-state spatial functions will be zero for x < O. These considerations motivate us to conjure a simpler one-dimensional model of a hy- drogen atom, V(x) = x>O x~O (9.15.3) We can determine the bound stationary-state energ ies of an electron with this potential by applying the method of power series that we studied in Â§ 9.7. Let's go through the solution together, step-by-step. [a] Simplify the TISE for total energy E by changing the variable of differentiation from x to one that is dimensionless. Define this new variable ~ in terms of the constant 47l\"â‚¬o1i? ao == -- 2-' (9.15.4) m~e Exercises and Problems 433 (9.15.5) which is the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom (see Appendix B). Introduce a dimen- sionless energy parameter e defined by -2 2meEa~ f =--......\"..~ \",2 ' and the dimens ionless length variable { {= 2x . fao (9.15.6) Notice that the energy E necessarily appears in the length variable . Remark : The differential equation that results from this change of variable, which is called Kummer's equation, can be solved using confluent hypergeometric Wittaker functions .V However , we'll just plow on ahead as though we don 't know this. [b] The equation you have just derived cannot immediately be solved by, for example, inserting into it a power series expansion of tPE({). First, we must examine its asymptotic solution. Consider your equation in the limit I{I -> 00 and determine the asymptotic behavior of tPE({). (Don't forget to take steps to ensure that this spatial function remains physically admissible in this limit.) [c] We now introduce a new unknown function f({) that is defined so the spatial function has the form of f({) times a function that describes the asymptotic dependence of tPE on {. Derive the equation that f({) must satisfy . [d] Your equation from part [c] can be solved by a power series, viz., 00 f({) = LCje, j = O (9.15.7) (9.16.1) in which we must set Co = O. (Why?) Derive a recurrence relation for the coefficients Cj in this series . [e] Give an argument to show that the infinite series Eq. (9.15.7) must be truncated at some finite order, and show that doing so leads to the restriction that f must equal a positive integer. [f] From the result to part [e], obtain an expression for the allowed energies of the bound states of this model hydrogen atom. Look up the equation for the bound-state energies of an actual, three-dimensional hydrogen atom and compare your result to this answer. Is Eq. (9.15.3) a good model for determining the energies of this system? Can you think of any important physical effects that have been totally ignored in this model? [g] Using the recurrence relation of part [d] write down unnonnalized spatial functions for the first three bound states of this model potential energy. 9.16 The SUO in Momentum Space In Chap . 4 we explored the momentum probability amplitude for a quantum state . This func- tion, <I>(p), is the Fourier transform of the initial wave function in the position representation, \\l!(x,O), i.e., <I>(p) = ~1Â°O \\l!(x,O)e- i px / h dx. v 21r'\" -00 If the system is in the nth stationary state, then \\l!(x,O) = tPn(X) , and this relationship becomes <I>n(P) = ~ 1 00 tPn(x)e- i px / h dx. v 21r'\" -00 [nth stationary state] (9.16.2) 47See A Course in Modern Analysis by Wittaker and Watson (Cambridge University Press. 1969), p. 377 ff . 434 Chap. 9 States of a Particle in One Dimension II (9.16.3)[nth stationary state] In this case, the inverse transform relation is tPn(X) = ~ 1 00 4>n(p)eipx/ h dp. v21rn -00 Use these relationships to transform the TISE for the SHO into momentum space . To do this, substitute Eq. (9.16.3) into the TISE and derive an equation for the momentum probability amplitude 4>n(P). Express your equation in terms of the variables in Table 9.3. Now, solve your equation for 4>n(P) for the SHOo Remark: The simple harmonic oscillator is one of the few systems (other than the free particle) for which the momentum-space Schrodinger Equat ion is easily solved. When the Schrodinger equations of most systems are transformed into momentum space, integral terms appear that render their solution difficult mathematically. 9.17 The Linear Potential in Momentum Space In Â§ 4.6 we explored the momentum representation of a quantum state. The expressions relating the momentum probability amplitude 4>(p) to the wave function in the position rep- resentation are given in Fig. 4.12 . In Â§ 5.8 we learned how to express x and p in this representation [Eq. (5.90)] and how to use these forms to evaluate expectation values . [a] Show that in the momentum representation the TISE for the nth stationary state of the half-infinite linear potential (9.141) is (:: + i-yB ;p ) 4>n(P) = E4>n(P) . [b] Integrate Eq. (9.17 .1), obtaining 4>n(P) = 4>(0)e-iP(E-p2/6m)/hBh). (9.17 .1) (9.17.2) (9.17.3) [c] Now use the Fourier transform relationships to transform Eq. (9.17.2) into the position representation, thereby regaining the Hamiltonian eigenfunction tPn(X) of Â§ 9.11. With little difficulty, you should obtain the follow ing integral: tPn(X) = {Â£4>(O)1 00 cos [ 6~~B+ P (x - ~)] dp. (9.17.4) You can show that this is equivalent to (9.151) (to within an overall multiplicative normalization constant) by using the handy Airy relation Ai [Â±(ea)-1/2x] = ~1 00 cos (a p3 Â± xp) dp. v3a 0 Granted, this is not as easy a way to solve the TISE as the method of Â§ 9.11, but it is an interesting alternative that sheds more light on the connection between the position and momentum representations of a quantum state.

Ford - In Part III we solved several simple one-dimensional problems using the fundamental elements of quantum mechanics-wave functions and operators-and Postulates I-IV, which assert the existence of these elements and tell us how to interpret them. But our ultimate goal is understanding the (more complicated) systems of the microworld: atoms , molecules , solids , nuclei. Our ability to solve these systems and to extract the maximum amount of physical information from their state functions depends on our mastery of the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics . So in Part IV we're going to shift gears again. In the next four chapters, it's back to basics for an intimate look at the elements of quantum physics-operators in this chapter and the next, wave functions in Chap . 12. Then, in Chap. 13, we'll discover how these abstract mathematical constructs describe what goes on in the real world of laboratory measurements. Paradoxically, these chapters involve less algebra but more mathematics than those in Part III.1 And, because this mathematics is at times rather abstract , the relevance of some of the topics I'll introduce may seem a tad remote. Trust me. All will become clear. In this chapter we concentrate on operators, mathematical instructions that, in quantum physics , represent quantities we can measure in the laboratory. My goal in Chaps. 10 and II is to help you become familiar with operators , their mathematical properties, and the implications of these properties for the physics of microscopic sys- tems. To this end, we'll first supplement our grab-bag of mathematical properties of operators (from Chap. 5) in Â§ 10.1-10.4. Then, in Â§ 10.5-10.8, we will focus on a particular type of operator equation-the eigenvalue equation-and will there discover a remarkable and beautiful example of the subtle interweaving of mathematics and physics that characterizes quantum theory. This background will prepare us to tum, in Chap. II, to the consequences of the properties of operators for the physics of uncertainty relations, conservation laws, and constants of the motion. 10.1 OPERATORS IN REVIEW: A CAPSULE SUMMARY OF CHAPTERS Cast your mind back to Chap. 5. There we learned quantum physicists represent observ- abies via mathematical instructions called operators. This essential idea was succinctly stated in The Third Postulate of Quantum Mechanics (Â§ 5.4), which bears repeating: IThe reason is that the character istic manipulations in the branch of mathematics underlying this ma- terial. linear algebra. are far easier than those of the theory of differential equations . We won't study linear algebra per se; 1 have resolutely resisted the temptation to show you the mathematics of quantum mechanics in all its (considerable) glory. Still, you should be aware that this theory can be described with a high degree of mathematical rigor. For an overview of this description. see Chap. 8 of Quantum Mechanics, 2nd ed, by Eugen Merzbacher (New York: Wiley. 1980). More advanced discussions can be found in Foundations of Quantum Mechanics by J. M. Jauch (Reading , Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1968) and in Mathematical Methods of Quantum Mechanics by G. Fano (New York: McGraw-Hili. 1971). Sec. 10.1 Operators in Review: A Capsule Summary of Chapter 5 437 Postulale Ill: In quantum mechanics. every observable is represented by an operator that is used to obtain physical information about the observable from state functions . For an observable that in classical physics is represented by the function Q(x,p). the corresponding operator is Q(x,p). In Chap. 5 we also learned how to construct quantum-mechanical operators in the position and momentum representations , starting from the operators for x and p (see Table 10.1). Nearly all operators in quantum mechanics derive from observables that can be expressed as functions of x and p. For such a classical function Q(x,p). we can design an explicit operator Q = Q(x,p) by inserting the instructions for x and p (in the appropriate representation) into Q(x,p) . Thus, all operators can be considered functions of the elemental operators x and p. A compendium of the operators we have used so far appears in Table 10.2.2 TABLE 10.1 FORMS OF THE POSITION AND MOMENTUM OPERATORS IN THE POSITION AND MOMENTUM REPRESENTATIONS. Fundamental Operator Position Representation Momentum Representation x 'Ii ax +z - ap p 'Ii a-z - p ax Reference Eq. (5.89) Eq. (5.90) The Algebra of Operators When manipulating operators, we must obey their algebra : the collection of rules that describes how arbitrary operators act on functions and on each other. Particularly im- portant are the similarities and (especially) the differences between the rules for numbers and functions and those for operators . The definitions of the sum and difference of two operators ,At and ,A2 (acting on an arbitrary function f) look just like the definition of the sum and difference of two numbers or two functions: (lO.la) But, unlike numbers and functions. operators do not necessarily commute. Recall that two operators ,At and ,A2 commute if for any function f . the function ,At,A2f is equal to ,A2,A1I. This equality does not hold for two arbitrary operators, so we say \"the algebra of operators is not commutative,\" i.e., non-commutativity (lO.lb) 2For a detailed look at the construction of quantum-mechanical operators. see J. R. Shewell. Amer. Jour. Phys.â€¢ 27. 16 (1959). 438 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I TABLE 10.2 QUANTUM-MECHANICAL OPERATORS (IN THE POSITION REPRESENTATION). Observable Operator Instructions position x multiply by x momentum p '/i o-t - &x kinetic energy T /i2 &2 - 2m &x2 potential energy V multiply by Vex, t) Hamilton ian it /i2 &2 ---+V(x,t) 2m &x2 t '/i &energy t - &t We have seen, however, that there exist particular pairs of operators that do com- mute, such as p and T. These examples do not contradict the general non-commutativity rule (lO.lb), for this rule merely states that not all pairs of operators commute. Clearly, whether or not two operators commute depends on the particular operators we are talking about. Commutativity is so important a property that quantum mechanics have introduced a special operator called the commutator to express it. The commutator of two operators 01 and 02 is defined as3 commutator. (lO.2a) In terms of the commutator, the general non-commutativity of arbitrary quantum-mechan- ical operators is written (1O.2b) Of course, the commutator of two operators that do commute equals zero (see Table 10.3). In Chap. 11 we'll investigate the commutativity-or lack of same-for various operators and the remarkable consequences of this property for measurement of the observables they represent. The Role of Operators Operators and their commutators play central roles in quantum physics. The key to eval- uating a statistical property of an observable, such as its expectation value or uncertainty, 31n this chapter I will use a slightly different notational convention than in Chap. 5, for now it is crucial to distinguish properties of an arbitrary operator from properties that pertain only to operators in quantum mechanics-i.e., to \"Hermitian\" operators (see Â§ 10.3). Throughout the rest of this book, I will use A. B.6, .. . for an arbitrary operator and Q. Ii, s.... for a quantum-mechanical (Hermitian) operator. For example , because the commutator is always discussed for Hermitian operators . I have written Eq. (10.2) in tenns of Q. not A. Sec. 10.1 Operators in Review : A Capsule Summary of Chapter 5 439 (lO.3a) TABLE 10.3 COMMUTING AND NON-COMMUTING OPERATORS. QIQ2 =Q2Ql Ql and Q2 commute Example: p and T QIQ2 =F Q2Ql Ql and Q2 don't commute Example: p and x is the operator that represents the observable (cj., Â§ 9,9 and 9.10). For example, the expectation value at time t of an observable Q for a state '11(x, t) of a one-dimensional system is (Q) (t) = I: '11*(x, t)QW(x, t) dx. For a three dimensional system, Eq. (1O.3b) becomes the three-dimensional integral (Q) (t) = J W*(x,y, z, t)QW(x, y, z,t) dxdydz . all space (lO .3b) In Â§10.2, I'll introduce a general shorthand for the expectation value that subsumes one- and three-dimensional systems. In this \"Dirac notation,\" the expectation value of Q looks like (Q) (t) = ('11 IQI '11). (lO.3c) Operators also appear in the fundamental laws of quantum theory, e.g., the time- dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE), which describes the evolution of a quantum state, is the operator equation (lOAa) We shall see in Chap. 11 that operators also play a role in the laws that describe the evolution of a physical property, such as position, and that these laws bear a remarkable resemblance to those of Newton's classical mechanics , Finally, operators define their eigenvalues via eigenvalue equations, For example, if the state represented by '11 in the TDSE (lOAa) is stationary, then the state function has the special form '11 = 1/JEe- i E t/ h, and this equation reduces to the time-independent Schrodinger equation (TISE), (lOAb) As noted in Chap. 7, the TISE exemplifies an important class of equations called eigen- value equations: 1/JE is the eigenfunction of the operator if. with eigenvalue E . All operators have eigenvalue equations, and the study of these equations reveals physical conclusions of remarkable generality-statements, for example, that limit our knowledge of the microworld. By studying operators we can probe the mysteries of this world. 10.2 MORE MATHEMATICS OF QUANTUM-MECHANICAL OPERATORS To flesh out the skeleton of operator algebra we just reviewed, I want to show you a couple of additional features. First we'll discuss linearity, an important mathematical property of (nearly all) operators in quantum mechanics. We'll also find out how to 440 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I manipulate functions and derivatives of operators and, last but not least, will learn a simplified notation that will save fingers and pencils as we venture deeper into the formalism of quantum physics . Linearity (Superposition in a Mathematical Guise) In Chap. 6 we related the principle of superposition to the TDSE . In particular, we showed that if WI and W2 are (distinct) state functions of a system with Hamiltonian ii, then for arbitrary constants CI and C2, the linear combination CIW I + C2W2 satisfies the TDSE : (10.5) Hence this arbitrary linear combination represents a quantum state of the system . Phys- ically speaking, this is the principle of superposition. Mathematically speaking, it is a manifestation of the linearity of the operator ii- t. Nearly all operators in quantum mechanics are linear. The definition of linearity is simplicity itself: if !t and h are arbitrary functions and Cl and C2 arbitrary complex constants , then the operator Q is linear if Notice that this definition is really two properties in one: Q(!t+h)=Q!t+Qh Qcf = cQf. linearity (10.6) (10.7a) (l0.7b) It is easy to verify the linearity or lack of same of a particular operator, as is illustrated by the following little examples. Example 10.1. Linearity of the Linear Momentum Operator When we operate on Cl!l (x)+c2h(x) with p = -iTid/dx, the constants slide right through the first derivative. unchanged. And, since differentiation is distributive, we conclude i.e., the operator p is linear. Question 19-1 Prove linearity of p in the momentumrepresentation by operating with the explicit form of this operator (see Table 10.1) on an arbitrary linear combination of two momentum-space functions 91(P) and 92(p). Aside: Anti-linear operators. Lack of linearity does not necessarily imply that an operator is useless in quantum mechanics; \" anti-linear\" operators playa role in some branches of our field. An anti-linear operator is one that satisfies the properties Q(!l+h)=Q!l+Qh Qct = Â«os. (1O.9a) (lO.9b) Sec. 10.2 More Mathematics of Quantum-Mechanical Operators 441 The operator in Example 10.2 is anti-linear, as is the time-reversal operator, which is important in collision theory .\" We will not, however, have occasion to use anti-linear operators in this book. By the way, an operator that is neither linear nor anti-linear is called, sensibly, a \"non-linear operator .\" Example 10.2. An Anti-linear Operator Consider the operator that forms the complex conjugate of its operatee: Af=J*. This operator satisfies the first condition of linearity, Eq. (1O.7a), because But it fails the second test, because Acf = c' J* i= c]\": (lO .lO) (1O.lla) (lO.llb) Notice that we cannot salvage this operator by requiring c to be real; the condition (10.7b) must hold for a complex constant. Question 16-2 Consider the operator A that creates the square of the function on which it operates, Af(x) = l(x). Is this operator linear, anti-linear, or neither? Prove your answer by showing which, if any, of the conditions (10.7) or (10.9) it violates . Functions of an Operator In our sojourns through the fields of quantum mechanics, we'll often want to manipulate operator functions of varying complexity. Nearly all operator functions can be written in terms of the elementary operators x and p. Operator functions as simple as p2/(2m) or mw5X2/2 pose no problem. But more formidable concoctions, such as eQ, are a bit trickier. We can subdue even the most complicated operator function via its power-series expansion: Rule Any function J(A) of an operator A can be expressed as a power series in A, provided the power-series expansion of the corresponding classical function f (A) converges.\" 4See Chap. 6 of Scattering Theory by J. R. Taylor (New York: Wiley, 1972). 5 Although the issue of convergence poses interesting mathematical questions. it is not a problem in practice. If you are interested. see. for example, Â§ 9.1 in Principles of Quantum Mechanics by R. Shankar (New York: Plenum, 1980). 442 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I According to our prescription for generating operators, the coefficients in the series for the operator f(A) are the very coefficients bj that appear in the power series expansion of the function f(A), 00 (10.12)f(A) = L bjAj. j=O So once we know the series expansion of the function, Eq. (10.12), we know the expan- sion of the corresponding operator: 00 f(A.) = L bjAj. j=O (10.13) Note that if the function f(A) is real, then the coefficients bj in the expansion of the operator f (A) are also real. (10.140) (1O.14b) 00 = LbjX j , j=O Example 10.3. The Exponential Operator To use the operator eX we must know its effect on a function of x. To find out, we look to the series expansion of the corresponding exponentialftmction e\" [cf, Eq. (9.72)], x 1 2 1 3 e = 1 + x + -x + -x + ... 2! 3! 1 bj =\"'7j' J. 00 = Lbjx i j=O According to the above rule, the operator eX is simply X 1 A 1 A 2 1. 3e = + x + -x + -x + . .. 2! 3! 1 bj =\"'7j' J . (10.150) (10. 15b) Well, that' was pretty simple. Actually, manipulating operators as series expansions is not always this easy. But you're unlikely to go wrong if you remember the First Golden Rule of Operator Algebra: Rule To evaluate the product of two or more operators, act with each operator in succession. [For example, Q3 f = QQQ f.] This rule tells us how to evaluate the tenus in the power series expansion (10.13) we must retain for this series to accurately approximate the operator f(A). The Derivative of an Operator In Chap. 11 we'll find out how observables in quantum mechanics evolve, a topic that will lead us to expressions involving the time derivative of an operator, dQ(t)/dt. Happily, Sec. 10.2 More Mathematics of Quantum-Mechanical Operators 443 such expressions are easy to deal with. The derivative of an operator, which is just another operator, is defined like the derivative of a function. And derivatives of operators obey the familiar rules of differentiation of functions, e.g., (10.100) (1O.16b) There is, however, a trap lurking in Eq. (10.16b) ; can you see it? We must not blithely interchange the order of the operators in the terms on the right-hand side, for there is no guarantee that [!tA] (t)] A2(t ) is the same operator as A2 (t ) [!tA] (t)]. These operators are equivalent only if they commute. Thus, in working with derivatives of operators, don 't overlook the Second Golden Rule of Operator Algebra: Rule Thou shalt not interchange the order of operation of two operators unless thou art sure they commute. Ubiquitous Integrals (Dirac Braket Notation) Certain characteristic integrals are woven throughout the fabric of quantum mechanics. Already we've calculated expectation values , integrals of the form J~ocw* (x, t)QW(x, t) dx [cf, Eq. (10.3a)] . Somewhat similar integrals appeared in our study of non-stationary states of the particle-in-a-box (Example 7.4) and of the simple harmonic oscillator (Â§ 9.10). In both of these examples we had to cope with ma- trix elements , integrals in which an operator is sandwiched between two different state functions, e.g., J~x wi (x, t)HW2(X, t) dx. In these examples we also had to evaluate overlap integrals , which look like matrix eiements but for the absence of an operator , e.g., J~oc Wi (x ,t)W2(X, t) dx. All these types of integrals can be easily and conveniently represented using Dirac braket notation. Dirac brakets are just shorthand symbols for integrals. In its most general form, the Dirac braket is defined as (WI IQW2) == J WiQW2 dv all space (10.17) By variously labelling the state functions in (10.17), using the appropriate volume ele- ments and limits of integration , and retaining or omitting the operator Q, we can accom- modate all sorts of overlap integrals, expectation values, and matrix elements: 444 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I (Q) = (WI I QWI) = J WiQwI dv expectation value (l0.18a) all sp a ce (WI I QW2) = J WiQW2 dv matrix element (l0.18b) all s pace (WI I W2) = J WiW2 dv. overlap integral (1O.18c) all space The symbol (WI I QW2) represents an integral over all the spatial coordinates in W, so these matrix elements, expectation values, and overlap integrals are just numbers. They may be real or complex, and may depend on time. The Dirac braket is more \"abstract\" than the explicit expression for the integral it represents, and therein lies its great utility. This notation is simpler because it leaves several instructions implicit. To master Dirac brakets, remember these implicit instruc- tions: I . Take the complex conjugate of the state function to the left of the leftmost vertical bar. 2. Act with the operator Q on the function to its right. 3. Integrate the integrand WiQW2 over all space. For example, the Dirac braket for the expectation value of the linear momentum of a particle in one dimension in a quantum state represented by W(x, t) is (P) (t) = (\\l11 p\\l1) =i:w*(x,t) ffiw(x,t)] dx. (10.19a) The braket that represents the energy of a particle in three dimensions in state W(x, y, z, t) is (E) (t) = (w Iilw) =IfJw*(x, y, z, t) [il\\l1(x, y, z, t)] dx dy dz . (l0.19b) Dirac braket notation is very flexible. It can even accommodate integrals of (QWI)*W2' in which the operator acts on the first function , WI . By extension of the definition (10.17), we can represent such an integral by J [QWd*W2 dv = (QWI IW2) ' all space Note that so the integral in (10.20) is (QWII W2) = J [Q*WiJW2dv . all s pace (10.20) (10.21) (10.22) Sec. 10.2 More Mathematics of Quantum-Mechanical Operators 445 In practice, Dirac notation is complicated slightly by the, convention of the second vertical bar. Usually the braket (WI I QW2) is written (WI I Q I W2) .6 The second bar should cause no confusion provided you remember that in general (10.23) There is, however, an extremely important class of operators for which the second and third brakets in (10.23) are equal. If Q is a Hermitian operator, then the number (WI I QW2) is equal to (QWl I W2)' We'll study Hermitian operators in the next section. It may seem that the only reason for introducing braket notation is to avoid writer 's cramp. Not so. This more abstract notation greatly facilitates deriving results of quantum theory, as you'll see in this and subsequent chapters . Our tools are the simple properties in Table 10.4, which follow from the definition of the Dirac braket, Eq. (10.17). These properties are easy to prove, and doing so will provide useful practice with Dirac brakets. And by memorizing these properties, you can improve your chances of becoming an ace quantum mechanic.

Then use these properties to prove Property IV. 10.3 OPERATORS WITH FREEDOM OF CHOICE: HERMlnCITY I hate definitions. -Benjamin Disraeli in Vivian Grey Not every mathematical instruction can represent an observable. Just as a complex function can represent a quantum state only if it is normalizable , an operator can represent a physically measurable quantity only if it satisfies a property called Hermiticity. 6This convention originates in an abstract treatment of quantum mechanics in which the state we represent by the wave function i'2(x , t) is represented by an abstract beast called a ket and denoted 1i'2 ). The state that results when a quantum-mechanical operator Q acts on this ket is Q 1i'2). In this formulation, the Dirac braket is actually the sea/or product of this ket with another abstract beast that represents the state with wave function i' t . Called a \" bra,\" this critter is denoted by (i'l I. 446 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I Hermiticlty Defined What is Henniticity? Well, in the last section I made a big deal out of Eq. (10.23), noting that only for certain operators Q is the matrix element ('11 1 I Q'I12 ) equal to (Q'I11 I '112 ) . Equality of these matrix elements is, in fact, the definition of Henniticity: an operator Q is Hermitian if for any two physically-admissible state functions '111 and '112 , Hermiticity (10.24a) This definition is so important that I want to show it to you in its full integral glory: J 'I1i [Q'I12 ] dv = J all space all space (1O.24b) Since the equality in Eqs. (10.24) must hold for any two state functions, Hermiticity is a property of the operator itself-as we'll see in Â§ 10.4, where we'll liberate this definition from dependence on slate functions.\" Notice, by the way, that the double-bar notation ('111 IQ 1'112 ) in (1O.24a) makes eminent sense for an Hermitian operator, since such an operator has freedom of choice: it can operate on either '112 or on '111; the value of the matrix element is the same in either case. Question 16-4 In some quantum mechanics texts, you will find this alternate definition of Henniticity: an operator Q is Hermitian if for any physically-admissible state function Ill, (Ill I QIlI) = (QIlI I Ill) . (10.25) Prove that this definition is equivalent to (10.240) by considering a superposition state whose wave function III is a linear combination of two state functions, i.e., (10.26) What are the implications of Eq. (10.25) for the expectation value of Q? As you peer at Eqs. (10.24), trying to decipher the meaning of this abstract, remote definition, you may wonder why all operators aren 't Hermitian, The answer , perhaps surprisingly, has nothing to do with the complex conjugation in this definition-as you can see from the following example. 700 you remember where you first saw Hermiticity? In Chap. 6 we discovered that the Hamiltonianit of a system is Hermitian. After proving (Â§ 6.5) that the position probability density of a particle is conserved, I noted [cf-, Eq. (6.82)] that as a consequence the Hamiltonian satisfies 1:1JI*(x,t)itlJl(x,t)dx =1:[itlJl(x,t>]* lJI(x,t)dx, i.e.; the Hamiltonian is Hermitian. This finding illustrates how an abstract mathematical property, Hermiticity of an operator, is tied to a physical property, conservation of probability. Sec. 10.3 Operators with Freedom of Choice: Hermiticity 447 Example 10.4. A Non-Hermitian Operator What could be simpler than a first derivative? Let's find out whether or not the operator it = a/ax is Hermitian by testing the definition (1O.24b) for specific states. Let IIt l and 1It2 be the wave functions of the ground and first-excited states of the simple harmonic oscillator at t = 0 (see Table 9.6). (Note that these functions are real.) For this case, we can easily evaluate the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (10.24) with the aid of Table 9.7; to wit: ( IIt l I :x lit2) =1:tPo(x)~tPl (x) dx = ~ (:x IIt l Ilit2) =1: [~tPo(x)] tPl(X) dx = - ~. (lO.27a) (1O.27b) Oh what a difference a minus sign can make! Since (1O.27a) and (lO.27b) are different, the operator it violates the definition (10.24) and hence is not Hermitian. Notice that you can disprove Henniticity by finding a single pair of functions that violates the definition (10.24). Novice quantum physicists sometimes mistakenly try to prove Henniticity in the same way, i.e., using only a single pair of functions. (For some reason, such attempts usually involve the function ei k x .) So heed well this Warning You cannot prove that an operator is Hermitian by showing that the definition (10.24) is satisfied for a particular function; you must prove it for an arbitrary function. Example 10.5. An Hermitian Operator Having shown you an operator that is not Hermitian, it is incumbent upon me to show you one that is. The operator p = -ina/ax is one of the most important in quantum physics, so we certainly should check that it is legitimate. To do so, we must answer the burning question (1O.28a) For a one-dimensional system, the integral form of (1O.28a) is 1:lIti (x, t) [-in:x lit2(x, t)] dx 1:1:[-in:x IIt l(x, t)rlit2(x, t) dx. (1O.28b) We can prove thatp is Hermitian if we can manipulate the left-hand side ofEq. (lO.28b) into the form of the right-hand side, i.e., if we can shift the first derivative from lit2 (x , t) to IItl(x, t) without otherwise altering the integrand. The most straightforward way to do this is to use integration by parts, viz} 8Remember your freshman calculus? There you learned that the definite integral J: u dv can be written as l b udv = uv[ -l b vdu. 8\"'-To apply this method to Eq. (10.280), we use u = lJti and dv = ~ dx . 448 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I I: '11;(x,t) [-ili 8 8 x'112(x,t)] dx = -ili{ ['11; (x, t)'112(X, t)] [00-I: W2(X, t)a:w;(x, t) dx } . (10.29) But '111 (X, t) and '112(X, t) are nonnalizable and hence go to zero in the limit x -+ Â±oo. Therefore the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (10.29) is zero , leaving I: W;(x,t) [-ili 8 8 x W2(X ,t)] dx=(-ili) [-I: 8~~}'112(X,t)dX] (1O.30a) =I: [-ili:x Wt(x ,t)r W2(x,t)dx (1O.30b) =(pW1 IW2). (lO.30c) Ergo, p is Hermitian. Another word of advice: Readers unfamiliar with such mathematical demonstra- tions may be tempted to try manipulating both sides of Eq. (lO.28b), seeking a common ground. This is almost invariably the wrong way to approach such a derivation; success is much more likely if you will try to manipulate one side into the form of the other, as in this example. Question 16-5 Prove from the definition of Henniticity that the position operator x is Hermitian and that xp is not Hermitian, Question 10-6 Prove that it = 31 (where 1 is the \"identity operator,\" which does nothing) is Hermitian and that it = 3il is not Hermitian. So What? (The Consequences of Hermiticlty) Hermiticity is important in quantum mechanics because Rule All operators in quantum mechanics are Hermitian. Hermiticity is physically significant because it guarantees that the numbers that quantum mechanics predicts for the results of laboratory measurement will be real, not complex. This result is so important that we're now going to prove it: Proclamation 10.1 The expectation values of a Hermitian operator are real. Sec. 10.3 Operators with Freedom of Choice: Hermiticity 449 Argument: To prove this assertion (cf, Question 10-4), I will call upon a basic fact about complex numbers.? a number c is real if it is equal to its complex conjugate, c* = c We want to prove that for a Hermitian operator Q, the expectation value (Q) = J W*QW dv all space is equal to its complex conjugate. This is not hard to do: (lO.31) (lO.32) (Q)* = J (W*)* [QWr dv (lO.33a) all space = J W[QWr dv (1O.33b) all space = J [QWrW dv. (10.33c) all space But since Q is Hermitian, the integral in (lO.33c) is equal to Ergo IQ Hermitian J W*QW dv = (Q) . all space (Q)* = (Q) i.e., (Q) is real I (10.34) (10.35) Q. E. D. Can you see why Proclamation lO.1 is so important? The expectation value of any observable is supposed to be measurable; it's the average of values obtained in an ensemble measurement of the observable. But numbers measured in a laboratory are real, so the expectation value must be real. According to (lO.35), this requirement can be satisfied if (and only if) the operator that represents the observable is Hermitian. (In Â§ lO.6 we'll explore further the consequences of Hermiticity.) Before leaving this proof, I want to repeat it in Dirac notation: (Q)* = (w IQW)* = (QW Iw) = (w IQW) = (Q) [Property III: Table lOA] [Hermiticity of Q] [definition (l0.32) of (Q)]. (10.300) (1O.36b) (1O.36c) (1O.36d) 9It's easy to verify Eq. (10.31). A complex number c can be written in terms of its real and imaginary parts, as c = a+ib. where a and b are real numbers. The complex conjugate of c is, by definition, c\" = a - ib. So c\" = c only if b = 0, i.e.â€¢ if c is real. (See also Appendix K.) 450 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I Notice how much simpler and more elegant this shorthand notation is. Once you become reasonably facile with Dirac brakets, you can whip out proofs like this in your sleep . Hermitian Operators In Combination When presented with an operator that purports to represent an observable, the first thing you should do is verify its Henniticity. Checking the Henniticity of simple operators. such as the kinetic energy operator t = p2j(2m) or the angular momentum operator (in three dimensions) L= r x p, is fairly easy . But not all operators are so simple. As the complexity of the dependence of Q on x and p increases, so does the difficulty of proving it Hermitian. Fortunately, a simple set of general rules answers the question: what functions of one or more operators are Hermitian? For reference, I've collected these properties together in Table 10.5. Let's see how to prove them . TABLE 10.5 FUNCTIONS OF HERMITIAN OPERATORS: ARE THEY HERMITIAN?

This case is rarely a problem, because Rule Any real function of a single Hermitian operator is Hermitian. This rule takes care of simple operators, such as the potential energy operator of the half-infinite linear potential (Â§ 9.11). as well as troublemakers, such as eO of Exam- ple 10.3. You can prove it by expanding the arbitrary real operator in a power series, a la Eq. (10.13). Sec. 10.3 Operators with Freedom of Choice: Hermiticity 451 Question 16-7 Prove from the definition of Henniticity that the kinetic and potential energy operators for the simple harmonic oscillator, T and V(x) = mw~x2/2, are Hermitian. Isn't it easier to use the properties in Table 1O.5? More interesting conundrums arise if two or more operators are involved, for then the Henniticity of the operator function depends critically on the nature of the constituent operators. For example, x and pare Hermitian; but not all functions of x and p are Hennitian-a point illustrated in Table 10.6 and in the following example. TABLE 10.6 HERMITIAN AND NONÂ·HERMITIAN COMBINATIONS OF x AND p. Hermitian Non-Hermitian x,p xp,fJ:i; i [x,p] [x,p] Example 10.6. The Product of Two Hermitian Operators Let QI and Q2 be Hermitian operators; i.e., suppose that for arbitrary physically-admissible state functions IJfI and 1Jf2, (1JfI I QI 11Jf2) = (1Jf2 Io. IIJfI) (1Jf 1 I Q2 11Jf2) = (1Jf2 I Q2 11Jf 1 ) . (1O.37a) (1O.37b) Our goal is to find the conditions (if any) under which the product operator Q3 == QIQ2 is Hermitian; i.e., I: 'ili (x , t )Q31Jf2(X, t ) dx ~I: [Q31Jf1(X,t)]\" 1Jf2(x,t)dx, or, in Dirac Notation (1O.38a) (l0.38b) We can explore this question using the Hermiticity of QI and Q2 and the meaning of a product of two operators: I:lJfi(X,t)Q31Jf2(X,t)dx =I: lJfi(x,t){ QI [Q21Jf2(X,t)] } dx =I: [QIlJft(x, t)rQ21Jf2(X,t) da: =I: [Q2Q IlJf t(X ,t)]\"1Jf2(x,t)dx. (1O.39a) (l0.39b) ( 1O.39c) Notice carefully that I had to put Q2 before QI in Eq. (l0.39c) . The expression in (1O.39c) is not equal to the right-hand side of Eq. (10.38) unless Q2QI = QI Q2, i.e., unless these Hermitian operators commute. 452 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I We have discovered another rule: Rule The product of two Hermitian operators is Hermitian if and only if the two operators commute. It is convenient to express this finding in terms of the commutator of C;~h and Q2, which is defined in Eq. (10.20):10 I Q3 = QIQ2 is Hennitian Â¢:::::> [QI,Q2] = 0 I (10.40) Question 10--8 Under what conditions on three Hermitian operators Ql, Q2, and Q3 is the product QI Q2Q3 Hermitian? Can you generalize your result to the product of N Hermitian operators? We have already evaluated the commutator of x and p in Example 5.4, [x,p] = xp - JJX = ild . Since [x,p] # 0, the product XjJ is not Hermitian (see Question 10-5). Question 10-9 The anti-commutator of two operators Ql and Q2 is defined as (10.41) anti-commutator (10.42) Show that the anti-commutator of x and p is Hermitian. What quantum-mechanical operator should be used to represent the classical observable xp? Here's what the above proof looks like in Dirac notation [see Eq. (l0.38b)]: (1111 IQI(21112) = (QIWI I(21112) = (Q2QI WI IW2) = (QIQ2 WI 11112) [Herrniticity of Qd [Herrniticity of Q2] [if [Ql ,Q2] = 0]. (10.430) (1O.43b) (1O.43c) So much for the product of two Hermitian operators. But other combinations of these operators are possible, e.g., their sum. Example 10.7. Linear Combinations of Hermitian Operators Suppose o, and Q2 are Hermitian operators and CI and C2 are complex constants. Is Q3 == CI QI + C2Q2 Hermitian? Go ahead, take a guess. *** Pause while reader ponders *** Now let's find the answer. IOThe symbol <==> is mathematicians' notation for \"if and only if,\" also known in the trade as \"iff:' Sec. 10.3 Operators with Freedom of Choice: Hermiticity 453 All we need to answer this question (using Dirac notation) are the properties in Table 10.4. By Property IV, we have (10 .44) Using the Henniticity of {JI and 0 2, the right-hand side of (10.44) becomes Moving the constant to the left of each bar, we obtain (WI I (CIOI + C2( 2)W2) = (C~OIWI IW2) + (C;021{11 IW2) = ((C~OI +C;(2)WI I W2)' (10.45) (10.400) (1O.46b) [Notice carefully that I had to take the complex conjugate of the constants when I moved them . If you don 't understand why, write out Eq. (10.45) in its full integral form and derive from it Eq . (1O.46a).) But the operator to the left of the bar in Eq. (1O.46b) is not equal to 03 unless CI and C2 are real. So only in this special case is 03 Hermitian: Rule An arbitrary linear combination of two (or more) Hermitian operators is Hermitian if and only if the constants in the linear combination are real numbers, (10.47) Question 16-10 Repeat the proof of Eq. (10 .47) using the full integral form of the matrix elements involved. To show you how to check Henniticity using the rules in Table 10.6, I'll work one final example. Example 10.8. The Kinetic Energy Operator The kinetic energy operator - 2 T = L (10.48) 2m is the product of a real constant and the operator p2. Since p is Hermitian, so is any power of p. And the product of a real constant times a Hermitian operator is another Hermitian operator. So. with little difficulty and without explicit recourse to the defin ition (cf. , Question 10-1), we confidently conclude that T is a Hermitian operator. Question 16-11 Prove that the Morse potential [see Figs . 8.2 and 9.14) a =a real constant is Hermitian. Question 16-12 Prove that the Hamiltonian of a particle in the Morse potential of Question 10-11 , if. = T + V, is Hermitian. 454 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I Question 16-13 Consider a system with a Hamiltonian it in a state represented by W.

It is merely the etherealization of common sense. -William Thompson (Lord Kelvin) 1824-1907 In Â§ 10.3. I asserted that Henniticity is a property of operators. unrelated to the state functions on which they operate. Yet. I defined this property in Eq. (I0.24a) in terms of state functions WI and W2. If Henniticity pertains solely to an operator. then we should be able to define it independently of state functions. Mathematicians know how to do this. using a quaint and curious beastie called \"the adjoint.\" What is an adjoint? Well. consider the following whimsical puzzle: Suppose A is an arbitrary operator. not necessarily Hermitian, For any two state functions construct the matrix element (WI I AW2) = J Wi [AW2] dv. all s p ace (10.51) This matrix element is just a number. Find another operator. say E. such that the number (EWI I W2) equals (WI I AW2). i.e.â€¢ the operator E is defined by (E WI 1'112 ) = J [E wd *W2dv = (wII Aw2)' a ll s pace (10.52) Sec. 10.4 Fun with Adjoints 455 The desired operator is called the adjoint of A, denoted At, and I'm going to show you how to construct it.ll That is, the adjoint of A is the operator At such that adjoint. (10.53) Example 10.9. The Adjoint of the First Derivative Operator In Example 10.4 we demonstrated that the operator A = a/ax is not Hermitian. To find the adjoint of this operator we use integration by parts (cf , Example 10.5). For a one- dimensional system, the matrix element we must juggle is (10.540) (1O.54b) Since the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (l0.54b) is zero (why?), we must grapple with only the second term. To identify the adjoint of A, we must write this term so it looks like the left-hand side of (10.53): This manipulation unmasks the adjoint: (10.55) A a A=-ax which is consistent with Example 10.4. At a A =--,ax (10.56) Question 10-15 Consider A = C, where c is a complex number. Prove that At = c\", The Adjoint of a Hermitian Operator A Hermitian operator has a particularly simple adjoint, as you should be able to imme- diately deduce from the definition of Hermiticity (10.240) and of the adjoint (10.53):12 Rule A Hermitian operator is its own adjoint, and, conversely, an operator that equals its own adjoint is Hermitian; i.e., Q Hermitian Qt =Q. (10.57) II Mathematicians also refer to the adjoint of an operator as its \"Hermitian conjugate\" whetheror not the operator in question is Hermitian. To avoid the obvious source of confusion, I'm going to use only the term \"adjoint.\" 12Equation (10.57) explains why mathematicians often refer to a Hermitian operator as \"self-adjo int\" 456 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I So one way to determine whether or not a particular operator is Hermitian is to find its adjoint and just look at it. But, to judge from Example 10.9, this scheme is no simpler than direct application of the definition of Hermiticity. Happily, the determination of adjoints is rendered quite easy by a host of general properties, the most important of which appear in Table 10.7. TABLE 10.7 OPERATORS AND THEIR ADJOINTS. Operator Adjoint A At CtAt + c2A2 ciAi + c2A~ AB BtAt [A,B] [ 't ' t]A,B [A,Bt [A,B]+ AtA AtA Question 1~16 Prove that if A is linear, so is At. Question 1~17 Prove from the definition of the adjoint that (AiJ) t = iJtAt and derive the adjoint of the anticommutator [A, iJ]-: Example 10.10. The Position-Momentum Product Reconsidered We can ascertain whether the operator xp is Hermitian by inspecting its adjoint. With Table 10.7 at hand, evaluating the adjoint of xp is a snap: (xP)t = pt xt =px, (l0.58a) (l0.58b) where in the last step I used the Hermiticity of x and of p. Since x and p don't commute, Px '\" xp, and we conclude that the operator xp is not Hermitian. Question 1~18 Determine the adjoint of the operator si: where T is the kinetic energy operator (10.48). Is xT Hermitian? The adjoint provides a useful (albeit abstract) tool for studying Hermiticity and manipulating operators. But the real reason for introducing all these tools is to study the physics of operators in quantum mechanics. To a great extent, the importance of these operators rests in their eigenvalue equations, to which we now tum. Sec . 10.4 Fun with Adjoints 457 10.5 ALL ABOUT EIGENVALUE EQUATIONS \"Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention?\" \"To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.\" \"The dog did nothing in the night-time.\" \"That was the curious incident,\" remarked Sherlock Holmes. -Silver Blaze by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle An operator can wreak cons iderable havoc, transforming the function on which it acts into a quite different function. Consider, for example, the effect of the linear momentum operator on the initial wave function for a simple harmonic oscillator in its first excited (stationary) state (Table 9.6) : pWl(X,O) = - i1i. d~ [2Al.Bxe-,82X2/2] (10.59) = _2i1i.A 1.Be-,82 X2/2 (1 - .B2x2) , (10 .60) where Al is the normalization constant of Eq. (9.106). Observe that the dependence on x of the function pWl(x , 0) is quite different from that of WI(x, 0). But something strange happens when the system Hamiltonian operates on this function: we get (10 .61) There are two reasons why the Hamiltonian operator gives back the same function times a constant: first, Wl(X,O) = 7P1(X) is a stationary-state wave function; and second, Eq. (10 .61) is just the time-independent Schrodinger Equation (TIS E). As noted in Chap. 7, the TISE is an eigenvalue equation, and W1(X,0) = 7P1(X) is an eigenfunc- tion of the Hamiltonian with eigenvalue E 1 â€¢13 Eigenvalue Equations on Parade The form of the eigenvalue equation for an operator A with eigenfunction Xa and eigenvalue a is AXa = aXa' eigenvalue equation (10 .62) The collection of all the eigenvalues of A is called the spectrum of this operator. The number of eigenvalues in the spectrum may be (and usually is) infinite. And these values may be discrete, continuous, or both. For example, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of an infinite square well-the energies obtained by solving the TISE-is discrete (Â§ 7.4); that of the Hamiltonian for a barrier potential (Â§ 8.6) is continuous; and that of the finite square well (Â§ 8.8) includes both discrete and continuous eigenvalues. A notational note: when discussing discrete eigenvalues, we may label the eigen- function by the eigenvalue, as in (10 .62), or by an index j, e.g., 13The word \"eigenvalue\" is of Gennan origin and means \"proper value,\" \"self value,\" or \"characteristic value.\" In fact, some mathematicians refer to eigenvalue equations as \"characteristic equations,\" 458 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I [discrete eigenvalues only] (10.63) Continuum eigenvalues are their own index-i.e., they are used to label their eigenfunc- tions, as in Eq. (10.62). Example 10.n. A Cornucopia of Eigenvalue Equations In our journey through quantum physics we have espied several eigenvalue equations other than the TISE. While making the acquaintance of the linear momentum operator (Chap. 5), we solved the equation for the eigenfunction x (x) = _l_e iPx/Ti . P J2rrn (10.64) (10.65) Recall that the prefactor multiplying this eigenfunction ensures that it will satisfy Dirac Delta Function Normalization, i.e., (10.66) The eigenvalue equation (10.64) has only continuum eigenvalues , as does the corresponding equation for the position operator, (1O.67a) The Dirac Delta function shows up in a most peculiar way in the eigenvalue equation for the position operator : it turns out that 6(x - xo) is the eigenfunction of this operator with eigenvalue zo, i.e., x6(x - xo) = xo6(x - xo) . (1O.67b) We'll return to the ramifications of this odd result in Chap. 13. I should note, though, that it makes a screwy kind of sense: were the state function of an ensemble of particles an eigenfunction of position, then the location of the members of the ensemble would be well- defined (i.e., sharp). This physical situation is reflected by the eigenfunction in (10.67a): out of all possible locations, the Dirac Delta function 6(x - xo) \"selects\" zo (recall the discussion of this function in Chap. 4 and Appendix L). [Don't forget, though, that because 6(x - xo) can't be normalized, it's not physically admissible.] We have also glimpsed the eigenvalue equation for the parity operator in our studies of bound-state eigenfunctions of symmetric potentials [cf., Â§ 8.7]. The parity operator, which we denote by IT. inverts the spatial coordinates ofa function through the origin. taking x into - x: ITf(x) = f(-x) . parity operator (10.68) The simple spectrum of IT includes only two discrete eigenvalues , +1 (for an even function) and - 1 (for an odd function): ITf(x) = { +f(x) -f(x) if f(x) is even if f(x) is odd eigenfunctions of the parity operator (10.69) In Â§ 10.8 we'll prove that these are the only eigenvalues of the parity operator and will scrutinize the eigenfunctions of this important operator. Sec. 10.5 All About Eigenvalue Equations 459 What to Do in Case of Degeneracy The labelling of eigenfunctions becomes a bit more complicated for degenerate eigen- values. If, to an eigenvalue q, there corresponds one and only one eigenfunction Xq, then this eigenvalue is non-degenerate. This parlance is an obvious extension of our use in Chap. 9 of the word \"non-degenerate\" to describe energy eigenvalues. In Â§ 9.4 (Proclamation 9.1) we proved that the bound-state eigenfunctions of a one-dimensional system are unique, so their energies are non-degenerate. In fact, this proof illustrates a general principle: Rule The discrete eigenvalues of any operator that represents an observable of a single-particle system in one dimension are non-degenerate. This principle does not hold for two- and three-dimensional systems; nor does it pertain to many-particle systems . The bound-state energies of the (one-electron) hydrogen atom, for example, are degenerate: to each eigenvalue En of the H atom Hamiltonian (where n is an integer n 2:: 1) there correspond 2n2 distinct eigenfunctions. (Remember that by \"distinct\" we mean linearly independent.) The jargon appropriate to this situation is: the bound-state energies of the H atom are \"2n 2-fold degenerate.\" Eigenstates In quantum mechanics, we are particularly interested in eigenvalue equations for the state function, e.g.,14 eigenstate (10.70) Such a state is so important we give it a special name: an eigenstate : W an eigenfunction of Q ==} system in an eigenstate of the observable Q (10.71) There is, of course, no guarantee that the state represented by W is an eigenstate of any operator. But for most states of most systems, we can find one (or more) operators that act on W to produce this function times a constant, the eigenvalue. So remember the following: 14 1 have purposely left unspecified the spatial variables and the time in this equation (and in many others in this chapter) to emphasize the generality of abstract equat ions such as (10.70). In one dimension. this eigenvalue equation looks like QIJ1(x, t) = qlJ1(x, t) . It is important to realize that unless Q explicitly contains the time or derivatives thereof, it is the coordinate dependence of IJ1 that is importantin its eigenvalue equation . For this reason, many authors write this equation as I'm using subscripts for other things, so I won't use this convention. 460 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I Warning Equation (10.71) must hold at all times if the state represented by lit is an eigenstate of Q; the system is not in an eigenstate if this equation is (accidentally) satisfied at one (or more) particular times. The most familiar example of an eigenstate is a stationary state, which is an energy eigenstate . To see why, we need only recall that the wave function of such a state is separable, (10.72) (10.73) iT!E = 1/JEe- i E t/ h â€¢ Hence this state function is an eigenfunction of the Hamilton ian, 'fliT! E = EiT! E, which means that the state is an eigenstate of the energy. Question 16-19 Prove that a simple harmonic oscillator in its (stationary) ground state is not in an eigenstate of linear momentum. A system can be (and, in fact, usually is) in an eigenstate of more than one observable. All that is required is that the state function be an eigenfunction of both of the corresponding operators, e.g., (10.74)simultaneous eigenstate of Ql and Q201iT!ql .q 2 = ql iT!ql ,Q2 02iT!ql ,q2 = q2iT!ql ,Q2 ' As the label on Eq. (10.74) attests, we call such a state a simultaneous eigenstate of the observables.P For example, the stationary states of the symmetricfinite square well are eigenstates of energy, (10 .75a) and of parity (1O.75b) (Remember that the ground state of this system is even and is labelled by n = 1.) Thus, these states are simultaneous eigenstates of energy and parity . The subject of simultaneous eigenstates will come into its own in Chap . 11. Question 16-20 Are the stationary states of an asymmetric square well simultaneous eigenstates of energy and parity? . . . of energy and any other operator you can think of? 15There is more 10 this remark than meets the eye. A quantum system can be characterized, in a very abstract way. by the set of all operators of which the state function is an eigenfunction. Such a set is said to be \"complete\" (a word we'll meet in a different context in Â§ 10.7). Since these operators all commute with one another, this set is called the \"complete set of commuting operators\" of the system-its CSCO. For a succinct introduction to the CSCO, see Â§ 4.6 of A Quantum Mechanics Primerby Daniel T. Gillespie (London: International Textbook, 1970). Sec. 10.5 All About Eigenvalue Equations 461 Question 10-21 In Chap. 4 we studied the pure-momentum function of the free particle, w(x , t) = Ae-i(px-EI)/F,. Of what two operators is this a simultaneous eigenfunction? Why is such a simultaneous eigenstate not seen in the laboratory? Eigenstates and Measurement Quantum mechanics care whether or not a system is in an eigenstate of an observable because of the consequences for measurement of the observable. For example, as we learned in Chap. 7 and saw illustrated in Chaps. 8 and 9, in an energy eigenstate (10.72) the energy is sharp. In statistical terms, this statement means that the average value of energy is equal to the eigenvalue ofic and the uncertainty in the energy is zero: { (E ) (t) = E . AE(t) = 0 [energy eigenstate] (10.76) This is not merely an abstract mathematical result. It means that if you wander into your lab and perform an ensemble measurement of the energy of a particle that's in an energy eigenstate, you'll find that all members exhibit the same value, the eigenvalue E. Were the ensemble in a non-stationary state, however, the results of your measurement would be quite different (a situation we'll confront in Chap 12). Equation (10.76) suggests a provocative connection between the eigenvalue equa- tions for a state function and the results of measurement of an observable Q, a connection shown schematically in Fig. 1O.t. The proof of this connection follows rather simply from the definitions of (Q) and AQ. (al (b) Figure 10.1 A symbolic representation of measurement MQ of an observable Q 011 a quantum system initially in (a) an eigenstate of Q represented by state function Wq ; (b) a state II' that is not an eigenstate of Q. The box in each figure denotes the measurement apparatus. and the arrows to the right of the box show the results exhibited by a few of the huge number of members in the ensemble on which the measurement is performed. (10.77) Proclamation 10.2 In an eigenstate of an observable, the uncertainty of this observable is zero, and its expec- tation value is equal to the eigenvalue of the operator that represents the observable. Argument: In mathematical language, this conjecture reads ~ { AQ(t) = 0 QiI!q = qiI!q Â¢::=;o (Q) (t) = q . We can prove both parts of (10.77) by deft use of the eigenvalue equation QiJ!q = qiJ!q. Thus, the expectation value 462 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I (1O.78a) becomes (1O.78b) The state function is nonnalizable, so ('lI q I 'lIq) = 1, and the right-hand side of (1O.78b) is just q. Therefore I (Q) (t) = q I [in an eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue q) (10.79) We'll use the same strategy to prove that ~Q(t) = O. We begin with the square of this quantity, (~Q)2 = (Q2) _ (Q)2 = (Q2) _ q2. [by Eq. (10.79)) (10 .800) (10 .80b) And we can easily evaluate the remaining expectation value, (Q2) , by repeated applica- tion of the eigenvalue equation and another judicious application of nonnalizability: (Q2) = ('lI q IQQ'lIq ) =q('lIq IQ'lI q ) = q2 ('lI q I 'lI q ) = q2. [by the eigenvalue equation] [by the eigenvalue equation] [by nonnalizability of \\II] (10.810) (1O.81b) (1O.8Ic) (1O.8Id) Substituting this result into Eq. (to .80b), we find, not surprisingly, that (~Q)2 = 0, whence [in an eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue q] (10.82) Q. E. D. Proclamation 10.2 assures us that we can be certain (within the limits of experi- mental accuracy) of the outcome of a measurement of an observable Q on a system that is in an eigenstate of Q: in such a measurement, all members yield the same value, the eigenvalue q. Proclamation 10.2 also shows how to determine experimentally whether or not a system is in an eigenstate of a particular observable: we just perform an ensemble measurement of the observable and see if all members give the same value. If so, the system is in an eigenstate. If, instead, the results fluctuate about (Q), then it is not in an eigenstate of the observable we measured-although it could be in an eigenstate of some other observable.!\" For example, the ground-state of the simple harmonic oscillator is an eigenstate of energy and parity [recall that 1/Jo(x) is an even function], but it's not an eigenstate of p, nor of X, as we proved in Examples 9.4 and 9.5. So a measurement of the energy of a SHO in such a state will yield the same result, unlike a measurement of position. 16Actually, this procedure is a little tricky. As we'll learn in Chap. 13. if an ensemble is not in an eigenstate of Q before measurement of this observable, it will be after the measurement. That is. were we to test an ensemble that originally was not in an eigenstate by measuring Q, then after the measurement the ensemble would be in an eigenstate of Q and hence would differ from the original ensemble. So in practice we must effect our verification measurement on a sub-ensemble of the original ensemble of interest. Sec. 10.5 All About Eigenvalue Equations 463 10.6 CONSEQUENCES OF HERMITICITY I: REAL EIGENVALUES AND ORTHONORMAL EIGENFUNCTIONS In the last section we discussed the eigenvalue equation for an arbitrary operator. But in quantum mechanics, operators aren't arbitrary; they're Hermitian. And the properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are very special indeed . On the Reality of Eigenvalues We have proven (Proclamation 10.1, Â§ 10.3) that the expectation value of a Hermitian operator Q with respect to an arbitrary quantum state lIt, (Q) = J IIt*QIIt dv , all space (10.83) is a real number. This property is important because we can measure (Q) in the labora- tory. We have also proven (Proclamation 10.2, Â§ 10.5) that for a system in an eigenstate of Q, the expectation value (10.83) reduces to the appropriate eigenvalue q of the operator Q, i.e., (Q) = q. (10.84) The obvious implications of these two facts is that the set of all eigenvalues {q} of any Hermitian operator Q cons ists of real numbers. But this argument is deceptive, for it seems to hinge on the eigenfunction of Q being a state function . As we'll now prove, the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real regardless of the precise nature of the eigenfunctions. Proclamation 10.3 The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real numbers. Argument: We seek a proof that I Q Hermitian eigenvalues {q} are real The eigenvalue equat ion for an arbitrary Hermitian operator is17 (10.85) We know one way to prove that an eigenvalue q is real: show that it is equal to its complex conjugate [ct, Eq. (10.31)] , i.e., prove that q* = q. To this end, we first must l7The discussion of this section becomes needlessly complicated if the eigenvalues in question are continuous. So in the text. I'll assumethatall eigenvalues arediscrete. [But I will label eigenfunctions by their eigenvalues, not by an index, as in (10.63); students seem to find the lauer notation convenient in solutions of problems but confusing in proofs of properties.I In footnotes and asides. I'll show you what these results look like for a spectrum that includes continuous eigenvalues . Feel free to skip the footnotes if you aren't interested in the more general case. 464 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I isolate q. We do so by multiplying Eq. (10.85) on the left by X; and integrating over all . 18space, VIZ., (Xq IQXq) = q(Xq IXq). Now, the eigenfunctions {Xq} can be normalized, so we can use (10.86) (Xq I Xq) = 1 to simplify Eq. (10.86), obtaining normalization of eigenfunctions (10.87) q = (Xq IQXq). The complex conjugate of (1O.88a) is q* = (Xq I QXq)*. The rest of the proof that q* = q is a snap: (1O.88a) (1O.88b) q* = (QXq IXq), = (Xq IQXq), =q . [Property III: Table lOA] [Henniticity of QJ [by Eq.

The importance of this property will become evident in Chap. 13, which deals with measurement in quantum mechanics. There we'll discover the remarkable fact that the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are the only values we could obtain in a measurement of the observable represented by the operator. So these numbers must be real. And, for Hermitian operators, they are. On the Orthogonality of Eigenfunctions Of the many properties of the set {Xq} of eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator Q, the most familiar is its linear independence, i.e., L CqXq = 0 {:::::} cq = 0 all q for all q. linear independence (10.90) But the functions {Xq}, which we obtain by solving (somehow) the eigenvalue equation, have three other properties of great importance in quantum theory, each of which has affiliated with it special jargon: Rule The eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator are orthogonal, constitute a complete set, and satisfy closure. 18Remember that the \"integral over all space\" embraces all spatial coordinates in the eigenfunction. For a single particle in one dimension, this integral is f~oo.. . dx: for a single particle in three dimension, it is f ... dv. For a many-particle system, it is a multiple integral over the spatial coordinates of all all space particles (see Volume II). Sec. 10.6 Real Eigenvalues and Orthonormal Eigenfunctions 465 I now want to show you what these words mean, beginning with the one you're probably familiar with: orthogonality.t\" Orthogonality is an important (and familiar) property of vectors. The x and y axes of a Cartesian coordinate system, for example, are orthogonal. Letting ex and ey denote unit vectors along these axes, we can express their orthogonality mathematically using the dot product, as ex.ey= O. There is, in fact, a close analogy between the mathematics of vectors and of eigenfunctions; this parallel is a consequence of the fact that both are described by the same branch of mathematics, linear algebra. But in quantum mechanics, when we say that two (non-degenerate) eigenfunctions with different eigenvalues are orthogonal, we mean simply that their overlap integral is zero. To illustrate this general property in a specific case, consider the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions for the ground and first-excited states of a one-dimensional simple har- monic oscillator. In Fig. 10.2 are graphs of these eigenfunctions and of their product t/JO(X)1Pt (x). The area under this curve, J~oc t/JO(X)t/JI (x) dx, is the overlap of t/Jo(x) and t/JI (x). It is clear from the figure that the positive and negative contributions to this integral are equal, so (1O.91a) or, in Dirac notation, (1O.91b) Equations (10.91) \"are the mathematical statements of the orthogonality of t/Jo(x) and t/JI(X). But this property is no accident; it occurs because these functions are eigenfunc- tions of an operator (it) that is Hermitian, as I now propose to prove. Proclamation 10.4 Eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator whose (non-degenerate) eigenvalues are different are orthogonal. Argument: In Dirac notation, we express this assertion as20 19This is the only one of these three properties that I'll prove . To discuss in detail the mathematical justification for completeness and closure would take us too far afield into the formalism of quantum mechanics. The mathematically inquisitive among you can find proofs in Chap. V, Â§ 6, and Chap. VII of Quantum Mechanics by A. Messiah (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1965). 20lf the eigenvalues are continuous, the Dirac Delta function enters the picture, and the orthogonality relation (10.92) reads QXq = sxÂ« QXq' = q'X q' (q' =;6 q) } ==> [continuous eigenvalues] For example, the eigenvalues p of the linear momentum operator p are continuous, and the orthonormality integral for its eigenfunctions (10.65) is (Xp' IXI') = _1_1 00 e-ip'x/lieipx/Ii dx . 27rn -00 This integral is a fairly well-known form of the Dirac Delta function (see Appendix L) 6(p - p') . That is, the eigenfunctions of p satisfy the orthonormality relation 466 Chap . 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I 1.5 ....T\"\"T\"T\"\"T\"T\"\"T..,.......,..,~I\"'T'\"T\"\"T'\"T\"\"T\"TT\"T\"\"T..,.......,..,-nl\"'T'\"rrT\"TTTTT\"TT::I 2o-2 .....-...., / \\ . ,I :i\\, -.

To this end, let's multiply the first of these equations by X~' and integrate over all space. In Dirac notation, the result is (10.93) We can easily simplify the left-hand side of this equation using the Herrniticity of Q, viz., (Xq' IQX'l) = (QX'l' I Xq) = (q'X'l' I X'l) = q'. (X'l' I Xq) = q'(Xq' I X'l)' [Herrniticity of Q] [the eigenvalue equation (10.85)] [Property II, Table 10.4] [Proclamation 10.2] (10.940) ( 1O.94b) (1O.94c) (l0.94d) Pondering Eqs. (10.93) and (10.94), we light on the next step: subtract (1O.94d) from (10.93), viz., Sec. 10.6 Real Eigenvalues and Orthonormal Eigenfunctions 467 (q - q')(Xq' IXq) = O. (10.95) But by hypothesis q f. q'. So Eq. (10.95) can hold only if the overlap integral is zero. Q. E. D. Remembrances of Series Past Orthogonality is a property familiar from our study of elementary functions. In Chap. 4, while discussing the Fourier series expansion of a function f(x) , oo f(x) = ao + L [an cos (21rnlJ+ s; sin (21rnlJ], 1Â£=1 we noted that the sine and cosine functions satisfy the relations 1 L / 2 cos (21rny.) sin (21rmy.) dx = 0 -L/2 (10.96) (10.970) dx = 1 L / 2 sin (21rny.) sin (21rmy.) dx -L/2 = {O, ~fm f. n ; 1, if m = n . (1O.97b) Technically, Eqs. (10.97) are called \"orthonormality relations,\" because they combine orthogonality and the normalization condition; the latter is obtained when m = n. These trigonometric functions are, of course, related to the Hamiltonian eigenfunc- tions of the infinite square well [Eq. (7.55)], with real eigenvalues En = n21r 2 ;,?j(2mL 2 ) . So Eqs. (10.97) illustrate Proclamation lOA, expressing the orthogonality of the eigen- functions of the (Hermitian) Hamiltonian of the infinite square well. Aside: Dealing with Degeneracy by Orthogonalization. In the statement of Procla- mation 10.4, I deftly slipped in the qualifier \"non-degenerate,\" because two eigenfunc- tions that correspond to the same eigenvalue are not necessarily orthogonal. This is the case of degenerate eigenvalues: i.e., q = q' in the discussion above. Most eigen- values of most quantum-mechanical operators are degenerate; so what do we do in this case? Fortunately, we can always form from the eigenfunctions {Xq} another set of eigenfunctions all of whose elements are orthogonal. Each element of the new set is a linear combination of the original functions {xq}. Several procedures exist for constructing such sets; we'll examine one of these, the Gram-Schmidt orthogonal- ization procedure, in Volume II. The point to retain is that we can always find a set of linearly-independent eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator whose elements are orthonormal. 10.7 CONSEQUENCES OF HERMITICITY 1/: COMPLETENESS AND CLOSURE In Â§ 10.6 we proved two properties of the solutions of the eigenvalue equation for a Hermitian operator: the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenfunctions are orthogonal. In this section, we'll discuss (but not prove) a slightly more arcane property of these 468 Chap . 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I (to.98a) solutions. Although this property, completeness, is probably unfamiliar to you, it is actually one you've seen-in the Fourier series (to.96). This series illustrates that the set of functions {cos (21rnf) ,sin (21rnf)} is com- plete in the variable x. The completeness of this set offunctions means that any (suitably well-behaved)function f(x) that is periodic on the interval [-L/2, L/21 can be expanded in the elements of this set. The coefficients of this expansion, an and bn in (10.96), are determined from f(x) as rcf., Eq. (4.42)], 1jL/2 au = E f(x)dx -L/2 (to.98c) (l0.98b) (n=1,2, . .. ) (n=1,2, . . . )2jL/2 (X)an = E f(x) cos 21rnE dx -L/2 2jL/2 (X)bn = E f(x) sin 21rnE dx. -L/2 In quantum mechanics , completeness is a property of the set {Xq} of eigenfunctions of any Hermitian operator Q. (And it is not restricted to periodic functions .) Complete- ness of a set of eigenfunctions means that any well-behaved function of the variables on which the eigenfunctions depend can be expanded in the set, i.e., there exist coefficients cq such that a function f can be written as the series l:q CqXq.21 Completeness is an extremely important property, for it is the key to the expansion ofan arbitrary state function in an arbitrary (complete) set of eigenfunctions-a tactic the full value of which will come clear in the next chapter. Here's how such an expansion works mathematically.P 21By \"well-behaved\" I mean that f must be continuous everywhere; this adjective also usually requires that f be finite (but not necessarily normalizable) everywhere. For the mathematical details , see Â§ 7 of Quantum Mechanics, Volume I by K. Gottfried (New York: Benjamin, 1966). 22Yet another note regarding the trouble caused by pesky continuous eigenvalues: if the spectrum of an operator is continuous, then the completeness relation cannot be written as in (10.99), because we cannot sum over a continuous index. Instead we must integrate , viz., 'It = JcqXqdq. all q [continuous spectrum] For example, the Fourier integral for a free-particle wave funct ion [cf , Eq. (4.77)1 is an expansion of this function in the complete set of eigenfunctions of the linear momentum operato r: Note how the time dependence enters the expansion coefficients <:pet) = 'I>(p)e- iw t / h in this example. [Recall that for a free particle , the dispersion relat ion is w = E/li = lik 2/(2m) .] If the spectrum includes both discrete and cont inuous eigenvalues, the completeness relation looks even worse : co nt inuo us q 'It = L CqXq+ discrete q J CqXq dq. This form would be required , for example, to expand a function in the set of eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the finite symmetric square well. Sec. 10.7 Consequences of Hermiticity II: Completeness and Closure 469 Rule Any (physically-admissible) state function can be expanded in the complete set of eigen- functions of any Hermitian operator, provided the eigenfunctions satisfy the same boundary conditions as the state function: I Q'=Q eigenfunction expansion (10.99) In the parlance of quantum mechanics, the set of eigenfunctions we choose for the expansion is called the basis set. The coefficient cq is called the projection of III onto the basis function Xq' We'll see shortly how to calculate these projections for a particular wave function-although you may be able to guess how from Eq. (10.98). For example, we expand a wave function of a single particle in one dimension in the complete set of eigenfunctions {Xq(x)} as IlI(X, t) = L cq(t)Xq(X), all q and that of a single particle in three dimensions in the set {Xq(r)} as llI(r,t) = L cq(t)Xq(r). all q (1O.IOOa) (1O.IOOb) All such expansions have a common form: ( wave ) _ '\" (projection on ) function - LJ the eigenfunction a ll eig enfunctions ( eigenfunction of ) Hermitian operator . (lO.IOOc) Notice that the state function depends on time, so the expansion coefficients cq in (10.99) perforce depend on t. Note also that all eigenfunctions of Q must be included in these expansions. This means, in principle, that the sum in Eqs. (10.100) will contain an infinite number of terms. To be sure, for a particular state, some of the expansion coefficients cq may happen to be zero-if, as in Example 10.12 below, the function we are expanding has a symmetry property not shared by the eigenfunctions {Xq}. Nevertheless, you should memorize the following rule: Rule In general do not omit any eigenfunctions from a complete set expansion. Example 10.12. The Eigenfunctions of the SHO Hamiltonian The Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, if. = jJ2/(2m) + mw5X2/2, is Hermitian. So the set of its eigenfunctions , {t/J\" (x)} where n = 0, I, 2, .. . , is complete in the variable x and can be used as the basis set in an expansion of any well-behaved function of x that is spatially localized. The spectrum of the SHO Hamiltonian consists solely of discrete energies En = (n + ~) liwo, and all of the corresponding eigenfunctions satisfy the boundary conditions t/Jn(X) -> 0 as x -> Â±oo. 470 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I Because this Hamiltonian is Hermitian, we can expand any physically-admissible wave function \\II(x , t) (that satisfies these boundary conditions) in the set of its eigenfunc- tions . According to Eq. (10.1000), the expansion of a funct ion \\II(x,t) in this basis looks like oc \\II(x, t) =L Cn(t)1/'n(x). n=O (10.101) (1O.102a) (1O.102b) We implemented just such an expansion for a non-stationary state of the SHO in Example 9.6: the state represented by [Eq. (9.129a)] \\II(x, t) = ~ ( ~)1/4 e-f32 x2/2 [e-iwot/2 + J2/3xe-3 iwot/2] 1 .1. ( ) - iEot/\" + 1 .1. ( ) - iEl t/\"= J2'f'1l X e J2'f'1 x e . The second line in Eq. (10.102) is the expansion of \\II(x, t) in the complete set of SHO eigenfunctions. [The state function (1O.102a) was so simple that we could determine the coefficients in (1O.102b) by inspection; later in this section we 'll derive a straightforward procedure for calculating these coefficients when this simple gambit fails .] Note that for this particular state function, all but two of the expansion coefficients are zero. We can exploit the completeness of the eigenfunctions {1/'n (x)} to expand more complicated SHO wave functions, such as the (initial) wave packet (1O.103a) This particular function has even parity, so although its expansion (10.101) does contain an infinite number of terms, the coefficients cn(t) for all odd n must be zero. [Only even-parity functions can appear in the expansion of an even function ; just one odd-parity function on the right-hand side of (lO.I03b) would befoul the purity of the parity of \\II(x , t) .] So for this state, the complete set expansion becomes oc \\II(x, t) = L C,,(t)1/'n(x) . n=O (even) [even-parity \\II] (l0.103b) Aside: On the Choice of a Complete Set for Expansion. A remarkable feature of completeness is its versatility: the Hermitian operator that defines the basis set in which we expand a state function need not have anything to do with the system whose state function we expand. For example. we could use the compete set of SHO eigenfunctions to expand a state function of some other system-say, a stationary- state wave function of the symmetric finite square well (Â§ 8.7-8.8), or e free-panicle wave packet such as the Lorentzian 1 a \\II(x, 0) = --2--2 ' 1rX + a The form of the expansion of (lO .I04a) is ( free-particle ) = '\" cn(t) ( eigenfunction of ) wave packet LJ the SHO Ham iltonian 1\\11 eiKp.nfull <:tiol1~ (10.1040) (1O.I04b) This feature of completeness isn't magic ; completeness is a mathematical property of eigenfunctions, not tied to the systems whose states they may represent. Sec. 10.7 Consequences of Hermiticity II: Completeness and Closure 471 Question 10-22 Could we expand a wave function of the asymmetricfinite square well in the set of eigen- functions of the SHO Hamiltonian? Why or why not? How about a wave function of the infinite square well? A Familiar Analogue Does completeness seem remote, abstract, too mathematical to visualize? Would you like a picture? In discussing orthogonality (Â§ IO.6), I noted an analogy between the mathematics of eigenfunctions and that of vectors. Look at Fig. IO.3, where a vector [a directed line segment in geometrical space (313 ) ] is expanded in the set of unit vectors {ex, ey,ez }. Any (continuous) directed line segment V can be so expanded, (IO.I05) because the set {ex, ey , ez} is complete. These three unit vectors, in fact, comprise a basis for the expansion of the arbitrary vector V. The \"expansion coefficients\" cx , cy, and Cz are called the components of V and are determined as projections of this vector on the unit vectors, the elements of the complete set: Cx = ex' V cy=eyÂ·V c, = ez ' V. (IO.106a) (IO.I06b) (IO.I06c) This analogy is the origin of the use of the word \"projection\" for the expansion coef- ficients cq(t) in the expansion of \\II in the complete set {Xq}, Eq. (10.99). Drawing further on this analogy, physicists sometimes call these coefficients the components of \\II on the eigenfunctions {Xq}.23 ------ I I I I II - - - - - - - - __ .Y Figure 10.3 A vector and its components on the complete set of axes of a Cartesian (rectangular) coordinate system. 23There is more here than meets the eye. As 1 have remarked before. quantum states can be represented by \"vectors\" in an abstract \"linear vector space\" called Hi/bert space. Hilbert space is not a three-dimensional space like the one we live in. but the analogy between the two provides a powerful geometrical interpretation of quantum mechanics. For a readable introduction to this viewpoint . see Â§ 4.4 of Introductory Quantum Mechanics by R. L. Liboff (San Francisco: Holden-Day. (980) . For the whole story. see Principles of Quantum Mechanics. 4th ed. by P. A. M. Dirac (Cambridge: Oxford University Press. 1970). 472 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I Determination of the Expansion Coefficients In the vector analogy to the eigenfunction expansion (10.99), the coefficients cx, cg , and c, are determined from V and from the elements of the basis set in which the vector was expanded. In the Fourier series analogy (10.98), the coefficients an and b.; were determined from f(x) and from the elements of the set {cos (27Tnf) ,sin (27Tnfn. So it should come as no surprise that the coefficients cq(t) in the expansion of iII in {Xq} are determined from the state function and the eigenfunctions in this set (see Table 10.8). In fact, the equation for these coefficients, which we'I1 now derive, bears a suggestive similarity to those for the components of a vector and for the Fourier coefficients.

We can do so by exploiting what we know about the eigenfunctions in this expansion: they are orthonormal, i.e., (10.107) How can we make an orthogonality integral appear in the eigenfunction expansion? Easy: we first multiply the expansion (on the left) by X;, : X;, iII = L CqX;'Xq. all q We then integrate both sides of Eq. (10.108) over all space, and voila! J X;,iIldv = LC q J X;'Xqdv . a ll space all q a ll space In Dirac notation Eq. (1O.109a) is (Xq' IiII) = LCq(Xq' I Xq). all q (10.108) (1O.I09a) (1O.I09b) (10.110) Now, the overlap integrals on the right-hand side are equal to Kronecker delta functions Oq,q\" But each of these Kronecker delta functions equals zero except for Oq,q = 1. So this beast kills all terms in the sum over q except q = q', thereby isolating the coefficient cq' = (Xq' I iII). Dropping the unnecessary prime on the eigenvalue, we can write our result for the projection of iII on Xq as Iprojection of iII of Xq = cq = (Xq IiII) I Sec. 10.7 Consequences of Hermiticity II: Completeness and Closure 473 Note that this result isn't restricted to wave functions: we can apply it to any function f(x) that obeys the same boundary conditions as the eigenfunctions {Xq}: i.e., cq = (Xq I I). To illustrate this important result, here are the coefficients in the expansions in Eqs. (10.100) of one- and three-dimensional wave functions: Cq(t) = I: X;(x)'l1 (x , t) dx (X; r (21r cq(t) = io in in X;(r)'l1(r, t) dv, (10.1110) (10.11 Ib) where in (10.1 lIb) the volume element in spherical coordinates is dv = r2dr sinOdO dcp. Question 10-23 Derive Eq. (l0.102b) from Eq. (10.1020) using the general relationship (10.110). To fully appreciate the awesome niftiness of Eq. (10.110) we'll have to wait un- til Chap. 12, where we'll use it to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for non-stationary states. Since that chapter, which is entirely devoted to eigenfunction expansions , is filled with applications of this procedure, I'll eschew further examples here. We have, after all, a bit more to cover in our sojourn through the mathematics of Hermitian operators. Closure The final property of the eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator is the one of the least obvious relevance: closure. Closure is intimately related to the other properties we've examined, orthogonality and completeness (see Pblm. 10.5), but it has a very odd form. One viewpoint on the closure relation is that it's a way to represent the Dirac Delta function c5(x - x') in terms of the eigenfunctions of an operator Q: L Xq(x)Xq(x') = c5(x - x') all q closure (10.112) Notice carefully that in each term in the sum in (10.112), the eigenvalue q appears twice: once as a label on the eigenfunction X with argument x and a second time on the same eigenfunction but with the argument x'. Question 10-24 The Dirac Delta function o(x - x') acts in an integral J~ooo(x - x')f(x') dx' to \"pluck out\" the value f(x) (see Appendix L). Prove that j\"\" L Xq(x)Xq(x')f(x') dx' = f(x) . -oc all q We won't often use the closure relation. But this property is important in more advanced treatments of quantum theory, so I include it for (ahem) completeness. 474 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I Where's the Physics? The major results of this chapter are the properties we've been discussing in the past two sections. They are summarized in Table 10.9, where I have also included the results for continuous eigenvalues so you'll have them if you need them. (If you haven't been reading the footnotes, ignore this column .) Before leaving these properties, which you should memorize, I must stress one point. Way back in Chap. 3, Postulate I declared that any quantum state could be rep- resented by a wave function \\II(x, t) . It is extremely important to appreciate that the collection of coefficients {cq (t)} in the expansion of a state function in any complete set is merely an alternate way to represent this physical state. These coefficients contain precisely the same physical information as the state function. The wave function \\II(x, t) highlights the observable position , i.e., this function- the position probability amplitude-is especially well-suited to investigating probabilities, average values, and uncertainties of the observable x. Similarly, the set {cq(t)} highlights properties of the system related to the observable Q. For example, in Chap. 4, we first encountered the notion of multiple representations ofa quantum state. There we developed the momentum-space representation of a state, its momentum probability amplitude IP(p). In that Chapter, I emphasized that IP(p) contained no more or less physical information than the state function in the position representation, \\II(x, t) . Rather, the momentum-space function is just a way to represent that information that is particularly convenient for studying the momentum properties of the particle. In fact, as we'll see in Chap. 13, the coefficient cq(t) = (Xq I \\II) is a \"probability amplitude for the observable Q,\" just as \\II(x , t) is a probability amplitude for position. Thus we have the following alternative ways of representing the physical information about the particle in a particular quantum state: {Cq(t); all q} 1 information about Q \\II(x,t) 1 information about x Since there are a very large number of observables Q for any system, there are a huge number of alternative representations of that information . The three most important are the position, momentum, and energy representations. The latter will be introduced in Chap. 12. 10.8 FINAL THOUGHTS-AND A FINAL EXAMPLE: THE PARITY OPERATOR To review the many mathematical machinations I've introduced in this Chapter, I want to explore further the properties of a particularly important operator: ft. 24 We defined the parity operator in Eq. (10.68) by its action on an arbitrary function, 24The parity operator is peculiar in that, unlike p or it, it cannot be expressed as a function of i: and p. Instead, the parity operator is one of a class of symmetry operators. Symmetry operators play an important role in quantum mechanics when this theory is formulated in terms of a branch of advanced mathematics called \"group theory.\" (Other symmetry operators include translation, reflection and rotation; we'll study rotation operators in Volume II.) Nevertheless,the parity of a quantum state can be measured in the laboratory; in fact, the Chinese-American physicistsT-D Lee and C. N. Yang shared the Nobel Prize in 1957for demonstrating that parity is not conserved in all microscopic interactions (see Â§ 11.9 for the saga of the fall of parity conservation). Sec. 10.8 Final Thoughts-and a Final Example: The Parity Operator 475 TABLE 10.9 PROPERTIES OF THE EIGENFUNCTIONS AND EIGENVALUES OF A HERMITIAN OPERATOR Q.

Is n a valid quantum-mechanical operator, i.e., is it Hermitian? And what about a symmetric potential allows the eigenfunctions of its Hamiltonian to have definite parity, i.e., to be simultaneously eigenfunctions of the parity operator? We are now in a position to answer these questions. Question 10-25 The parity operator in three dimensions inverts a vector r through the origin. as TIf(r) = f( -r) . In rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates. the effect of this operator is TIf(x , y, z) = f( -x, -y, -z). What is the effect of TI in spherical coordinates. i.e.â€¢ what is TIf(r,8,lp)? Like most good quantum-mechanical operators, fI is linear: rt[Cdl (x) +c2h(x)] = Cdl(-X) +c2h(-x) = c1fIiI (x) + c2fIh(x) . (10.115) (10.116) (10.117a) (10.117b) And, like all good quantum-mechanical operators, it is Hermitian. The proof of the latter property is worth contemplating, for it illustrates yet another important problem-solving strategy. Example 10.13. Hermiticity of the Parity Operator This is one proof that is best not carried out in Dirac notation. The issue at hand is the question (10.118) 476 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I (10.119) Let's go to work on the left-hand side of (10.118), 1:llii(x, t) ITIli2(X, t) dx =1:llii(x, t)1Ii2( -x , t) dx. To prove (or disprove) Hermiticity, we must transform the integrand on the right-hand side of (10.119) into a form in which the parity operator acts on 1li1(x,t), i.e., a form that contains iii 1(-x , t) and iii 2 (x, t) . Can you see how to effect this change? Sure . .. just change the dummy variable of integration from x to -x (being very careful with the limits of integration when we do so): 1:llii(x , t)1Ii2( -x, t) dx =L- oo llii(-x, t)1Ii2(X, t) d(-x) = - i- oo [ITiii 1 (x, t)rIli2(X,t) dx . We now use the minus sign to interchange the limits of integration, obtaining 1:llii(x, t)ITIli2(X, t) dx =1:[ITiii 1(x, t)] â€¢ iii 2 (x , t) dx , which proves quite handily that IT is Hermitian. (10.1200) (10.120b) (10.121) So even though IT cannot be expressed in the form Q(x,p), it can represent a physically-measurable quantity . And it has all the accoutrements of a Hermitian operator: real eigenvalues and (as we'll see below) a complete set of orthogonal eigenfunctions that satisfy closure. Question 10-26 What is the adjoint of the parity operator? Question 10-27 The parity operator also has some other easily-proven properties. For one thing, A 2 A II = 1. Prove this property. Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of the Parity Operator Let's now solve the eigenvalue equation for the parity operator: nXq(x) = qXq(x), (10.122) where q, the eigenvalue, must be real. Our first stab at solving (10.122) might be to let IT act on the eigenfunction . At first glance, the result looks unpromising: Xq(-x) = qXq(x). (10.123) We need an equation both sides of which contain Xq(x) . We can change the sign of the argument on the left-hand side of Eq. (10.123) back to x by a second application ofn to both sides of this equation [since ITXq(-x) = Xq(x)], viz., (10.1240) Sec. 10.8 Final Thoughts-and a Final Example: The Parity Operator 477 We now use the eigenvalue equation (10.122) to let IT act on the right-hand side of (10.1240), obtaining Xq(X) = q2Xq(X). This means that q2 = I, which, since q must be real, means that q = Â±1. So the parity operator has only two, discrete eigenvaluesi''' ITXÂ±I(X)= Â±1 XÂ±I(X), (10. I24b) (10. 124c) in agreement with Eq . (10 .69) . Ergo , any function that is an eigenfunction of IT is either even or odd. Note carefully that this property of the eigenfunctions of the parity operator is not a consequence of the definition of that operator-although the glib way I have referred to \"even- and odd-parity functions\" earlier in this book may have led you to think so. Rather, it is a consequence of the Hermiticity of the parity operator. Note also that the above argument does not imply that all functions are eigenfunctions of IT. There is no reason why functions g(x) cannot exist such that ITg(x) =1= Â±g(x); indeed, we have seen several such functions in our study of one-dimensional systems with asymmetric potentials. The orthogonality of the eigenfunctions of IT means that the overlap integral of an even- and an odd-parity function is zero, i.e., (10 .125) More interestingly, completeness of the set of eigenfunctions {X+l' X-I} means that any function can be written as the sum of an even function and an odd function, i.e., f(x) = CtX+t (x) + C2X-t(X). [for arbitrary f(x)J (10 .126) This property is useful in a variety of contexts other than quantum physics, so it's worth investigating further. Question IG-28 Suppose f(x) does not have definite parity, and that this function and the eigenfunctions X+1(x) and X-I(X) in (10.126) are normalized . What must be the values of the expansion coefficients CI and C2? Derive expressions for the eigenfunctions X+1(x) and X-I (x) in terms of f(x). Parity and the Hamiltonian In Chaps. 8 and 9, we scrutinized several one-dimensional symmetric potentials-noting that their bound-state wave functions have definite parity, i.e., their Hamiltonian eigen- functions 1/JE(X) are eigenfunctions of ft. This situation is special; as we have seen, the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions of systems with asymmetric potentials, such as the half- infinite linear potential and the asymmetric square well , are neither even nor odd. In Â§ 9.4 we supported these observations with the proof of Proclamation 9.2, which stated that the bound-state eigenfunctions of a symmetric potential have definite parity . 25This derivation told us nothing about the eigenfunct ions Xq. In fact, it' s impossible to solve the eigenvalue equation (10.122) for an analytic form of these functions (as we could, say, the Hamiltonian eigenvalue equation for the simple harmonic oscillator) because of the peculiar nature of the parity operator. To each eigenvalue of IT there corresponds an infinite number of eigenfunctions; so the eigenvalues of IT are \"infinite-fold degenerate.\" 478 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I That proof appealed directly to the TISE for a symmetric Hamiltonian. But the reasons for this result are deeper even than the Schrodinger equation; they strike to the very essence of the nature of the system itself. To show you why, I want to reconsider this property from an operator viewpoint. In particular, I want to explore the commutation relation of the Hamiltonian and the parity operator-and its implications. To this end, we'll consider in succession the two terms in it, beginning with the potential operator. One way to express the symmetry (under inversion) of a symmetric potential is in terms of the function V(x), i.e., V( -x) = V(x) . (10.1270) How could we express this essential feature of the system as an operator equation? Well, the function V (x) is related to the potential operator, one of the two operators in the system Hamiltonian (see Chap. 5). In the position representation, V is the mathematical instruction: multiply by the function V(x). The statement (10.1270) of the symmetry of the potential involves an inversion of x through the origin, so it's not surprising that its operator expression involves the parity operator. Equation (10.1270) shows us that this operator commutes with V: since V(x) is symmetric, we can interchange V and IT at will, i.e.,26 ITV = VIT [IT, V] = O. [for a symmetric potential) (10. 127b) The commutator relation (10.127b) expresses the symmetry of the system in the operator viewpoint. But this is only half of the story: to see if the Hamiltonian commutes with IT, we must consider next the kinetic energy operator. Example 10.14. The Parity Operator and the Kinetic Energy Operator Our demonstration that the parity operator commutes with a symmetric potential operator may lead you to wonder if IT commutes with the kinetic energy operator. \"The form of this operator, T = p2/(2m) , suggests that we back up one step and ask whether IT commutes with p. In one dimension, p = -ilid/dx , and it's not hard to see that the order of operation of these operators is important. Since IT leaves the constant factor -iii unchanged, we have n' f ( ) 'lifl' df(x)p x = -1 -- dx =-iii [_ d~~)] =-pITf(x) . So the operators IT and p don't commute, i.e., ITp = -pIT. (10.128a) (1O.l28b) (1O.l28c) (1O.128d) But T enta ils two successive applications of p. From the form of Eq. (1O.128d), you might guess that the form of T causes this operator to commute with IT. Let's see: 26Be careful when working with operator equations such as (I0.127h); 'tis safest to let them act on an arbitrary function, as fiv f(x) = vfif(x). Be sure you understand why the left-hand side of this equation is V( -x)f( -x) instead of V( -x)f(x) . Sec . 10.8 Final Thoughts-and a Final Example: The Parity Operator 479 ITt = _I_IT\" 2m pp I AIIAA=--p P 2m I \" IIA=-pp 2m = tIT. You were right: IT and T do commute: [IT,t] = o. (1O.l29a) (10.129b) (l0.129c) (l 0.129d) (1O.12ge) We can now deduce the desired commutation relation for ft and the Hamiltonian of a system with a symmetric potential. Combining the result of Example 10.13 with Eq. (10.127b), we find I ftil = ilft ==> [ft, il] = 0 I [for a symmetric potential] (10.130) i.e., Rule The Hamiltonian of a system with a symmetric potential commutes with the parity operator. Question 10-29 Prove that if V(-x) i= V(x), then [H,IT] i= o. The central question of this section concerns the consequences of this commutation relation for the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. Let's act on such an eigenfunction with the operator equation (10.130): (10.131) The presence of ilft1/JE(X) on the right-hand side of (10.131) leads us to wonder: might the function ft1/JE(X) be an eigenfunction of il? To find out, look at the left-hand side of this equation. Using the TISE to simplify this side, we get ftil1/JE(X) = ftE1/JE(X) = E [ft1/JE(X)] , with which we can write Eq. (10 .131) as (10 .132) (10.133) Egad! Both functions 1/JE(X) and ft1/JE(X) are eigenfunctions of the operator il. with the same eigenvalue. But we know (from Proclamation 9.1, Â§ 9.4) that the (bound- state) eigenvalues of a one-dimensional, single-particle system are non-degenerate. Con- sequently, these two functions must be proportional to one another. Using q as the constant of proportionality, we can write 480 Chap. 10 Operators in Quantum Mechanics I (10.134) But this is just the eigenvalue equation of the parity operator, Eq. (10.124), and the proportionality constants are just the eigenvalues q = Â±l. This argument proves that the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions of a symmetric potential are simultaneous eigenfunctions of two operators, II and il:27 il1/Je(x) = E1/JE(X) ll1/JE(X) = Â±1/JE(X), Hamiltonian eigenvalue equation parity eigenvalue equation (10.135a) (lO.135b) This alternate proof of Proclamation 9.2 lays bare the essence of why stationary- state wave functions of a symmetric Hamiltonian have definite parity. We have seen that this property is an inevitable consequence of the fact that a symmetric Hamiltonian commutes with the parity operator. This example hints at a profound connection between the commutation relations satisfied by a pair of operators and the eigenfunctions of those operators. In the next chapter, we'll explore this relationship further, and later, in Part IV, we'll discover the remarkable implications of this connection for measurements on microscopic systems. ANNOTATED SELECTED READINGS Operators Don't limit your reading to my treatment of the mathematics and physics of operators. Nearly every quantum mechanics text written in the last 30 years has a chapter or so on this material; some of them are very good. One I particularly like is 1. Feynman, R. P., R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume III (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1970). The entirety of Feynman' s treatment of quantum physics is well worth your attention. Chap. 20 deals with operators and ranges over most of the material covered in more conventional texts. A particularly excellent treatment of the mathematics of quantum mechanical op- erators is 2. Jordan, T. F., LinearOperators in Quantum Mechanics, (New York: Wiley, 1969). Jordan's text emphasizes the mathematical foundations of quantum theory, but I think most of you will find it accessible and enlightening. Eigenvalue Equations and Completeness Many of the pivotal equations in quantum theory are eigenvalue equations. Eigenvalue equations and their solutions are a subject in themselves. Two fine sources for background reading on this (and related mathematical topics) are 3. Jackson, J. D., Mathematics/or Quantum Mechanics (New York: W. A. Benjamin, 1962). 4. Hylleraas, E. A., Mathematical and Theoretical Physics: Volume I, (New York: Wiley, 1970). For specific information on eigenvalue equations from a mathematical viewpoint, see Chap. 25. 27 you may be wondering why I didn't label these eigenfunctions with both eigenvalues, E and Â±l. Doing so isn't wrong, but neither is it necessary. If we know the energy, we can deduce the parity of the function, so the eigenvalue Â±1 is redundant. Note that the argument doesn't go the other way: knowledge of the parity of a particular Hamiltonian eigenfunction certainly does not enable us to deduce its energy. Annotated Selected Readings 481 The subject of completeness is fraught with subtleties. But complete sets of func- tions are at the heart of the mathematics of quantum physics, so such matters are critical. Regrettably, most serious treatments of this topic are at a very advanced level. The best treatment I know of is in 5. Cushing, J. T., Applied Analytical Mathematics for Physical Scientists (New York: Wiley, 1975). Chap. 4. EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS ... . . at times the intention is puzzling the discontinuities inexplicable .\" -The Endless Short Story by Ronald Sukenick I've saved several nifty problems on operators for Chap.

Unfortunately, most of the problems in this chapter are a bit dry and \"exercise-y .\" Sad to tell, to be a quantum physicist you must be a good operator mechanic, and that means lots of practice. Like practicing a musical instrument, prac- ticing quantum mechanics is sometimes a little tedious, but nearly always rewarding.

If) Answer parts [d) and [e) for the ground state of the infinite square welI. 10.5 An Incomplete Treatment of Completeness In Â§ 10.7 we discussed the mathematical property calIed completeness. There we learned that the set of eigenfunctions {Xq(x)} of an Hermitian operator Q is complete; i.e.; any (suitably well-behaved) function f(x) can be expanded in this set [c!, Eq. (10.99Â»), as f(x) = L CqXq(x) . all q The coefficients in this expansion are evaluated Ii la Eq. (10.110) as Cq = 1:x;(x')f(x') dx' . (10.5.1) (10.5.2) (10.5.3) Equation (10.5.1) is useful in practice once we know that a given set offunctions is complete, but it's awkward if we want to determine whether a particular set of funct ions is complete. For that purpose, we'd prefer a relationship expressed entirely in terms of the eigenfunctions, not in terms of a nameless \"arbitrary function.\" Happily, we can derive just such a relationship by inserting Eq. (10.5 .2) into the expansion (10.5 .1), to wit: f(x) = L joo X;(x')Xq(x)f(x') dx'. all q -oc Now, since f(x) is arbitrary, Eq . (10.5.3) can hold if and only if the eigenfunctions {Xq(x)} satisfy the closure relationship (10.1 12), LX;(x)Xq(X') = 6(x - x'), all q (10.5.4) where 6(x - z\") is the Dirac Delta function. So one way to check completeness of a set of functions is to see if they satisfy Eq. (10.5.4). Prove that the set of eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of a simple harmonic oscillator is complete, by showing that they satisfy (10.5.4) . Hint: First , use the integral [for Re a 2 > 0) (10.5.5) (10.5.6) to show that the normalized spatial functions for the SHO can be represented as definite integrals, viz., ( .)n 1/4 JOO t/Jn(x) = -t (mwo ) e/32 x2/ 2 e-t2/4+ it/3xtndt. 2vi(2n 1Tn !) 1Tn - oc 10.6 A Strange Way to Represent Operators Some operators are very complicated in their effect on functions. Perhaps the most extreme examples are the non-local operators, whose action on a function entails integrating the function over alI space. Any operator A, whether local or non-local, can be written as an integral over the product of the function it acts on and a two-variable function called the kernel. This is called the integralrepresentation of A and looks like Exercises and Problems 485 Af(x) =I: K(x, x')f(x') dx', (10.6.1) (10.7.1) where K(x, x') is the kernel of A . We have seen one example of an integral representation of an operator: the Fourier integral relations (4.48) and (4.49) are integral representations of the operators that determine the Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transforms of the functions on which they act. [al What is the kernel of the operator that creates the Fourier transform of a (normalized) funct ion f(x)? [bl What is the kernel in the integral representation of the unit operator I? [cl Show that the integral representation of the linear momentum operator (for a one- dimensional system) is iii d~'6(x - x'). 10.7 The Time Reversal Operator In the quantum theory of scattering of elementary particles. an important role is played by a most peculiar operator. The time reversal operator T is akin to the parity operator of Â§ 10.8 in that it acts on the variables in coordinate- and momentum-space wave functions. In particular, this operator changes x into +x and pinto -p; these changes correspond to a \"time reversal\" t -> -t : { X -> x p-> -p In high-energy physics, an important property of scattering processes is invariance of the physical properties of a system under time-reversal. The effect of T on a state function is to produce a function that represents the same state evolving backward in time. For example, the mean value of the linear momentum in a \"time reversed \" state TiJI is (TiJll jJ ITiJI) = -(iJll jJ I iJI). [al Prove that the effect of T on the state function of a system iJI(x, t) is TiJI(x, t) = iJI*(x, t). [bl What does T do to the momentum-space wave function lI>(p) = F[iJI]? [cl Prove that T is anti-linear.

Where would that thrill be if I had been as definite as a timetable? I ask only a little patience. Mr. Mac. and all will be clear to you. -Sherlock Holmes in The Valley of Fear by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Like a weevil in a tin of flour, the commutator lurked throughout Chap. 10; every time we considered more than one observable, commutators appeared. Thus , in Example 10.6 (Â§ 10.3) we learned that whether the commutator of two Hermitian operators is nonzero determines whether their product is I-Iermitian. And, most strikingly, in Â§ 10.8 we discov- ered that for a symmetric one-dimensional system , the existence of bound-state spatial functions with definite parity is intimately tied to the commutator of the Hamiltonian and the parity operator. In this chapter the commutator comes into its own. First, we'll investigate simulta- neous eigenfunctions and their origin in the commutativity of certain Hermitian operators (Â§ 11.1), generalizing the remarks at the end of the last chapter. Next, we'll master the manipulation of commutators in algebraic expressions (Â§ 11.2-11.3). Then, for the piece de resistance, we'll return to uncertainty principles. These principles are among the most powerful and general results of physical theory, for they express fundamental limitations on our ability to acquire through measurement knowledge about two or more observables. As we'll discover in Â§ 11.4-11.5, these physical limitations are a direct consequence of a rather abstract mathematical question: do the operators that represent the observables being measured commute? The commutator does more than limit our knowledge of the microworld; it appears in conservation laws (Â§ 11.5-11.6). The form and structure of conservation laws in quantum physics differs strikingly from those of classical physics , as you might expect since we abandoned trajectories in Chap. 2. Yet, there is a connection between these theories: the Correspondence Principle. Last seen in Â§ 5.7, the Correspondence Principle (as we now know it) tells us that we relate measurable quantities of microscopic systems to their analogs in the macroscope via expectation values. But physics is the study not just of physical quantities but also of laws and relationships between these quantities . In this chapter the commutator will lead us to the connection between the laws of quantum and classical physics . This result, called Ehrenfest's Theorem (Â§ 11.7), is one of the most satisfying strands in the beautiful tapestry of quantum mechanics. To bring to a close our exploration of operators in quantum physics we'll look at one final uncertainty relation . Not all uncertainty relations are alike, and in Â§ 1l.8 we'll meet a most peculiar one, the energy-time uncertainty relation . We now know enough to understand the origin of this uncertainty principle and its role in physical phenomena such as the decay of excited states of atoms, a physical example I'll bring on stage in Â§ 11.8. 11.1 SIMULTANEOUS EIGENSTATES AND THE COMMUTATOR In Â§ 10.5 I introduced you to eigenstates : special states whose wave functions are eigenfunctions of one (or more) operator(s), e.g., 488 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II (11.1) What is special about an eigenstate of the observable Q is that in this state Q is sharp. That is, an ensemble measurement of Q will yield the value q and only that value; for this state, !::i.Q = 0 and (Q) = q. Chapter 10 ended on a somewhat enigmatic note, with a remark concerning state functions that satisfy eigenvalue equations like (11.1) for two operators . In Â§ 10.8 we proved that such eigenfunctions exist for the operators if and ft if and only if the potential operator V in if = t +V commutes with ft. This, in turn, happens if and only if V(x) is symmetric. Generalizing this example, we can define a simultaneous eigenstate as one whose state function is an eigenfunction of two (or more) operators. For observables Q and R, we could label such a state function by the eigenvalues q and r in the eigenvalue equations and write these equations as (11.2)simultaneous eigenstate of Q and R QII1q ,r = qll1q.r Rill q, r = rill q,r' Don't forget that the state function 111q,r in Eqs. (11.2) is (implicitly) a function of time. For example, the (time-dependent) wave function that represents a stationary state of a symmetric one-dimensional potential satisfies the simultaneous eigenvalue equations if 111(x, t) = EII1(x, t) ftll1(x, t) = Â±1I1(x,t) . (l1.3a) (11.3b) In a simultaneous eigenstate, both observables Q and R are sharp, so (Q) = q (R) = r !::i.Q=O !::i.R=O. (l1.4a) (11.4b) In general, of course, the statistical quantities (Q), (R), !::i.Q, and !::i.R depend on time. But if, as in Eqs. (11.4), the state function used to calculate them represents a simul- taneous eigenstate of both observables, then these quantities are independent of time. [Nonetheless, we formally evaluate these quantities from the state function 111 at the same time. This seemingly pedantic point is important because of the implications of Eqs. (11.4) for measurement.] Question 11-1 Prove that Eqs. (11.4) follow from (11.2) for a simultaneous eigenstate of Q and R. The essential point of Eqs. (11.4) is that a \"simultaneous measurement\" of Q and R-one in which both properties are measured at the same time-yields uniquely the values q and r . To appreciate the physical significance of this remark, you'll have to wait until Chap. 13, where we confront the problem of measurement. But for a preview, look at Fig. 11.1, which is a generalization of our schematic for measurement of a single observable (Fig. 10.1).

Three quantum states are considered. The state in (a) is a simultaneous eigenstate of these two observables, so all members of the ensemble yield the same value of Q and the same value of R. The state in (b) is an eigenstate of Q but not of R, so measurement of the latter observable yields a distribution of values. i.e., the value of R is uncertain, In the state in (c), which is not an eigenstate of either observable, both measurements yield a distribution of results. Is this state a simultaneous eigenfunction of it and p? Of any two other observables? Explain your reasoning. Do All Pairs of Operators Define Simultaneous Eigenfunctions? The definition (11.2) of a simultaneous eigenstate raises two questions about any pair of observables Q and R: I. Is a particular state a simultaneous eigenstate of Q and R? 2. Do any simultaneous eigenstates of Q and R exist? In an important sense, the second of these questions is more general than the first, which can easily be answered by checking whether or not the particular function satisfies Eqs. (11.2) [cf, Question 11-2]. The answer to the second question depends on the operators Qand R. We know, for example, that there exist simultaneous eigenfunctions of ft and if (for a symmetric potential) [see Eqs. (11.3)]. But there do not exist simultaneous eigenfunctions of x and p. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, for any state of any system the uncertainty product of x and p is positive: ~x(t)~p(t) ~ ~1i > O. (11.5) This principle explicitly prohibits the existence in nature of states in which x or p (or both) is sharp; i.e., a simultaneous eigenfunction of x and p cannot represent a physi- cally realizable quantum state. Clearly, not all pairs of observables have simultaneous eigenstates. 490 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II This observation raises several questions . What property of x and p proscribes the existence of simultaneous eigenfunctions of these operators? And what property of other pairs of operators allows the existence of simultaneous eigenfunctions? Given arbitrary observables Q and R, how can we ascertain whether or not simultaneous eigenstates of Q and R exist? We already have several clues. We know (from Â§ 10.8) that the existence of simul- taneous eigenstates of il and rt hinges on whether or not [il, fI] = 0; this commutator is zero if V(x) is symmetric, in which case such eigenstates do exist, but it's nonzero otherwise. We also know (from Chap. 5) that x and p, which don't support simultaneous eigenfunctions, don't commute , for [Xlp] = ilil. Could it be that only operators that commute support simultaneous eigenfunctions? You bet it could. The Commutator Is the Key One of the most important theorems in quantum mechanics states conditions for the existence of simultaneous eigenfunctions: Proclamation 11.1 A complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of two Hermitian operators exists if and only if the operators commute. Note carefully that this statement says two things: I. Operators that commute define a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions. 2. Two operators that share a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions commute . Before discussing this proclamation, let's write down its mathematical form. If Hermitian operators Qand R obey the commutation relation [Q,R] = 0, (11.6) then they define a set of functions {Xq.r}, each element of which satisfies the equations QXq.r = qXq,r RXq.r = rXq,,\" (11.7a) (11.7b) Moreover, the set {Xq,r} is complete, so any well-behaved function lIt can be expanded asl lIt = L L Cq ,,Â·Xq ,1Â· all q all r [ expansion in complete set ] of simultaneous eigenfunctions (11.8) 1In writing such expansions, be careful not to drop any variables on the right-hand side. Any inde- pendent variables on which 111 depends that are not variables of the eigenfunctions Xq.,Â· must appear in the coefficients Cq ,1\" Usually, this means that these coefficients depend on time, as in Eq. (11.10), Another com- mon situation will surface in Volume II. where we'll study quantum states of a particle in three dimensions. In spherical coordinates. the wave functions for such states depend on r, 0, and cP, and we often expand these wave functions in sets that are complete in (J and cP but not r. In such expansions. the coefficients depend on r and on t. Sec. 11.1 Simultaneous Eigenstates and the Commutator 491 The coefficient cq,r is the projection of'lJ on the eigenfunction Xq,r' Aside: The Importance of Completeness. The completeness of the set of simul- taneous eigenfunctions defined by two commuting operators is a crucial feature of Proclamation 11.1 and is often overlooked or misunderstood by novice quantum me- chanics. The existence of a single simultaneous eigenfunction of two operators is no guaranteethat the operatorscommute. The most famous such counterexample occurs in the study of the orbital angular momentumoperator L. This is a vector operator. i.e.â€¢ it has three component operators. t; t.; and i.; No two of these commute; e.g.â€¢ [Lx,Ly ] =I o. Yet. there exists one quantum state in which Le, L yâ€¢ and L ; are sharp: the state in which the orbital angular momentum is zero. But a completeset of simultaneous eigenfunctions of any two component operarors-s-L, and t.; say-<loes not exist. We will find out why such counterexamples exist in Â§ 11.4. where we will connect the commutator to uncertainty relations. And we will investigate L and its properties in Volume II. We can evaluate the coefficients in the expansion (11.8) from the state function via our usual expansion (l0.109b), Cq,r = (Xq,r I'lJ). (11.9) These coefficients depend on time. For example, the wave function of a single particle in three dimensions depends on three spatial variables r (z, y, and z in rectangular coordinates; r, 0, and if> in spherical coordinates) and on time. We can expand such a function, 'lJ(r, t), in a complete set {Xq,r(r)} of eigenfunctions of (commuting) operators Q and Rthat act on functions of r, i.e., 'lJ(r, t) = L L cq.r(t)Xq,r(r) . all q all r The projection cq,r(t) of lIter, t) on Xq,r is, according to Eq. (11.9), cq,r(t) = J X;,r(r)lIt(r, t) dv . all space (11.10) (lUI) In the next chapter we'll explore the uses and interpretation of Eq. (11.11). For now, just note the time dependence of the projections, cq,r(t), and the simple extension of Eq. (10.110) to get (11.9). Argument: The proof that commuting operators define a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions is rather abstract and convoluted; rather than reproduce it here, I'll refer the curious to more advanced texts.? But I do want to show you the proof of the other side of this theorem, that two operators that share a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions necessarily commute. This proof illustrates techniques of operator algebra of great power and applicability. This demonstration hinges on the meaning of completeness and commutativity and on a simple consequence of the equations satisfied by the functions Xq,r' Consider what 2Actually. this proof is not too hard if we are dealing only with non-degenerate eigenvalues. If we operate on the eigenvalue equation QXq = qXq with R and use the (assumed) commutativity of the two operators. we obtain Q[RXq] = q[RXq] . Now, if q is non-degenerate. then the function RXq must be proportional to Xq. and the proportionality constant is just the eigenvalue of R. i.e.â€¢ RXq = rXq . This proves that Xq is also an eigenfunction of R. No such simple argument. however. can cope with the common case of degenerate eigenvalues. For details, see Â§ V.7 of Elementary Quantum Mechanicsby D. Saxon (San Francisco: Holden-Day. 1968). 492 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II happens when we apply the operator [0,il] to one of the simultaneous eigenfunctions of 0 and R: (11.12) Because Xq,r satisfies the eigenvalue equations (11.2), the operators on the right-hand side of (11.12) yield [0,il]Xq,r = qrXq,r - rqXq,r, = (qr - rq)Xq,r' (l1.I3a) (l1.I3b) But numbers commute. So the commutator of two commuting observables \"annihilates\" any simultaneous eigenfunction of its constituent operators, [O,il]Xq,,Â· = O. (11.14) I hope you can see that Equation (11.14) does not, in itself, prove that the operators oand il commute. Remember that to ascertain whether or not two operators commute, we must let their commutator act on an arbitrary (physically-admissible) state function 'I1 and see if the result is zero: [0, il]'I1 ~ o. (11.15) It is at this point that the completeness of the set of functions {Xq,r} comes in handy: we can expand the state function 'I1 ala Eq. (11.8) and insert the result into (11.15), viz., [0, il] L L Cq,rXq,r J: o. all qall r (11.16) The commutator doesn't affect the expansion coefficients-they're just complex numbers- so this operator slides through to the eigenfunction, giving L LCq,r[O,il]Xq,r J: O. a ll q all r (11.17) But according to Eq. (11.14), each term on the left-hand side of (11.17) is zero. Hence the sum is zero and we conclude that i.e., 0 and il commute. Examples and Counterexamples [O,il] = 0, (11.18) Q . E. D, We will encounter lots of examples of commuting operators and their simultaneous eigenfunctions for two- and three-dimensional systems in Volume II. For instance, the Hamiltonian of the hydro~en atom, which consists of one electron and one proton, com- mutes with the operator Â£2 that represents the square of the orbital angular momentum of the electron with respect to the proton . Consequently there exists a complete set of stationary states-eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian-that are also eigenfunctions of iÂ». The wave functions of these simultaneous eigenstates represent the familiar atomic or- bitals (Is , 2s, 2po, etc.) that you probably studied in high school chemistry. These eigenfunctions, and their counterparts for orbitals of other atoms, are the building blocks of the quantum mechanics of atomic and molecular physics . For now, though, our principal example of a pair of commuting operators is IT and the Hamiltonian of a symmetric potential. In Â§ 10.8 we showed that IT and the Sec. 11 .1 Simultaneous Eigenstates and the Commutator 493 Hamiltonian of a SHO commute , and we discussed the corresponding complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions, {1Pn (x); n = 0,1,2, . . . }. The form of the expansion of an arbitrary wave function 111(x, t) in this set is slightly simpler than Eq. (11.8) because it requires only one summation , i.e. DC 111(x, t) = L en(t)1Pn (x) . n=O (11.19) Formally, the general result (11.8) prescribes a second summation over all allowed eigen- values of IT: -1 and +1. But for this system such a summation would be redundant , because each Hamiltonian eigenfunction 1Pn(x) has definite parity, even or odd.3 Be careful not to generalize too hastily. Simplifications such as the elimination of a summation in (1 1.19) are rare, and one must be wary of blithely throwing away summations in an expansion of a wave function in a set of simultaneous eigenfunctions. In general, one should live by the following rule: Rule When expanding a function in a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of two (or more) commuting operators, sum over all eigenvalues of all observables. In our investigation into continuum states we encountered another pair of commut- ing operators: T and p. For example, the potential of a free particle is zero, so if. = T. Hence the Hamiltonian commutes with p, and these commuting operators define the simultaneous eigenfunctions 1PE (x) = _l_e- iPx/h ,P V21rn by the eigenvalue equations\" JI could. of course. be tiresomely pedantic and write Eq. (11.19) as +1 \\lI(x ,t) = L L CE,q(t)1/JE(X). a ll Eq=-I (11.20) I would then note that for even-parity Hamiltonian eigenfunctions the coefficient CE, -I = 0 and for odd-parity eigenfunctions, CE. + I = 0, which would lead me back to a single summation, over n . 4If you read the footnotes in Chap. 10 concerning expansions in a complete set of eigenfunctions with continuous eigenvalues. you know how to write such an expansion for { 1/JE,I'(X)}. We integrate rather than sum over the eigenvalues p. We need not integrate over E because the free-particle equation E = p2 / 2m . establishes a correspondence between the values of p and the energies E. (This correspondence is not, however. one-to-one.) Consequently if we integrate over p from -00 to +00 we are assured of picking up all the eigenfunctions in the set {1/JE,p(X)}. (That is to say. the index E on these eigenfunctions is, for this system. redundant.) The complete set expansion, is. of course, just the Fourier integral for a wave packet in terms of the momentum-space amplitude oI>(p). As I noted in Chap. 10, this momentum-space state function appears in the projection c,,(t) of \\lI(x , t) on 1/JE,p(X). 494 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II WE ,p(X) = P'lPE,p(X) il'l/JE,p(x) = E'l/JE,p(X) where What Commutativity Does Not Imply (11.2Ia) (11.2Ib) (11.2Ic) Just as important as mastering the implications of the commutativity of two operators is knowing what this property does not imply. Readers new to quantum mechanics often incorrectly conclude that if Q and R commute, then all eigenfunctions of one operator-say, Q-are necessarily eigenfunctions of the other. But only under very special circumstances is this conclusion correct ,\" To see a simple, familiar situation where it is wrong, consider Table 11.1, which contains three quantum states of a one- dimensional simple harmonic oscillator. State 1 is stationary, so its wave function is a simultaneous eigenfunction of the energy and parity operators . The wave function for State 2 is a linear combination of two even-parity stationary-state functions: the wave functions for the ground state and for the second excited state. State 2 is not, of course, an eigenstate of energy, but because of the particular stationary states that make it up, it is an eigenstate of parity. So the wave function that represents State 2 is an eigenfunction of IT but not of il, even though these two operators do commute. Finally, the superposition of the ground and first excited states, State 3, is not an eigenfunction of either operator. My point is that the commutativity of two operators certifies only that simultaneous eigenfunctions of the two operators are there if you need them. This property says nothing about a particular state of the system ; such a state mayor may not be an eigenstate of one or both of the commuting operators. Finally, and in this regard, it's vital that you keep straight in your mind the difference between simultaneous eigenfunctions and a simultaneous eigenstate. The former need not be (and, in general, are not) state functions. The latter is a special quantum state whose wave function lIt is a simultaneous eigenfunction of two operators .

For more on this matter, see Chap. n.D of Quantum Mechanics by C. Cohen-Tannoudji, B. Diu. and F. Laloe (New York: Wiley. 1977). Sec. 11.1 Simultaneous Eigenstates and the Commutator 495 Clearly, the commutator plays a crucial role in determining the nature of possible quantum states of a microscopic system. (Any residual doubts on this matter can be dis- pelled by peeking ahead to Â§ 11.4.) To become more agile manipulators of commutators, let's take a (brief) detour into the algebra of these beasties . 11.2 EVALUATING COMMUTATORS: THE RIGHT WAY, THE WRONG WAY, AND THE EASY WAY A singer can shatter a glass with the proper high note. . . . But the simplest way for anyone to break a glass is simply to drop it on the floor. -Marius to Lestat in The Vampire Lestat by Anne Rice Commutators are ubiquitous; in our voyage through the microworld, we will meet them at every tum. So far, we've encountered only rather simple commutators. But to navigate the deeper, more complex waters to come, we must be able to \"evaluate\" a commutator- i.e., to reduce it to the simplest (operator) form. We might, for example, have to contend with the likes of [13,x 2 ] , [1', x], or even [Q,eR ]. The most challenging commutators are those involving operator functions, such as x 2 , 132 , or eR. We know from Â§ 10.2 how to subdue such operators: expand 'em in their power series [see Eqs. (1O.12HIO.13)]. And we know from Â§ 5.5 the rule for manipulating commutators, which, after all, are just operators: Rule Evaluate an operator expression by letting the expression act on a function of the variables in the constituent operators. If, for example, we want to prove, for arbitrary operators A and E the relation [A,E] = -[E,A], (11.22) we may be tempted to expand the left-hand side, then switch the order of the resulting products, viz., [A,E] = AE - EA =-(EA - AE) = -[E,A] . (11.230) (l1.23b) (l1.23c) This approach isn't wrong, but it fosters bad habits. In this section I'll show you safe and efficient ways to evaluate commutators, point out a couple of traps for the unwary, and provide useful tables of commutator relations . As you work through this section, please obey the above rule (even when, for purposes 496 Chap. 11 Operatori in Quantum Mechanics II of illustration, I violate it). After you have practiced (a lot) with commutator algebra, you will be able to confidently and correctly perform algebraic feats of legerdemain in the style of (11.23). Basic Commutator Relations We'll consider first commutator relations satisfied by arbitrary operators that mayor may not be Hermitian. (So I'll denote these operators by A, B, 6, ... .) Then we'll focus on commutator relations for Hermitian operators, i.e., those that involve x, p, and functions thereof. Table 11.2 contains most commutator relations you're likely to need. You can prove each of these operator equations by following the guidelines suggested above. TABLE 11.2 HANDY COMMUTATOR RELATIONS. [A, An] = 0 (I) [A,B] = -[B,A] (II) [A,cB] = c [A,13] (III) [A,(B+6)] = [A,B] + [A,6] (IV) [A,136] = [A, 13] 6 + 13[A,6] (V) [A,j(A)] = 0 (VI) Question 11-3 The order of operators is, as we know, crucial and must not be cavalierly changed. To iIlustrate, prove that the relation obtained by interchanging the order of operators in the second term on the right-hand side of Property V is not, in general, true. That is, prove that [A,.8C] :I [A,.8]C+ [A,C].8. (11.24) You can prove this either by general argument or by counterexamples. Under what condi- tions, if any, are the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (11.24) equal? Question 11-4 Prove that [A, [.8,C]] + [.8,[C,A]] + [C,[A,.8]] =0 . (11.25) As I noted above, the ringers in commutator algebra are relations involving operator functions, but we can conquer these using the power series expansions of the functions. For example, to prove Property VI, [A,](A)] = 0, we need only expand the operator ](A) ala Eq. (l0.13), using the coefficients bj of the series expansion of the function j(A) : 00 ](A) = L bjAj . j=O Sec. 11.2 Evaluating Commutators (11.26) 497 With this expansion, the commutator on the left-hand side of Property VI, when acting on an arbitrary function g(x), gives\" 00 [A,j(A)]g(x) = Lbj[A,Aj]g(x) . j=O (11.27) According to Property I, [A, An ] = 0 for any power n, so each term in (11.27) is zero. This proves Property VI. And so forth. Question 11-5 Prove that [A,B] = 0 Commutation Relations Involving x and p [B, }(A)] = O. (11.28) Most operators in quantum mechanics can be written as functions of x and p. So the most important commutation relations are those involving these operators and their powers . We can evaluate all such commutators using the properties in Table 11.2 and the fundamental relation I [x,p] = in! I (11.29) which we proved in Example 5.4. Example 11.1. A Commutator for the Linear Potential In the text and problems for Chap. 9 we saw the usefulness of the linear potential V (x) = ax, where a is a constant that depends on the particular system. If, in the course of applying this model to a physical system, we run into the commutator [il,T], how do we proceed? Well, since the Hamiltonian is il = T + V and the kinetic energy operator T = ji /(2m) commutes with itself, the commutator of these two operators trivially reduces to (11.30) One way to simplify the remaining commutator [x,p 2 ] is to expand p 2 and use Property V in Table 11.2, viz., [x,p2] f(x) = [x,pp] f(x) = [x,p]Pf(x) + p[x,p ]f(x) =2ihPf(x). (11.31a) (l1.31b) (l1.31c) So the commutator of il and T is actually a much simpler operator than its initial form suggests: [ . .] ih 'H.,T = -ap. m (11.32) 6For simplicity, I have assumed in this section that all arbitrary operators act on functions of x , But the relations we are proving all pertain to operators that act on functions of more variables, as we'll see in Volume II. 498 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II Always try to simplify complicated commutators as soon as they appear in problems. The operator on the right-hand side of (11.32) is much easier to work with than the one on the left-hand side. Machinations such as those of Example 11.1 are so common in quantum mechanics that a table of commutation relations involving these fundamental operators is a valuable time saver. For future reference, I've compiled such a compendium in Table 11.3.7 TABLE 11.3 COMMUTATOR RELATIONS INVOLVING THE POSITION AND MOMENTUM OPERATORS [x2,p] = 2ihx [x,p2] = 2ihp [x2,p2] =2ih(2xp-ihi) for arbitrary operator functions j(p) and g(x): [x,j(p)] = ih:/(p) [p,g(x)] = -ih ~g(x) for a Hamiltonian if. = T + V(x) : [ -u .] _ ili ;\",X - --p m [ . ] OV. \"H,p = ih ox 1 (I) (II) (III) (IV) (V) (VI) (VII) Question 11-ti Use Property IV in Table 11.3 to prove Property VI. Use Property IV to prove Property II. Can you prove Property IV? Question 11-7 Prove that for any power n, [. .n] .\" .n-lx,p = tnnp . (11.33) The easiest way to prove this relation is via a technique calIed mathematical induction. First prove that it is true for the lowest power, n = 1. Then assume it to be true for power n and prove that it therefore holds for power n + 1. (Since the relation is true for n = 1, it must be true for n = 2 and hence for all higher values of n, by the same \"stair-step\" argument.) 7Note carefully that the arbitrary functions in Properties IV and V are functions of one or the other of the operators x and p. Under some circumstances these properties apply to functions of both operators, such as h(x, p). But because x and p don't commute. the applicability of these properties depends on the nature of the function h(x, p). So be very careful if you ever have to work out a commutator involving such a function and want to use Properties IV and V. Sec. 11.2 Evaluating Commutators 499 Trouble with Commutators Mulling over Example 11.1, you may have wondered , \"Why on earth does he persist in cluttering up derivations such as Eqs. (11.31) with arbitrary functions? Surely so simple a derivation can safely be performed without lugging along f(x).\" Right you are. We could work through this derivation using operator equations with minimal chance of error if, as in (11.31), we work at a rather high \"level of abstraction .\" That is, if at no point do we introduce an explicit form for the instructions x or fi-a form such as p in the position representation (jJ = -ihd/dx) or x in the momentum representation (x = ihd/ dp). This example suggests a useful guideline for all operator manipulations, whether or not commutators are involved: Rule Whenever possible, manipulate operators as abstract entities rather than as explicit instruc- tions in a particular representation. To see this rule in action and to appreciate how ignoring it can be hazardous to the health of your solution, let's consider another example . Example 11.2. A Commutator for the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Suppose we need to evaluate [il,p] for the SHO Hamiltonian il = T + ~T1lW5x2. [Such an evaluation is a critical step in determining the constants of the motion of this system (see Â§ 11.5).] Let's first express the operators in this commutator in the position representation and let them act on a function f(x). Noting that T commutes with p, we begin with [il,p]f(x) = [V,p]f(x) = ~T1lWHx2,p]f(X). Getting explicit, we write the commutator on the right-hand side of (11.34) as [x2,p] f(x) = x2pf(x) - px2f(x) = - in{ x 2 :Xf(x) - :x[x 2 f(X)]}. The derivatives in (l1.35b) are easy to evaluate, e.g., (11.34) (l1.35a) (l1.35b) (11.36)d~[x 2 f(x)] = x 2 :~+ 2xf(x). We now have only to insert (11.36) into (l1.35b) to simplify the right-hand side of the latter to [x2,p]f(x) = -inx2 :~+ inx2 :~+ 2inxf(x) [x2,p ]f(x) = 2inxf(x). (11.37) (11.38) Substituting this simple result into the right-hand side of Eq. (11.34), we conclude (finally) that [ 0 _ - ] 'n 2 _H,p = t T1lWox. [for the SHO] (11.39) 500 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II Is all this work really necessary? I would argue that it is. Here (with trenchant commentary) is an example of the kind of trouble one might get into working this problem with operators in the position representation but no functions: [H .] [ 1 2 2 'Ii d ] okay (11.40a), p = '2T1lWoX , -t dx = _ iliT1lW~(x2~ _ ~X2) Bad judgment , but okay (l1.40b) 2 dx dx iii 2 ( 2 d ) oops!

(11.40c) because we were trying to manipulate derivatives as operators rather than manipulating derivatives of functions as functions. This is, obviously, the wrong way to evaluate a commutator.

Question 11-8 Evaluate the commutator of:i; and H for the SHO two ways (the \"right\" and \"easy\" ways). The bottom line in operator manipulations-as in all problem solving-is the theme I keep harping on: never proceed through algebra mindlessly, on autopilot. Instead, think at every step about what you are doing and the alternate paths open to you . If you solve problems this way you will learn more, have more fun, and be far less likely to wind up with the wrong answer. 11.3 OPERATOR MANIPULATIONS AND MATRIX REPRESENTATIONS Many and varied are the theorems of quantum mechanics. But few are the theorems you'll find in this book. Our focus is not on mathematical proofs but on quantum physics. Still, some theorems are so powerful, so useful, that they cannot be ignored. The one we'll prove in this section illustrates the interplay of various aspects of the mathematics of operators that we've examined in Chap. 10 and Â§ 11.1-11.2. 8 8The usefulness of this theorem will not be apparent until Volume II, where we'll learn how to solve problems so complicated that their SchrOdinger equation is not amenable to exact solution. Implementing these approximation methods is much easier if full use is made of Proclamation 11.2. Still, it' s a short proof. a useful exercise, so I recommend that you don't skip it. Sec. 11.3 Operator Manipulations and Matrix Representations 501 Consider two commuting Hermitian operators: Qand R such that Qt = Q and Rt = R [Q,R] =0 . (11.42a) (l1.42b) Suppose that X'l and X'l' are two distinct eigenfunctions of Q [i.e., with different eigen- values (q =1= q')] but that these functions are not eigenfunctions of R. Therefore, the only eigenvalue equations these functions satisfy are QX'l = sx, QX'l' = q'X'l'Â· (q' =1= q) (11.43a) (11.43b) We'll now prove that the matrix element of R between X'l and X'l' is zero: (X'l IR IX'l') = O. (11.44) Question 11-9 Prove that the matrix elementof Q between these eigenfunctions, (Xq I Q I Xq') for q =f:. q', is zero. Justify carefully and in detail each step of your argument. Equation (11.44) may seem magical, for Q, the operator that defines the functions in the matrix element (Xq I R I Xq')' has only the most ephemeral relationship to R, the operator that appears in this matrix element. Novices trying to prove that (11.44) follows from (11.42) sometimes muddy the waters by introducing a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of Q and R. Although not a foolish approach to the proof, this gambit isn't necessary, as the argument to follow will attest. First let's state our conjecture in words. Proclamation 11.2 The matrix element of an operator with respect to eigenfunctions of a second operator that commutes with the first is zero if the eigenvalues of the two eigenfunctions are different. Argument: To prove this claim , we must somehow develop an expression involving the matrix element (X'l I R I X'l'). The only connection between R and the functions in this braket is the commutation relation Eq. (11.42b). So a sensible first step is to sandwich the operator [Q, R] between the eigenfunctions X'l and X'l'. According to (11.42) the resulting Dirac braket is zero: (X'l I [Q,R] IX'l' ) = (X'l IQR- RQ IX'll) = O. The matrix element in (11.45) consists of two terms , (Xq IQR - RQ IXq') = (Xii IQR IXq') - (Xq IRQ IXql), (11.45) (11.46) each of which looks like it might be persuaded to yield a matrix element of Ronly. To get such a result we must eliminate Qfrom each braket in Eq. (11.46). This chore is rather simple , because the functions in these brakets are eigenfunctions of Q. To position this operator so it can act on its eigenfunctions, we use its Hermiticity, viz., 502 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II (11.47) Now, in the first term, QXq = qXq' We must be careful in removing the constant from this braket, for QXq appears to the left of the bar in this Dirac braket. Were q complex, its complex conjugate q* would emerge from the braket. But q is an eigenvalue of a Hermitian operator and hence is real. So this number emerges from the Dirac braket without change (see Property II of Table 10.4). In the second term, no such questions arise in dealing with QXq' = q'Xq\" Therefore, Eq. (11.47) becomes q(Xq IRIXq/ ) - q' (Xq IRI Xq') = o. Factoring out the matrix element common to both terms in (l1.48a) , we have (q - q')(Xq IR I Xq/) = O. (11.480) (l1.48b) But since the eigenvalues q and q' are different , their difference q - q' is not zero. This means that the matrix element must be zero: (Xq IRI Xq/) = O. (l1.48c) Q. E. D. Question 11-10 Do you understand how to use this result? Suppose you need to evaluate the matrix ele- ment of the parity operator between two distinct simple harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions, (tPn IIT ItPn')' Explain in detail how to apply Proclamation 11.2 to this problem. Matrix Representations of Operators Another way to express Proclamation 11.2 is to say \"the off-diagonal matrix elements of Rwith respect to eigenfunctions of Q, with which it commutes, are zero.\" Implicit in this statement is the notion of representing an operator by a matrix , a particular arrangement of the Dirac brakets (Xq I R I Xq')' When we say a matrix \"represents\" an operator we mean that the matrix contains the same information as the operator, albeit expressed in a different way. The idea of matrix representations of operators originated with Heisenberg, who formulated quantum theory as matrix mechanics.' It achieved full flowering with Dirac, who formulated quantum theory using linear algebra in a vector space, an approach that leads inexorably to matrices. It is easy to see the genesis of this idea. Each Dirac braket (Xq I R I Xq') is a (complex) number that can be uniquely labelled by the quantum numbers q and q'. Let's call this number Rq,q\" Collect together all such matrix elements-by constructing all possible Dirac brakets using all elements of the complete set of eigenfunctions {Xq}-and arrange these numbers into a matrix: (~'\" Rql ,q2 Rql ,q3 OJ Rq2.ql Rq2,q2 Rq2,q3 ... R- Rq3.Q2 Rq3,q3 (11.49)- Rq3,ql 9For accessible treatments of matrix mechanics, see, for example, Chap. 2 of Quantum Mechanics by H. Hameka (New York: Wiley, 1981) and Chap. II of Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by B. Dicke and D. Wittke (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1960). Sec. 11.3 Operator Manipulations and Matrix Representations 503 (11.51) Notice that the eigenvalue to the left of the operator is the row index of the matrix and the eigenvalue to the right is the column index. The matrix R is called the matrix representation of R with respect to the eigenfunctions of Q.lO By the way, there is nothing special about the set of eigenfunctions with respect to which we define the matrix R; a huge number of different matrix representations of a given operator can be constructed, by simply choosing different sets of eigenfunctions. In terms of the matrix representation (11.49), Proclamation 11.2 takes on its most elegant form: I [Q, R] = 0 =} R is diagonal I (11.50) To see a typical matrix representation, let's write down the representation x of the position operator x for the simple harmonic oscillator with respect to the eigenfunctions of ii, the functions 'l/Jn(x). Each element of this matrix is a Dirac braket of the form ('l/Jn Ix I 'l/Jn') = I: 'l/J~(x)x'l/Jn'(X)dx. So the matrix representation of x with respect to the eigenfunctions of ii looks like!' (\"po Ix I'l/JI) ('l/JI Ix I'l/JI) ('l/J2 Ix I'l/JI) ('l/Jol xl'l/J2) ('l/JI 1 x I'l/J2) ('l/J2I xl'l/J2) 1 (11.52) Question 11-11 Use Table 9.7 to evaluate the integrals in x. Is this matrix diagonal? Question 11-12 Write down and evaluate the matrix representation of x 2 for the SHO with respect to the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. Introducing this topic, I said that the matrix representation of an operator contains the same information as does the operator. That information concerns the observable represented by the operator; in effect, this operator and its various matrix representations (with respect to different sets of eigenfunctions) are just different ways to represent the observable. But operators act on functions to yield, in general, other functions, lOIf we refer to the eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator as a basis. then we call the matrix R the matrix representation of R in the basis definedby Q. II Caveatemptor. In the matrix x, the quantum number for row I and column I is n = 0; but according to matrix notation. this element is labelled Xl , I. i.e.â€¢ Xl.I = (1/10 Ix 11/10)' So in this case the indices on each element of the matrix are not the same as the quantumnumbers that define the element being so labelled. Such complications often arise. and it is important to keep separate in your mind the indices on the matrix elements and the (physical) quantum numbers that label the eigenfunctions in the Dirac brakets. (In the quantum physics of a single particle in three dimensions or of a many-particle system. the situation becomes even more complicated. for a single index usually represents the values of many quantum numbers.) 504 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II while matrices multiply other matrices to yield still other matrices. So clearly, the way we solve a problem in quantum physics using the matrix representations of the relevant observables is very different than the way we solve the same problem using the operator representations of these observables . The most obvious parallel between operator and matrix mechanics is the eigenvalue problem. For an observable Q, the operator eigenvalue equation, which we have discussed at length in this and the previous chapter, is For the matrix q the matrix eigenvalue equation is qX q = qKq, where X is a column vector-a matrix with only one column-that is the eigenvector -q of the matrix q with eigenvalue q. The Dirac formulation of quantum mechanics is powerful and beautiful, but it is also quite abstract. So we won't pursue matrix representations further in this book. 11.4 COMMUTATORS AND UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLES In Â§ 11.2 we proved (Proclamation 11.1) that operators that commute share simultaneous eigenfunctions . If the state function \\If of a system is one such eigenfunction, then the system is in an eigenstate of the observables represented by the commuting operators, and \\If satisfies the corresponding eigenvalue equations (11.2). In such a state, both observ- abIes are sharp, so their uncertainties are simultaneously zero [Eq. (11.4)]. Therefore , in this state simultaneous ensemble measurements of these observables yield uniquely the eigenvalues of (11.2). This means that if operators Qand R commute, then the only uncertainty relation satisfied by the product of their uncertainties is the obvious one ~Q(t) ~R(t) ~ 0, [any state 1{1 of any system] (11.53) which follows from the definition of the uncertainty of an observable . But we have seen pairs of operators whose commutator is a non-zero constant. Our paradigm for this case is the pair x and p, whose commutator [x,p] equals ail. There exist no eigenstates of either operator, for the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle [any state 1{1 of any system] (11.54) prohibits the existence of such a state.P The Generalized Uncertainty Principle These examples hint at a connection between the commutator of two quantum-mechanical operators and the uncertainty relation for the corresponding observables-a connection l2The Dirac Della function 6(x- xo) is an eigenfunction of i: and the pure momentum function Xp(x) is an eigenfunction of p. For the former Ax = 0 and for the latter Ap = O. But since neither function is physically admissible, neither can represent a quantum state. Sec. 11.4 Oomrnutators and Uncertainty Principles 505 with profound and far-reaching consequences for laboratory measurements. Mathemat- ically, this connection is expressed by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which we'll discuss and illustrate (but won't prove) in this section.'P Generalized Uncertainty Principle (11.55) This rather forbidding inequality holds for any state of any system. Its truth hinges on only the definitions of the uncertainty and the expectation value and on properties of inequalities. The GUP says a mouthful. Its language is that of statistical quantities. On the left, we have the uncertainties 6.Q(t) = V(Q2) (t) - (Q)2 (t) 6.R(t) = V(R2) (t) - (R)2 (t). And on the right, we have the expectation value of the operator i [Q, R],14 (i[Q, R]) (t) = (if!Ii[Q,R]Iif!) , which, for a one-dimensional wave function, is (i[Q, R]) (t) = i1:if!* (x,t)(QR - RQ)if!(x,t) dx. (11.500) (11.56b) (11.57a) (11.57b) These statistical quantities are information concerning the (aggregate) results of simul- taneous measurements at time t of Q and R on a system in the state if!(x, t) . The uncertainty product 6.Q(t) 6.R(t) on the left-hand side of (11.55) must be positive or zero; the absolute value bars on the right side ensure that it, too, is non-negative. To further probe the generalized uncertainty principle, let's watch it in action. Example 11.3. The GUP Implies the HUP Suppose 0 and k in (11.55) are the familiar duo x and p. Then the operator in the expectation value on the right-hand side of the GUP is just i [0,k] = i [x,p] = i(ild) = -Iii. (11.58) So for these operators, the generalized uncertainty principle is !:lx !:lp ? 4I-li(III 1III)IÂ· (11.59) Since the state function III is normalized, (III I III) = 1, and Eq. (11.59) becomes the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, !:lx !:lp ? ~Ii. (11.60) 13you can find proofs in. for example, Â§ 6-12 of Quantum Mechanics by G. Powell and B. Crasemann (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1961) or in Â§ V.8 of Elementary Quantum Mechanics by D. Saxon (San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1968). For a critique of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle. see D. Deutsch , Phys. Rev. Lett., SO, 63 (1983) . 14The crypt ic i multiplying this commutator in the expectation value on the right-hand side of the GUP (11.55) is a formal nicety that ensures that the operator in this expectation value is Hermit ian. (In Table 10.5 I noted that the commutator of two Hermitian operators [Q, R] is not Hermitian. but that i [Q, R] is.) 506 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II Notice that nowhere in this example did I specify a particular state system. This simple derivation therefore proves that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, one of the three great ideas of quantum physics discussed in Chap. 2, is an inevitable consequence of the postulates of quantum mechanics. Just as uncertainty in a laboratory measurement on a microscopic system is a consequence of the wave nature of particles, so are uncertainty relations a consequence of the wave mechanics that describes their physics; both features of the microworld are intrinsic to nature. State-Dependent Uncertainty Relations The result of applying the GUP to x and p was a clean, quite general uncertainty relation. But for other operators the GUP may yield more complicated relations, expressions that depend explicitly on a particular quantum state. If [Q, R] is a non-zero operator not of the form (constant) 1. then the right-hand side of (II.55) may be zero even though [Q,R] i= O. This happens iffor the state 1If, the matrix element (1If I i[Q,R] I 1If) happens to be zero. This situation is a little tricky and warrants examination via a specific example. Question 11-13 Show that if W is an eigenfunction of the operator C = i [Q,k], then (wi i[Q,k] IW);6 O. Example 11.4. Uncertainties in Energy and Position for the SUO In Question 11.8 you discovered that the Hamiltonian if. of a one-dimensional simple har- monic oscillator does not commute with the position operator x. But unlike [x,p], the commutator of if. and x is not a constant times the identity operator i; rather, it' s propor- tional to the linear momentum operator: [ -U A] iii Art,Â» = --po m (11.61) At first glance, you might guess that the GUP (11.55) for Q = if. and k = x predicts a non-zero uncertainty product f:i.Ef:i.x. But it ain't necessarily so. To obtain an expression for this product, let's substitute (11.61) into the GUP, viz., (11.62a) (l1.62h) For a state represented by w(x , t), this uncertainty relation reads f:i.E(t) f:i.x(t) ~ 2~Ii: w* (x, t)pw(x, t) dxl Â· Clearly, if the mean value of p for the state W is zero, then the uncertainty relation (11.62) reduces to the trivial statement that the uncertainty product f:i.E( t) f:i.x(t) is not negative [Eq. (11.53)]. This happens, for example, if the state is stationary. In Â§ 9.9 we proved that for the nth stationary state of any symmetric potential, (P)n = 0 [Eq. (9.113)]. So if we have w(x , t) = 'l/Jn(x)e- i E n t / \" , then (P) on the right-hand side of Eqs. (l1.62) is zero, and 'n is inequality reduces to the uninformative utterance Sec. 11.4 [any stationary state of the SHO] (11.63) Commutators and Uncertainty Principles 507 But what if the state is not stationary? Consider, for example, a state of the SHO that is a superposition of two stationary states: (11.64) [You can find the eigenfunctions 'l/Jl(X) and 'l/J2(X) in Table. 9.6.] To determine the un- certainty product DoE(t) Dox(t) for this state we must , according to (11.62) , first evaluate (P) (t). [There is nothing new here; in Example 9.6 we calculated the mean momentum for a (different) non-stationary state of the SHO.] For the state (11.64) , we find (p) (t) = - ~~1i{3sin wot, (11.65) where , as usual, Wo is the natural frequency of the oscillator and {3 = Jrnwo/1i. The uncertainty product for energy and position at time t is therefore governed by the relation i.e., 71i2 {3 DoE(t) Dox(t) ~ 50m sinwot 1i 2{3 DoE(t) Dox(t) > 0.1400 - sinwot.- m (11.66a) (1 1.66b) How interesting. For this state, the mean value of p-and hence the energy-position uncertainty product-is not zero exceptat specialtimes t, those for which wot is an integral multiple of 71', i.e., DoE(t) DoX(t) ~ 0 for t = m71' Wo m = 0,1,2, . . . (11.67) At these special discrete times, therefore, E and x couldbe sharp . [But even at these times, Eq. (l1.66b) does not necessarily reduce to an equality.] We cannot tell, however, from the uncertainty relation alone whether they are sharp at these times. Let's verify that the uncertainty principle (11.66) is correct for this state. Doing so requires evaluating the left- and right-hand sides of this relation for the state (11.64)-by no means an impossible chore , but one that entails some algebraic contortions. Since the required manipulations are familiar, I won't fil1 in the details ; you can if you want to. The energy uncertainty is the square root of (11.68) We evaluate the inevitable expectation values from the wave function (11.64) using the TISE, obtaining 62 (E) = 25 1iwo = 2.481iwo. (11.69a) Notice that although the state is non-stationary, the mean value of the particle's energy is independent of time. The same is true of the mean value of the square of the energy, which turns out to be (E2) = 6.171i2W~. Using Eqs. (I 1.69) in (I 1.68) we find that for this state of the SHO, (11.69b) DoE = 0.14001iwo. (11.70) 508 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II Similar manipulations for the expectation value of x and x 2 lead us to the position uncertainty, the other factor in the product in (I 1.66): 14 (x) (t) = 50(3 coswot ( 2) 62 x = 25(32 ~ (.6.X)2(t) = 25~2 [62-1.96cos2wot] ~ .6.x(t) = 5~(3/62 - 1.96 cos- wot. The result of our explicit evaluation of the uncertainty product is n 2 (3 .6.E(t) .6.x(t) = (0.0280)- /62 - 1.96cos2wot. m (l1.7Ia) (l1.7Ih) (l1.71 c) (11.71d) (11.72) To illustrate the uncertainty relation (11.62), let's consider a particular time-say, t = 7r/(2wo). For this time, sinwot = 1 and coswot = 0, and the uncertainty product (11.72) becomes .6.E (t = 2:J .6.x (t = 2:J = 0.2205 n::. For this time the right-hand side of the uncertainty relation (11.66) is l!.-I(p) (t = ..2!:....)1 = 0.I400 n2(3. 2m 2wo m (l1.73a) (l1.73h) As expected, (l1.73a) is greater than (l1.73h), and the uncertainty relation is verified- for this particular time. (This verification does not, of course, constitute a proof of the generalized uncertainty principle.) Question 11-14 (To be done only if you feel you need practice evaluating uncertainties and expectation values.) Fill in the steps leading to Eqs. (11.73). [In Chap. 12 we'll learn a very easy way to evaluate expectation values of E and its powers; you might want to wait to fill in the steps of this example until then.) Aside: The Implications for Measurement. Our explicit results for the energy and position uncertainties shed some light on the question of what would happen were we to measure these observables at one of the special times t = m7r/wo, m = 0,1,2, . .. , when the uncertainty relation reduces to Eq. (11.67). At these times, coswot = I, so the position uncertainty equals the constant 1.55/(3 . The energy uncertainty is independent of time and so is equal to 0.1400 wo. Both uncertainties are non-zero, so even at these special times neither energy nor position are sharp-s-a fact we could not have deduced from the uncertainty relation (11.67). Question 11-15 Argue from the form of the state function that at no time could the position and energy uncertainties be zero. Sec. 11.4 Commutators and Uncertainty Principles 509 Compatible and Incompatible Observables The moral of Example 11.4 is that there is more to uncertainty relations than one might first expect. Any pair of observables Q and R falls into one of three categories, depending on the commutator of the corresponding operators Q and R. These cases and their consequences are summarized in Table 11.4. TABLE 11.4 SUMMARY OF CONSEQUENCES OF THE GUP. Compatible Incompatible [Q,k] = 0 [Q,k] =cl [Q,k]=s simultaneous exist don't exist may exist\" eigenfunctions complete set of simultaneous exists doesn't exist doesn 't exist eigenfunctions restrictions on l:!..Q > 0 & snÂ» 0 special states?\" uncertainties none simultaneous measurement possible not possible special statest of Q and R \"Complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions prohibited. \"\"Those for which (lit I i [Q, k] I lit) # o. t A single (exceptional) simultaneous eigenstate may exist. If Q and R commute, then the observables Q and R are said to be compatible; otherwise they are incompatible. Simultaneous eigenstates of two or more observables exist if (and only if) the observables are compatible. The uncertainty relation for two compatible observables tells us nothing; this relation is the trivial result (11.53). The uncertainty relation for incompatible observables, however, may limit the precision of simultaneous measurements of the observables; if the commutator of Q and R is a constant operator, then (rigorously) no states exist in which either observable is sharp. But if [Q, R] is a non-constant, non-zero operator, then the limits imposed by the GUP depend on the state with respect to which the uncertainties are evaluated. In this case there does not exist a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of Qand R, but there may exist one such state. Granted, this whole business is rather complicated. So spend a little time pondering Table 11.4, the examples of this section, and the marathon summary figure at the end of the chapter. Particularly important things to remember are: I. Only if two observables are compatible could we (in principle) measure their values simultaneously to infinite precision. 2. Even if two observables are compatible, the system may be in a state in which one or both is not sharp. 510 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II 11.5 CONSTANTS OF THE MOTION IN CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM PHYSICS In several pairs of observables that we've examined, one was the total energy E. Any observable that is compatible with E has a special status in quantum mechanics and is called a constant of the motion. By definition, an observable Q is a constant of the motion if the operator that represents it, Q, commutes with the operator that represents the energy, il: I [il, Q] = 0 =:::} Q is a constant of the motion I (11.74) You have learned (or, depending on your curriculum, you will learn) about constants of the motion of a macroscopic system in a classical mechanics course, where these quantities are sometimes called \"first integrals of the motion.\" But a constant of the motion for a microscopic system is a very different sort of creature, and the difference highlights a fundamental contrast between classical and quantum physics. This contrast, which will now become the dominant theme of this chapter, will ultimately return us to the Correspondence Principle, which connects classical and quantum physics. Constants of the Motion of a Macroscopic System In dealing with a complicated many-particle macroscopic system (twelve billiard balls on a table, for example) we usually cannot solve the classical equations of motion for the trajectories {ri(t), Pi(t), i= 1,2 ,3, .. . ,N} of all N particles. But we can still investigate the physics of the system, by focusing on particular observables,functions of r, and Pi, whose values do not change as the system evolves. These specialobservables are the classical constants of the motion of the system. The most familiar constant of the motion is the total energy. For a single macro- scopic particle in one dimension (one billiard ball on a wire), the energy is a func- tion of x and p and is sometimes written as the classical Hamiltonian H(x,p)-i.e ., E = H(x,p) = p2/(2m) + V(x). As time passes, the energy doesn 't change. In fact, we can prove (from Newton's Second Law) that av =0 at dE =0 . dt [classical physicsJ (11.75) Consequently E = H(x,p) is a constant of the motion-i.e., as has been known since 1847, the total energy of a conservative system is conserved.P So in classical physics knowledge of the constants of the motion leads to conservation laws. Not unexpectedly, the same is true in quantum physics (Â§ 11.6). Clearly the classical definition of a constant of the motion won't wash in quantum physics, because at no time can we precisely specify the position and the linear momen- tum (the trajectory) of a microscopic system. To clarify this difficulty, let's consider a specific state-say, a non-stationary state of a simple harmonic oscillator [e.g., (11.64)]. 15Notice that I specified that V does not depend on t, thereby limiting this discussion to conservative systems. In classical as in quantum physics, the energy of a non-conservative system in an arbitrary state is not conserved. For a discussion of constants of the motion and conservation laws in classical physics, see Chap. 1 and Â§ 2.6 of Classical Mechanics, 2nd ed. by H. Goldstein (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1980) or Chap. 2 of Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems, 2nd ed. by J. B. Marion (New York: Academic Press, 1970.) Sec. 11.5 Constants of the Motion in Classical and Quantum Physics 511 Such a state does not have an energy, a position, or a linear momentum, for none of these observables are sharp. So the classical description of one or another of these quantities as a \"constant of the motion\" is meaningless . To use this concept, we must re-define it in a way that is appropriate to the microworld and, yet, that remains consistent with the classical definition in the classical limit. As you'll see, Eq. (11.74) is the definition we need. Constants of the Motion of a Microscopic System The first thing to notice about the definition (l1.74) is that it makes sense. If it and Q commute, then there exist simultaneous eigenstates of energy and Q. In such a state, the energy and Q are sharp; i.e., their uncertainties, as calculated from W(x, t) at any time, are zero. Hence a measurement of Q will yield the eigenvalue q of W(x, t) regardless of when the measurement is performed; i.e., Q has a well-defined value that does not change as the system evolves. It is certainly reasonable to call such an observable a \"constant of the motion.\" If you'll flip back through this chapter, you'll find a couple of examples of constants of the motion for various systems : the linear momentum of a free particle, and the parity of a particle with a symmetric potential. And you'll see why the momentum of the simple harmonic oscillator is not a constant of the motion. Question 11-16 Is position a constant of the motion for a SHO? . .. for a symmetric square well? . . . for an asymmetric square well? Explain your answer in each case. Question 11-17 Prove that the energy of any conservative system is a constant of the motion of the system. (This exercise is easy and very important. Do it.) Question 11-18 Consider an electron in a hydrogen atom that is exposed to an external electromagnetic wave of frequency Wo and electric field strength Â£0. One term in the potential energy of this electron is V'(x,y,z) = eÂ£ozcoswot. Is the total energy of the electron a constant of the motion? Why or why not? The Importance of Constants of the Motion What are the consequences for the wave functions of the fact that constants of the motion exist? Because it commutes with the operator Q that represents a constant ofthe motion. there exists a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of these operators, {1/1E ,q(x)}. These simultaneous eigenfunctions describe the spatial dependence of stationary-state wave functions of the system , viz., 512 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II (l1.76) Such a wave function represents a simultaneous eigenstate of E and Q; it is separable because it is an eigenfunction of ic. Constants of the motion are important in quantum mechanics primarily because they define the quantum numbers that we use to label stationary states of systems such as atoms, molecules, solids, and nuclei. These are the states between which transitions occur in spectroscopic experiments. And they are the initial and final states of targets in collision experiments. To determine these vital constants of the motion we must find a set of operators that commute with one another and with the Hamiltonian. The operators must commute with il so that in stationary states, the observables they represent could be sharp. They must commute with one another so that in these states, they all could simultaneously be sharp . So a facility with commutators and simultaneous eigenfunctions is an essential skill of any physicist. Aside: Constants of the Motion for Three-Dimensional Systems. Finding the constants of the motion is not an urgent matter in the study of one-dimensional microscopic systems, for we can uniquely identify the (non-degenerate) bound-states of such systems by the single quantum number that labels the energies. Additional labels are redundant. But for three-dimensional systems, where most bound-state energies are de- generate, the energy quantum number alone is not sufficient to uniquely specify a quantum state. One or more additional labels are needed. These labels correspond to observables that are sharp in the stationary states so labelled and hence to constants of the motion. For example, one of the simplest realistic three-dimensional systems is the hydrogen atom (one electron and one proton). All bound-state energies except the ground-state energy are degenerate, and the stationary-state wave functions for the bound states are usually (but not necessarily) labelled by quantum numbers corre- sponding to the energy, the square of the orbital angular momentum of the electron with respect to the proton, and the projection of this angular momentum along one space-fixed axis (usually ez ) . The latter two observables correspond to the operators (2 and i.; and using their quantum numbers to label stationary states is legitimate only because these observables commute with ii. (To uniquely specify a state of an electron in a hydrogen atom, one must also specify the orientation of another, purely quantum-mechanical angular momentum called the electron spin. We'll study spin in Volume II.) To close this section, let's summarize the results we expect in a simultaneous measurement of E and a constant of the motion Q. If the system is in a simultaneous eigenstate of these observables, then 6.E(t) = 0 } at any time t (E) (t) = E 6.Q(t) = O} at any time t (Q) (t) = q state is stationary (\\ l.77a) Q is a constant of the motion. (I1.77b) The statement that an observable is constant in time sounds like a classical conservation law. But Eqs. (\\ 1.77) certainly don't look much like such laws, which are usually expressed in terms of time derivatives, as in Eq. (\\ 1.75). In fact, quantum mechanics does yield laws of this form, and they are equivalent to Eqs. (11.77) . To see how to derive them, we must first consider the evolution of an arbitrary observable, which is the Sec. 11.5 Constants of the Motion in Classical and Quantum Physics 513 topic of the next section. So don 't stop reading yet; you've only heard part of the tale of constants of the motion in quantum physics. 11.6 CONSERVATION LAWS IN QUANTUM PHYSICS You have probably noticed that in quantum mechanics we often find ourselves questioning concepts we have lived with for years, re-defining familiar notions so they can be applied to the uncertain microscopic universe. Consider, for example, the statement \"the observable Q is conserved.\" In classical physics, this declaration means simply that the value of Q does not change with time. Conservation of Q is a property of the system; it holds for any state ti.e., any trajectory). For a single macroscopic particle in one dimension, the simplest classical system, the definition of a conserved quantity is d dt Q[x(t),p(t)] = 0 Q is conserved for any state {x(t),p(t)} {::::::} (classical physics) (11.78) This is the form of a conservation law in classical physics . The energy of an isolated macroscopic system, for example, does not change as the system evolves, regardless of the trajectories of the constituent particles. A measurement of the energy-or of any other conserved observable-yields the same value no matter when it is performed. But for a microscopic system we cannot define a conserved observable as one whose value in any state does not change with time, because for any observable Q there exist quantum states in which the observable does not have a value-namely, those in which AQ > O. The difficulty with the classical definition (11.78) is vividly illustrated by the sim- plest microscopic system: a free particle in one dimension (Chap . 4). For any physically admissible wave function, any wave packet, the energy, position, and momentum of the particle are uncertain, so in no state does a free particle have a value of E, of z, or of p. It is clearly nonsense, then, to ask if \"the value of E or x or p\" is independent of time. Yet, we expect the energy of a free particle to be conserved, for no external influences act on the particle to induce a change in this observable. We need, clearly, a new definition of a conserved quantity. Conserved Quantities for Microscopic Systems Our definition should express the time independence of some measurable quantity, so we won 't consider definitions expressed directly in terms of the operator, such as dQ/ dt = O. And our definition must not depend on a particular state of the system . A sensible way to define a conserved quantity is: one whose mean value in any state does not change as the system evolves, i.e., d - (Q) (t) = 0 dt for any state \\II {::::::} Q is conserved (quantum physics) (11.79) 514 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II Note that we must add the qualifier \"for any state W\" to this definition, because the expectation value (Q) is state dependent. For a single particle in one dimension, this definition readsl\" d d ( I A I d 1 00 Adt (Q) (t) = dt W Q w) = dt -Xl w*(x, t)Qw(x, t) dx = O. (11.80) Note carefully that to prove that an observable Q is not conserved, you need find only one state that violates (11.79). Aside: Conservation Laws and the Correspondence Principle. Using (Q) to define a conserved observable is also suggested by the Correspondence Principle. According to Â§ 5.7, the transition between quantum and classical physics is made via expectation values [go look at Eqs. (5.86)]. So by defining a conserved observable for a quantum system by (11.79) we set ourselves up to regain the corresponding classical conservation law (11.78) in the classical Iimit-a satisfying connection we'll explore in Â§ 11.7. Conserved Quantities and Constants of the Motion In practice, the definition (11.79) suffers from its state dependence . Were we to apply it literally to an observable Q, we'd have to evaluate (Q) = (w I Q I w) for all states W, checking each expectation value for time dependence . This definition is not wrong, it's just awkward to apply. But there is a deeper reason than mere inconvenience why it is less than ideal. Whether or not an observable is conserved, in quantum as in classical physics , is a property of the observable and , via the Hamiltonian , of the system dynamics. So we should be able to define this property without reference to states of the system. [Recall that in Chap. 10 we freed the definition of Herrniticity, another property of operators, from its dependence on state functions in Eq. (10.24), by introducing the adjoint (Â§ 10.4) in Eq. (10.57).] In classical physics the conserved observables of a system are its constants of the motion. Similarly, as we'll now prove, a conserved observable in quantum mechanics is a constant of the motion, i.e., is one whose operator commutes with tc. for all 'Ii I (11.81) The commutation relation [il ,Q] = 0 is the state-independent expression of the status of Q as a conserved observable. To prove (11.81) we must back off for a moment from conserved observables and consider the evolution of the mean value of an arbitrary Hermitian operator. lfiyou may be wondering if we could define a conserved observable in terms of some other measurable quantity, such as the probability for obtaining a particular value in a measurement of the observable. The trouble with such a definition is that it would be unwieldy, because to encompass all possible outcomes we would have to require constancy of the probabilit ies for all values that could be obtained in the measurement. But from these probabilities we can always calculate (Q) (see Â§ 3.3 and 3.6), so the more convenient definition (11.79) is preferable. Moreover, as noted, this definition facilitates the transition to classical physics. [In the next chapter, we'll discover that if Q is conserved according to (11.79), then the probabilities for all possible outcomes of measurement of Q are independent of time. So all this hangs together.] Sec. 11.6 Conservation Laws in Quantum Physics 515 The Time Development of an Expectation Value Let Q be an arbitrary Hermitian operator-it may even depend on time [cj., the potential energy in Question 11.18]. The first derivative of the expectation value of any such operator is given by Eq. (11.80). Our first step in deriving a more convenient expression for this quantity is to move the time derivative inside the integral.F When we pull this switch, we must change the total derivative to a partial derivative, because this derivative now acts on functions of time and spatial variables, e.g., d J\"\" a-d(Q(t)) = s: [w*(x,t)Q(t)W(x,t)]dX. t -00 t Expanding this partial derivative, we obtain ~(Q(t)) = i: [a:* QW+ w* (~~w) + w*Q~~]dx. (11.82) (11.83) Note the presence in the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (11.83) of the partial derivative of Q with respect to time. This term allows for the possibility that Q depends explicitly on tirne.l'' I want next to focus on the first and third terms on the right-hand side of (11.83), so I'll separate out the term involving aQ/fJT, writing it as an expectation value, and will temporarily move it to the left-hand side of the equation, viz., !!.-(Q(t)) _ (aQ) = Joo [aw* QW+ w*Qaw] dx. dt at -00 at at (11.84) (11.85a) (l1.85b) Now, to derive a useful expression from (11.84) we must get rid of the partial derivatives in it. We faced a similar labor in Chap. 6 when deriving the rate equation for probability flow, Eq. (6.113) (Â§ 6.8). There we used the Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equation to eliminate the first partial time derivative of w(x, t) by writing aw = -!-ilw at 1i a=* = ~(ilwr Using the same trick on (11.84), we obtain :t(Q(t)) - (~) = !- Joo {[ilw(x, t)rQW(x, t) - w*(x, t)Qilw(x, t)} dx (l1.86a) 1i _\"\" = ~[(ilw IQW) - (w IQilw)] . (l1.86b) 17 1 haven't been picky about mathematical rigor in this book, but I should note here that this step is legitimate because of the continuity of 'It and its first derivative, and because the limits of integration in (11.80) are constant. HI Actually, this possibility is unlikely; such explicit time dependence occurs rarely in quantum- mechanical operators. But it does show up in the response of microscopic systems to applied external fields, a mailer we'll leave for Volume II. 516 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II We can now use the Henniticity of H to prepare the first Dirac braket in (l1.86b) to be combined with the second, viz., :t(Q(t)) - (~)= *[('11 IHQW) - ('11 IQHW)] = *('11 I HQ - QHI '11). (11.87a) (l1.87b) We instantly recognize the right-hand side of Eq. (11.87b) as the commutator [H, QI. SO the rate of change of the expectation value of an arbitrary Hermitian operator is d (8Q) 1 A A dt (Q(t)) = at + 1i(i['7-l, QJ) (11.88) Question 11-19 Use the general result (11.88) to prove that the normalization of an arbitrary state function is independent of time, i.e., This is, of course, not a new result-we proved it in Chap. 6 using a different stratagem. Summary and Return to Classical Conservation Laws If, as is usually the case, the operator Q does not explicitly depend on time, then (~~)= 0, (11.89) in which case the equation that governs the evolution of the expectation value of Q is simply [Q independent of t I (11.90) This equation pertains to all the operators we have studied thus far (to H, X, p, fI) and to most of those whose acquaintance we 'll make in Volume II. 19 19There is a rather advanced formulation of classical mechanics that leads to an equation of motion strikingly analogous to the quantum-mechanical result (11.88). This formulation involves a classical quantity called a Poisson bracket. For a classical observable Q[Xi(t),pi(t) ;i = 1,2, . . . ,N] = Q(t) that pertains to a (one-dimensional) system of N macroscopic panicles whose classical Hamiltonian is H, the Poisson bracket is defined as N {Q ,H} == '\" (8 Q 8H _ 8Q 8H) . ~ 8X i 8Pi 8Pi 8Xi i=] Poisson bracket of Q and H The rate of change of the observable Q(t) can be expressed in terms of the Poisson bracket of Q and H as d 8Q diQ(t) = at + {Q ,H} . This equation looks very like (11.88); but all quantities in it are functions, not operators. Sec. 11.6 Conservation Laws in Quantum Physics 517 Now suppose Q is a constant of the motion of the system with Hamiltonian ii. Then, by the definition (11.74), [ii,Q] = O. Ergo the right-hand side of (11.90) is zero and, according to the definition (11.79), Q is conserved. This little argument proves Eq. (11.81). Its point is that you 'll find it much easier to determine whether or not a given observable is conserved by evaluating the commutator ofits operator and the Hamiltonian rather than by checking all possible expectation values for time dependence. Example n .s. The Parity Operator We have already demonstrated that the parity operator fI commutes with the Hamiltonian of a system whose potential energy is symmetric . Hence parity is a constant of the motion and, according to (11.81), is conserved, i.e., d dt (IT) = 0 for all W [conservation of parity) (11.91) But if V(x) is not symmetric (e.g., for the asymmetric square well of Fig. 9.7), then [il ,fI] # 0, and parity is not conserved. The conservation of parity for submicroscopic physical systems was an issue that, a few years ago, generated a lot of controversy (and a Nobel prize); we'll look briefly at its history in the last section of this chapter. Example n .6. Conservation of Energy One of the most important laws in physics is conservation of energy. According to the definition (11.79), the observable E is conserved if ~(1i) = 0 for any state W conservation of energy (11.92) Evidently, Eq. (11.92)\" holds for a stationary state, since for such a state the expectation value (1i) = (W I illw) = (WI ilw) (11.93) is simply equal to the sharp energy of the state, E. But that's not good enough; to prove that energy is conserved we must verify (11.92) for any state, stationary or non-stationary. But how much easier to use the alternate formulation in (11.81) : any operator com- mutes with itself, so [il ,il] = O. This implies (11.92), i.e., that the energy is conserved. Still, there's a subtle feature to this proof. In it, we assumed that il did not explicitly depend on time. What happens if V = V(x , t)? Using our general result (11.88) we find :t (1i)(t) = (a;;). [for a time-dependent potential] (11.94) As expected, the energy of a non-conservative microscopic system (one whose potential depends on t) is not conserved. In Chap. 12 we'll investigate further the consequences of an observable being conserved; but we've already discovered the essential features . The crucial mathematical and physics statements of Â§11.5-11.6 are summarized in the following handy diagram: 518 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II constant of the motion ~ 1 [il,Q] = 0 ~ conserved observable 1 ~(Q) = 0 for all \\II ( 11.95) Question 11-20 Supose the initial state of a quantum system (III at t = 0) is an eigenstate of a constant of the motion Q. Time passes, and the system evolves (but no measurements are performed on it). Is III(x, t) for t > 0 an eigenfunction of Q? Why or why not? I began this section by discussing conservation laws in classical physics; we write these laws in terms of observables that are represented by functions of time. We've now seen the nature of the corresponding laws of quantum physics: we write these laws in terms of the expectation values of observables that are represented by operators. The transition between a quantum-mechanical conservation law and its classical counterpart is fairly straightforward, since according to Eqs. (5.85) (Q)(t) 6.Q(t) in the classical limit. Q(t) o Correspondence Principle (11.96) But the Correspondence Principle is not limited to conservation laws. Perhaps all laws in quantum mechanics, if expressed in terms of expectation values, can be related through the Correspondence Principle, to their classical counterparts. Indeed they can, as we'll see in the next section. 11.7 PHYSICAL LAWS AND THE CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLE . . . listen. The sound of physics. The soft, breathless whir of Now. Just listen. Close your eyes, pay attention: Murder, wouldn't you say? A purring electron? Photons, protons? Yes, and the steady hum of a balanced equation. - from The Nuclear Age (A Novel) by Tim O'Brian The bedrock of classical mechanics is Newton's Second Law of Motion, popularly known (for a single particle in one dimension) as F=ma. (11.97) You have probably seen an alternate form of this law, in which it is written in terms of the linear momentum, Sec. 11 .7 d p(t) = m dtx(t), Physical Laws and the Correspondence Principle (11.98) 519 and the potential energy V(x , t) , which is related to the force by a F(x , t) = - ax V(x , t) . (11.99) Using these equations and a = dp(t)jdt in (11.97), we can easily derive this alternate form of Newton's Second Law, an expression for the rate of change of the momentum function p(t) : d a dtP(t) = - ax V(x , t) = F(x, t) [classical physics] (Il.lOO) We can also easily derive the corresponding equation for the rate of change of the position function x(t), Eq. (11.98), viz.,2o d 1 -d x(t) = -p(t) t m [classical physicsI (11.101) According to the Correspondence Principle (11.96), we retrieve classical observ- ables, such as x(t) and p(t), in the classical limit from the expectation values of the corresponding operators, such as (x) (t) and (P) (t). The classical laws (11.100) and (11.101) describe the evolution of the observables in this limit, while quantum laws derived from the general evolution equation (11.88) describe changes in the expectation values. What are these quantum laws? And do they indeed translate into the correspond- ing classical laws in the classical limit? Ehrenfest's Theorem These provocative questions were answered in 1927 by the Austrian physicist Paul Ehren- fest (1880-1933). Ehrenfest was a member of the \"second generation\" of founders of quantum mechanics. He was a friend of Albert Einstein (a leader of the first generation) and shared Einstein's interests in the foundations of quantum theory and its relationship to thermodynamics and to statistical physics. In a paper published in a 1927 issue of the distinguished German journal Zeitschrift fUr Physik [45,455 (1927)], Ehrenfest proved \"by a short elementary calculation without approximations\" that for a single particle (in one dimension) d (aV)dt (P) (t) = - ax . Ehrenfest's Theorem (one dimension) (11.102) 200ne reason for rewriting Newton 's law in the form of Eqs. (11.100) and (11.101) is that these equations highlight the functions that make up the trajectory, x(t) and p(t). Equations (11.100) and (11.101) are called Hamilton's equations (yes, the same Hamilton) and are often written in terms of the classical Hamiltonian H(x,p, t) as d {) -x(t) = -H(x ,p,t) dt Bp d {) -p(t) = --H(x,p,t) . dt {)x If you're interested, take a minute to convince yourself that these are identical to (11.100) and (11.101) for a classical Hamiltonian H(x, p, t) = T(p) + V(x, t) . 520 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II This is the quantum-mechanical analog of Newton 's Second Law, Eq. (11.1(0): it relates the rate of change of the momentum to the slope of the potential energy (i.e., to the force) for a state of the system. Ehrenfest went on to show that in the classical limit, this result reduces to its classical counterpart.P! The impact of Ehrenfest's research on the physics community in the early thirties was enormous. Physicists thought, quite reasonably, that if this upstart new quantum theory was correct, then not only its physical quantities but also its physical laws must reduce to those of classical physics in the appropriate limit. Ehrenfest's work therefore contributed greatly to the acceptance of Schrodinger's theory. Newton's Second Law Regained (Almost) We'll prove Ehrenfest's Theorem in two stages. First , we will develop the quantum- mechanical counterpart of the classical equation for the rate of change of position, Eq. (IUOI). Then we'll tackle the rate of change of momentum, which will lead us to Ehrenfest's analog of Newton's Second Law. The rate of change of (x) (t) is given by Eq. (11.88) as d 1 (A )dt(X)=1i i[1i,x] , (11.103) since ax/at = O. Conveniently, the commutator we need appears in Table 11.3: [ -0 A] _ in A IL ,X - --p o m Substituting this commutator into (11.103) we easily obtain d 1 -d (x) (t) = - (p) (t) , t m (11.104) (11.105) whose resemblance to (11.10 I) I need hardly mention. To evaluate the rate of change of (P) we pull the same trick. The evolution equation for this observable is (11.106) In Table 11.3 we find the commutator This result leads us immediately to d (av)- (P) (t) = -- dt ax (11.107) (11.108) 2 1 But Ehrenfest did not formulate his theorem in terms of expectation values. Rather he discussed the evolution of the mean value of the linear momentum in terms of averages over wave packets. Equation (11.101) is a \" translation\" of his finding into the lingo of modem quantum mechanics. The year following publication of Ehrenfest's paper, A. E. Ruark showed how to extend it to N-particle systems [Phys . Rev.â€¢ 31, 533 (1928)1. Sec. 11 .7 Physical Laws and the Correspondence Principle 521 Now, by identifying the first derivative of the potential with the force [Eq. (ll.lOO)] and taking the derivative of (P) via Eq. (ll.105), we can tum (ll.108) into cP m dt2 (x) (t) = (F(x, tÂ» . (11.109) At first glance, this looks very much like Newton's Second Law, Eq. (ll.lOO). But they're not the same. Not yet. Can you see the difference? Ponder carefully the expectation value of the force. For a state \\l1 this quantity is i:\\l1*(x, t)F(x, t)\\l1(x, t) dx = - i:\\l1*(x, t) [~V(x, t)] \\l1(x, t) dx . (I l.l 10) The difference is that (F) (t) on the right-hand side of (ll.lD9) is not necessarily equal to F ( (x) (tÂ»). To appreciate the importance of this difference, consider what would happen to Eq. (ll.lD8) if, as is the case for some systems, these quantities happened to be equal: (F) (t) = F( (x) (tÂ») d dt (P) (t) = F( (x) (tÂ»). (11.111) In this special case, the quantum-mechanical equations that govern the evolution of the expectation values (x) (t) and (p) (t) have precisely the same form as the classical laws for x(t) and p(t) . \"But,\" you ask, \"isn't the relevant question whether (x) (t) and (P) (t) evolve according to the laws of classical physics in the classical limit?\" Right you are. And in this limit, all is well, foc2 2 (11.112) LlIx-+O (x)(t)-+x(t)i:\\l1*(x,t)F(x,t)\\l1(x,t)dx ---t) F( (x) (tÂ»). This is the essence of Ehrenfest's theorem: Rule In the classical limit, the equations that describe the time development of (x) (t) and (P) (t) are identical to the equations of Newtonian mechanics. Notice that the mathematical form of Eq. (ll.105) for d (x) (t)/dt is identical to that of Eq. (ll.lDl) for dx(t)/dt. And, as I remarked above, for certain systems (such as the simple harmonic oscillator), Eq. (ll.108) for d (p) (t)/dt is identical in form to (ll.lOO) for dp(t) / dt. But the peculiar structure of Eq. (ll.l 09) for an arbitrary potential throws a monkey wrench into the works, which we can get rid of only by taking the classical limit. 22Remember that in the classical limit the spatial extent of P(x , t) = '1t.(x, t)'1t(x, t) is negligible (for the duration of any measurement) . Mathematically speaking, this is a statement of spatial localization. For example, if the center of P(x , t) occurs at xo. then in the classical limit this function can be replaced by the Dirac Delta function 6(x - xo) with no loss of accuracy. 522 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II Question 11-21 Demonstrate that the fonn of the classical and quantum equations for evolution of position and its expectation value are identical for a simple harmonic oscillator, i.e., that (F(x,tÂ» = F(x) (tÂ» (11.113) Question 11-22 Demonstrate that (11.112) follows in the classical limit b.x(t) --+ O. Question 11-23 Show why we run into trouble if the potential depends on a power of x higher than the second by demonstrating that (F(x, tÂ» f F (x) (tÂ» (11.114) Just What IS the Relationship of Quantum to Classical Physics? The equations we've derived forthe time development of the mean values of position and momentum add a remarkable new dimension to the Correspondence Principle, revealing that the connection of classical and quantum physics is deeper than we heretofore per- ceived. From Chap. 5 we knew that statistical properties, which must be used to describe an observable in quantum mechanics, go over correctly in the classical limit to functions of time, which describe the observable in classical physics. But now we have discov- ered that the relationships between these statistical properties-in particular between the expectation values of the fundamental observables, position and momentum-also go over into the corresponding relationships of classical physics. So the laws of nature in quantum mechanics are, in this sense, consonant with those of classical physics.P Still, as satisfying as this consonance is, it is not quite as profound as you might think. There is a sense in which we implicitly assumed Ehrenfest 's theorem when we set up our postulates in Part II. The operator postulate (Postulate III, Chap. 5) prescribes that quantum-mechanical operators, such as il, shall be constructed from classical ob- servables, such as T + V(x, t). This assumption leads inexorably (if circuitously) to Ehrenfest's theorem. So the Correspondence Principle leaves certain aspects of the relationship between quantum mechanics and Newtonian mechanics a bit vague. The implications of this 23There is another way to retrieve the laws of classical physics written in a form that looks like the commutator-infested equations of this chapter. In an earlier footnote I introduced the Poisson brackets for two classical observables Q and R . We can recast the laws of classical physics in terms of these brackets. arriv ing at results such as the following expressions for the derivatives of an arbitrary observable Q[x(t) ,p(t)]: oQ- = -{Q,x} op oQ ox = {Q ,p} . Regardless of the particular classical law you are working with , you can obtain from it the corresponding quantum-mechanical equation by merely replacing the Poisson brackets by the commutator of the relevant observables, appropriately scaled : replace {Q,R} by -*[Q,R] For more on Poisson brackets , see Â§ 9.4ff of Classical Mechanics. 2nd ed, by H. Goldstein (Reading. Mass .: Addison-Wesley, 1980). Sec. 11.7 Physical laws and the Correspondence Principle 523 ambiguity have been well expressed by Daniel T. Gillespie in his fine book A Quantum Mechanics Primer (London: International Textbook, 1973) (p.113): . .. it is not altogether clear just what the precise logical relationship is between classical and quantum mechanics. . \" we ourselves as the ultimate observers of any physical system, are essentially classical objects, in that our sense can directly perceive only macroscopic phenomena (e.g., dial readings, instrument settings, etc). This fact probably places severe restrictions not only on what things we can perceive about a microscopic system, but also on how we interpret what we perceive. We shall return to this issue in Chap. 13, where we directly confront the Problem of Measurement. Aside: A Philosophical Note. Before we leave the Correspondence Principle, I want to add a note on \"quantum epistemology.\" Discussions of this principle seduce some readers into the impression that quantum mechanics somehow subsumes classi- cal physics, that it is more fundamental and obviates the need for classical mechanics in physical theory. This is wrong. Although some physicists have tried to conjure up an interpretation of quantum mechanics that does describe everything,24 the prevail- ing view is that a dual description is unavoidable, that neither quantum mechanics nor classical mechanics alone describes the physical universe. The reasons for this necessary dualism require an appreciation of subtle features of the Correspondence Principle that we haven't the space to dlscussr\" suffice it to say here that the many possibilities inherent in the (Copenhagen) description of a microscopic system do not always go over smoothly into a single actuality, a necessary characteristic of a classical description. *11.8 THE STRANGEST \"UNCERTAINTY RELATION\" OF THEM ALL \"The tragedy of science is the heartless murder of beautiful theories by ugly facts.\" -John Bishop in Artifact by Gregory Benford All of the elements of quantum mechanics that we have investigated in this chapter- commutators, simultaneous eigenfunctions, uncertainty relations, conservation laws- interlock via the theorems and equations we have discussed. In the flow chart in Fig. 11.2, I have attempted to summarize and systematize this maze of connections . Many of these elements come together in the definition and derivation of the \"energy-time uncertainty relation,\" which for reasons I'll explain in a minute, I prefer to call the energy-time inequality: (11.115) 24Such as the many-world interpretation of H. Evertt and the hidden variable theories of D. Bohm and others. For a low-key. accessible introduction to these mailers, see Chaps. 9, 12. and 13 of Quantum Reality : Beyond the New Physics by N.

I commented on this relation at various places in Part II , and if you worked Pblm. 4.2 you should have a fairly good intuitive sense of its origin and meaning . This inequality is subtle, even for an uncertainty relation, but we now have the background to define its terms and understand its content. That content is of considerable practical import, for, as you'll see at the end of this section, the energy-time inequality finds application in describing the stationary states of atoms. The first thing to notice about Eq. (11.115) is that it's not an uncertainty relation- at least not in the sense that we have been using the phrase. Think about time. In quantum mechanics. time is not an observable; it is a parameter. We may choose to investigate a quantum state at one or another time, but we cannot measure time as we can energy or position. And there is no operator i in quantum mechanics . So what is meant by \"the uncertainty in time D.t\"? If by D.t we mean to imply use of the usual definition of uncertainty, D.Q = [(Q)2 - (Q2)jl/:.!, then this symbol means nothing. Time for a Change The question of the meaning of D.t in the inequality (11.115) takes us once again to the heart of quantum physics: measurement. This inequality has to do with change in a quantum state. The issue it addresses is: how much time must elapse before we can say that a system has changed? As I have remarked several times, in quantum mechanics we Sec. 11.8 The Strangest \"Uncertainty Relation\" of Them All 525 deal with such matters in a very pragmatic context-restricting ourselves to statements that can be quantified via experiment: Rule To measure a change in a system, we must detect in an experiment a change in an observable of the system . For example, one way to observe that there has been a change in the state of an ensemble that was initially in, say, a stationary state with energy En is to detect the photons emitted when the members undergo transitions to another, lower-lying state. (The transition may occur of its own accord, as in the spontaneous decay of an atom from an excited state, or by absorption of a photon, or in response to a collision with another microscopic particle, such as an electron.) Defining a \"measurable change\" in a property of a microscopic system is a bit tricky, because such a definition must accommodate states in which the property is uncertain. But regardless of the state, the results of measurement of the observable can be described en masse by the expectation value (Q). SO we would be confident that an uncertain observable Q has actually changed were we to observe that its mean value (Q) has changed by (at least) the uncertainty 6,Q. The time required for a change of this magnitude to occur is the quantity we call 6,t. 26 So only after a time interval 6,t could we (in principle) say whether or not a property of the system has changed. (Actual times involved in measuring changes in the laboratory are much larger than the minimum allowed by the energy-time inequality.) Let us now put this definition on a quantitative footing. The rate of change of (Q) is d (Q) jdt . So the time required for (Q) to change from its initial value (at t = 0) by an amount 6,Q(O) (the uncertainty evaluated at t = 0) is 2 7 (l1.116) 1,=0 According to the energy-time inequality, the minimum time required to measure a change in any observable is related to the uncertainty in the energy of the particle by Eq. (ll.115). On the face of it, this claim seems quite remarkable: why should the uncertainty in the energy control how long it takes to measure a change in some other observable? Let's see. Derivation of the Energy-Time Inequality To develop an expression for the product of the energy uncertainty and the \"change time\" (ll.1l6), we start with a more conventional uncertainty relation: the inequality for the 26 As you can probably tell. I consider use of the symbol I:!.t and the name \"energy-time uncertainty relation\" a little misleading. As defined here. I:!.t is in no sense an uncertainty; rather it is a time interval-s-it: more precise quantum-mechanical terms, it is the amount of time that must pass before we can distinguish llJ(x. I:!.t) from its progenitor llJ(x;O). This time interval is sometimes called \"the measurement time\" and is sometimes labelled by the particular observable being measured, as I:!.tQ. :nThe absolute value bars in the denominator of (I 1.116) are there just to ensure that I:!.t ~ O. as it must for this definition to make sense. 526 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II product of the uncertainty in the energy, AE, and the uncertainty in the observable we're measuring, AQ. We'll then introduce into this relation the rate of change of (Q) and thereby transform it into Eq. (I LlI5).28 According to the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (11.55) the uncertainty product AE AQ is bounded from below as follows: (I Ll 17) The commutator [il, Q] is related to the rate of change of (Q) by the general evolution equation (11.90), i.e., If we replace the commutator in (I l.I 17) by (ILlI8), we wind up with AEAQ ~~I:t (Q)IÂ· (ILl 18) (ILl 19) We're almost there. Dividing both sides of (11.119) by the rate of change of (Q) gives AE AQ > ~ 1ft (Q)I - 2' (I Ll20) According to the definition of the change time At, this is just the energy-time inequality, I Mat>~I- 2 energy-time inequality (11.121) An Application: Natural Widths and Lifetimes of Atoms When an atom initially in an excited stationary bound state decays, it emits a photon whose energy, according to conservation of energy, should equal the difference between the energies of the initial and final states of the atom. Spectroscopists, who measure the energy of the emitted photons from decay of an ensemble of atoms, can deduce a great deal about the properties of the atom. But high-precision spectroscopic measurements reveal that not all photons emitted from an ensemble (all members of which are in the same quantum state) have the same energy, even if all correspond to decay to the same final state. (Usually, the final state is the ground state.) Instead, the frequencies of individual emitted photons fluctuate around the expected value, l/n times the difference between the initial- and final-state energies. From this observation, physicists conclude that associated with the energy of an excited stationary state of an atom is a width AE. 2!lThe derivation draws on one in Quantum Mechanics by A. Messiah (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1965), p. 319-320. See also pp. 152ff in Quantum Physics by R. G. Winter (New York: Wadsworth. 1979). Sec. 11.8 The Strangest \"Uncertainty Relation\" of Them All 527 On the face of it, this conclusion seems nonsensical, for haven't we said innumer- able times that the energy of a stationary state is sharp? Yes. we have .29 But we're no longer discussing \"a stationary state \" in the abstract; we're measuring the energy of a stationary state in the laboratory. And the precision of such a measurement is limited by the energy-time inequality. In this case, the observable we're measuring is the energy of the nth excited state , En.30 So!:!:..t is the time interval that must elapse before we can ascertain that a transition from this state to the ground state has occurred. Atomic physicists call this interval the natural lifetime of the state and often denote it by Tn . With this convention, we write the energy-time inequality as (l I.l22) where (!:!:..E)n is the width of the nth stationary state . (An atom in the ground state cannot decay to any other state, so the width of the ground state of an atom is zero .) One can calculate the natural lifetime Tn by measuring the intensity of the beam of emitted photons as a function of distance along this beam .P! Typically, the lifetimes of excited states of atoms range from 10- 7 sec to 10-9 sec-not very long on a macroscopic scale, but not zero either. Consider, for example, the natural lifetimes in Table 11.5 of the first five excited states of the hydrogen atom. Question 11-24 Calculate the natural widths of each of the excited states of the hydrogen atom whose lifetimes are shown in Table 11.5. Compare your answers to the energies of these stationary states, which are given (in eV) by E = -13.6 n 2 , where n = 1 labels the ground state. Not all excited states are so short-lived. Most atoms have a few special stationary states called metastable states whose lifetimes are typically around 10-3 sec. (Metasta- bility of states, where it occurs, arises for reasons other than the energy-time inequality.) In Table 11.6 are shown lifetimes of several excited states of several atoms ; the point of this table is to suggest the range of lifetimes one finds in nature. Question 11-25 Comment on the truth or falsity of this statement: \"Quantum mechanics lets you violate the law of conservation of energy if you do so quickly enough.\" 29 1 did qualify this blanket statement in Â§ 7.7 by alluding to the interaction of systems with the vacuum electromagnetic field. which interactions eventually induce a decay from any excited stationary state to the ground state. This qualification points out why stationary states as rigorously defined in quantum mechanics do not actually exist in nature. But this fact rarely influences experiments. for the time required for the vacuum field to induce decay is long compared to the duration of most measurements. In this section we are concerned with a quite different phenomenon: limitations imposed by nature on the precision of measurement of the energy of a stationary state. :JÂ°Except for the hydrogen atom (in a simple approximation that neglects certain weak interactions). more than one quantum number is required to uniquely label an energy level. So in an actual application to an actual atom. n here must be replaced by several quantum numbers. however many are needed to uniquely identify a level. Such quibbles are irrelevant. however. to our immediate concerns . :llFor details of such an experiment . see Â§ 9.7 of Modem Atomic Physics: Quantum Theory and Its Applications by B. Cagnac and J.

Smimov (New York: Springer-Verlag. 1985).] The implications of the energy-time inequality may be unsettling. Must we abandon stationary states, with their convenient wave functions and sharp energies? Certainly not. We can continue to probe the mysteries of quantum systems using these states as Sec. 11.8 The Strangest \"Uncertainty Relation\" of Them All 529 theoretical constructs, knowing that we are working within the model of the microscopic universe that is defined by quantum mechanics. But this inequality does mean that when we seek to measure a property of such a state in the laboratory, we must accept the limitations imposed by nature, which prohibits us from pinning down the properties of these systems as precisely as we might Iike.32 *11.9 FINAL THOUGHTS: CONSERVATION \"LAWS,\" DOGMA, AND THE FALL OF PARITY Throughout this chapter, we have dignified a number of results by the name \"laws .\" To so describe a mathematical relationship or a physical principle is to make it sound like absolute truth. But, of course, all such \"laws \" are no more than expressions of how natural scientists (at the moment) understand the workings of the part of the physical universe they study. Some laws, such as Einstein 's statement that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer, still hold; others, such as Newton's \"Laws of Motion\" have required considerable rnodification.P Sometimes the elevation of a physical result into a physical law comes about because of non-scientific factors, such as human nature and aesthetics. Which brings us to conservation ofparity. What is important about this physical law is that it is not true. What is interesting about it is how its falsity was discovered . As Emilio Segre remarks in his popularization From X-Rays to Quarks (San Francisco : Freeman, 1980): The violation of parity conservation is perhaps the greatest theoretical discovery of the postwar era. It has extinguished a prejudice that had been transformed into a principle on the basis of insufficient tests. Parity Reviewed In Chap. 9 we proved that the bound-state Hamiltonian eigenfunctions of a single particle in one dimension with a symmetric potential are eigenfunctions of the parity operator fi. This discovery achieved its most elegant statement in this chapter, where we showed that the commutativity of a symmetric Hamiltonian and fi was responsible for the existence of such simultaneous eigenfunctions and for the conservation of parity as expressed by Eq. (11.91), d (II} jdt = O. From this equation it follows that a state that initially has definite parity has the same parity at all subsequent times. Of course, if il is not symmetric, then [il,fi] =j; 0 and Eq. (11.91) does not hold for all states. But if the potential is symmetric , then a bound stationary state wave function \"lltn(x, t} is transformed under inversion (z --t -x) into either itself or minus itself; consequently the probability density l\"lltn(x, t)12 is unchanged by inversion, and we cannot tell by any measurement that inversion has taken place. A colorful, metaphoric way to describe this fact is to say \"the state is (experimentally) indistinguishable from its mirror image.\" This, in a nutshell, is the meaning of parity invariance. 32For more on uncertainty relations in general and on the energy-time inequality in particular, see the articles in The Uncertainty Principle and the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, edited by W. C. Price and S. S. Chissick (New York: Wiley. 1977). I particularly recommend the article by J. Rayski and J. M. Rayski, which begins on p. 13. 33See How the Laws of Physics Lie by N. Cartwright (New York: Oxford University Press. 1983). 530 Chap. 11 Operators in Quantum Mechanics II This description translates with but slight modification to systems with one or more particles in three dimensions-systems such as atoms, molecules , or elementary particles. In three dimensions, the parity operator transforms r into -r, and parity invariance is colloquially referred to as \" reflection symmetry.\" The situation in three dimensions is, in some respects, unlike the one-dimensional case. For example, the bound Hamiltonian eigenfunctions of a three-dimensional system whose Hamiltonian commutes with IT do not necessarily have definite parity. But commutativity of iÂ£ and IT does guarantee the existence of simultaneous eigenstates , i.e., stationary states with definite parity. If the system contains more than one particle, then reactions among the particles are possible; the particles can, for example, collide or break apart, forming new particles. According to the \"law\" of conservation of parity, the parity of a state of the system is unchanged by such a physical process.\" One can measure the intrinsic parity of various subatomic particles by studying reactions among them, but the deduction of the parities of such a particle hinges on the equality of the parities of the state before and after the reaction. That is, parity must be conserved . But is it? Sometimes a Great Notion From the 1930's until 1956, physicists assumed that the answer was yes. In 1924 Laporte discovered evidence of the parity of states of atoms in his studies of atomic transitions, and soon thereafter the theoretician Eugene Wigner showed parity conservation in such transitions to follow via quite beautiful symmetry arguments (rather like those of Â§ 9.4). What then happened is revealing that physicists are, after all, only human. As Segre puts it: Whenever a regularity is valid in many cases, there is a tendency to generalize it to other untested circumstances and perhaps even to make it into a \"principle.\" . . . Such occurred with the principle of conservation of parity. Then, in 1956, while trying to explain the decay of a particular subatomic particle, the Chinese physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang reviewed the hard evidence for conservation of parity and pointed out that no such evidence existed to substantiate the belief that parity is conserved in all interactions. Lee and Yang discovered that only for the hadronic and electromagnetic interactions had parity conservation been demonstrated in the laboratoryr'' Subsequent experiments by Chien Shiung Wu and others showed that, sure enough, parity conservation had somehow left the rarefied realm of scientific 34 Discussing parity conservation in reactions is complicated by the multi-particle nature of the system; at least two particles must, obviously, be present. The state of such a system must be described by a multi- particle state function, a beast we won't meet until Volume II. Suffice it to say that parity is a multiplicative property, e.g., that the parity of a state of two particles is equal to the product of the intrinsic parity of the first particle, the parity of the second particle, and the parity of their relative motion. For an accessible introduction to these mailers, see Chap. 9 of Subatomic Physics by H. Frauenfelder and E. M. Henley (Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice Hall, 1974), which also includes detailed discussions of the experimental determination of the intrinsic parities of particles. 35 All interactions in nature fall into four categories: the nuclear (also called \"strong\" or \"hadronic\") interaction, which holds the nucleus together; the electromagnetic interaction, which dominates in atoms, molecules, and solids; the weak interaction, which controls some non-electromagnetic decay reactions; and our friend, gravity. For a fine introduction to such mailers, see The Forces of Nature, 2nd ed, by Paul Davies (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1986.) Sec. 11.9 Final Thoughts: Conservation \"Laws,\" Dogma, and the Fall of Parity 531 fact and entered the dubious domain of dogma: systems in which the weak interaction plays a role are not invariant under inversion. The parity of states of such a system is not conserved. Aside: The Puzzle At Hand. Lee and Yang were trying to explain a mystery known as \"the 0-7 puzzle.\" (Only physicists would come up with such a name for a mystery.) Briefly, the problem was this: A particular subatomic particle (called a K-meson, or kaon) was observed to decay into two different states, one a state of even parity, the other of odd parity. (These were called the \"0 decay mode\" and the \"r decay mode,\" respectively. Hence the narne.) The state of the kaon before decay had definite parity, so it appeared that unless two different particles were involved (a hypothesis refuted by other experiments), a parity-changing reaction could occur. The existance of such a reaction violated the tenet of conservation of parity.36 I bring up this historical sidelight hoping it will help you keep the \"laws\" of quantum physics in perspective. There are no true laws in physical theory; there are only the fruits of man's efforts to understand the workings of nature. The results of those efforts are accomplishment enough.

We need only tie up a few loose ends to complete the first leg of our journey through quantum physics. In particular, we must remove two apparent limitations to quantum mechanics, limitations on our ability to access knowledge about observables and to solve the TDSE. In the process, we'll gain further physical insight into the advanced mathematical tools of Chaps. 10 and II. Then, in Chap. 13, we'll confront a major mystery. The first limitation is that we don't know how to extract from a state function the full measure of allowed information about any observable except position. Second, we don't know a practical way to calculate the wave function at t > 0 from its initial form, unless the state is stationary. The apparent exalted status of position is illusory, a side-effect of our decision to represent quantum states by functions of position variables (and time). According to Postulate II, these functions are to be understood as position probability amplitudes; this is the Born interpretation (Chap. 3). If we know only about such functions, we're in good shape if asked to predict the results of a position measurement, but not if faced with a measurement of any other observable. Knowing the wave function at t, we can calculate the position probability density-from which we can, in tum, calculate the probability of detecting the particle in an infinitesimal volume element about a point in space. From this density we can also calculate statistical quantities relating to position: its mean value and uncertainty. But if we want to predict the results of a measurement at t of, say, the energy, we are in trouble. To be sure, we can evaluate from the wave function at t the statistical quantities (E) (t) and L\\E(t)-with no small amount of work-but we don't know how to predict the probabilities of obtaining various values of energy in the measurement. Not yet, anyway. In this sense, quantum theory seems incomplete. Happily, we can easily remedy this defect. In Â§ 12.2 we'll learn how to calculate probabilities for an arbitrary observable, reasoning from the expansion of the wave func- tion in a complete set of eigenfunctions of the operator that represents the observable. Viewed in this light, the eigenfunction expansions of Chaps. 10 and II stand revealed as tools for \"translating\" the information buried in the wave function into the \"languages\" of observables other than position. The second deficiency in our quantum theory derives from our emphasis on sta- tionary states. In Part III, for example, we learned several deft mathematical gambits for solving the time-independent Schriidinger equation for the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions of various (conservative) systems. These functions appear as the space-dependent factors in the wave function of any state that is stationary. But, as I have noted repeatedly, sta- tionary states are special, uncommon in nature. Most quantum states are non-stationary. To solve for the wave function of such a state at t > 0, we must solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, no easy task. 537 Happily, the machinery of Chaps. 10 and 11 has, almost as a by-product, afforded us a crafty way to bypass this sinister partial differential equation: a surprisingly simple way to solve the TDSE without actually solving the TDSE. We'll discuss and illustrate this method in Â§ 12.6 and will explore some of its consequences in Â§I2 .7-I2.9. You may be relieved to learn that we won't need to introduce any new theoretical constructs in this chapter. We can remedy both deficiencies mentioned above by com- bining the mathematical devices of Chaps. 10 and 11 with concepts and methods from previous chapters. A final note. Because this is (almost) the last chapter, I have (none too surrepti- tiously) folded into it a review of most of the high points of this volume. So among the discussions and examples of this chapter,' you'll renew the acquaintance of many old friends. I hope the review aspect of this chapter will help prepare you to start Volume II, where we'll plunge vertiginously into new and strange territory. 12.1 THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF QUANTUM PHYSICS To elaborate a bit on the problems we'll tackle in this chapter, I want to consider briefly a question of knowledge. Every field of physics has an archetypal problem . In classical mechanics, for example, it is to calculate the trajectories of the particles comprising a system, knowing their initial positions and momenta and the forces acting on them. From these trajectories we can calculate any desired property of the system to any desired precision. In quantum mechanics, the nature of the archetypal problem is influenced by the limitations nature imposes on the questions we can ask and by the peculiar language in which we answer. Our ultimate objective is qualitative and quantitative understanding of observed microscopic phenomena and their time development. But in pursuit of this grail we are allowed only a special kind of description of these phenomena, for we can access only probabilistic information about a quantum system. Time Figure 12.1 A schematic representation of the quintessential conundrum of quantum physics: to predict the results of an ensemble measurement of an observable at measurement time t knowing the Hamiltonian of the system and the wave function that represents the initial state. The fundamental problem of quantum mechanics is illustrated schematically in Fig. 12.1. We are given the Hamiltonian it of a system, which operator includes a potential energy derived from the forces acting on and within the system, and the wave function that represents the initial state of the system, \\l1 at t = O. At some time t > 0, a measurement of an observable Q is performed on an ensemble of systems in the state that evolved from the initial condition. The problem is: What happens? That is, what are the possible outcomes of this measurement? 1Students often complain , with some justification. that textbook authors work only easy examples. leaving all the hard stuff for the homework problems. This chapter is, in part. a review. and we have sufficient machinery and sophistication to deal with examples that are more complicated than we have hitherto faced. You'll find a few here. beginning in Â§ 12.4. 538 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions This question is, of course, loaded. Unless the state happens to be an eigenstate of Q, nature forbids a precise answer. But an imprecise answer is allowed, and quantum mechanics should enable us to determine the values that could be obtained in the mea- surement and the probabilities that a member of the ensemble will exhibit each of these values. Yet, quantum mechanics, as we have developed it thus far, does not do this. Let's review just what we do know how to do. Suppose that by hook or crook we have solved the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation , A 8 1-liJ! = in8 t iJ!, (12.1) for the wave function at t; i.e., we have \"propagated\" this function from t = 0 to the measurement time (see Fig. 12.1). We then can calculate the aforementioned statistical quantities from (Q) (t) = (iJ!(t) IQI iJ!(t)) (12.2) and AQ(t) = J(Q2) (t) - [(Q) (t)j2. (12.3) But how do we determine the probabilities P(q, t)? Unless Q = z, or Q = E (and the system is in an energy eigenstate), we're up the proverbial estuary without the proper form of locomotion.? Only for the special case of an energy eigenstate are solving the roSE and deter- mining probabilistic information about energy trivial tasks. If iJ!(x, 0) is an eigenfunction of ii, then at the measurement time the wave function is (12.4) The probabilities of obtaining various values of the energy are equal to 1 if the energy in question is E in (12.4), and equal to 0 otherwise. The mean energy is E, the energy uncertainty is zero. Moreover, for any observable Q, we can calculate the mean value and uncertainty from the eigenfunction 'l/JE(X). As we know from Chap. 7, these quantities are independent of time. But even in the special case of a stationary state, we don't know how to calculate the probabilities for an observable other than E. Here's a hint: consider, for example, a simple harmonic oscillator in its ground state. The probabilities of obtaining various values of position and energy for such a state are (12.6) (12.5) [energy]. P(x) = !'l/Jo(X) 1 2 , [position]. { 1 E = Eo = ~1iwo P(E) = 0 otherwise But how would we calculate , say, the probability of getting +1 in a measurement of parity? You already have, somewhere in memory, a clue to the answer to such questions. Consider linear momentum. What values could be obtained in a measurement of this observable , and what are the probabilities of obtaining each? If you remember how to 2 Up a creek without a paddle. Sec. 12.1 The Fundamental Problem of Quantum Physics 539 (12.7) answer this question, then you know where we must go next: back to one of the bulwarks of quantum theory, the Born Interpretation. 12.2 THE GENERALIZED BORN INTERPRETATION On fire that glows with heat intense We tum the host of common sense And out it goes at a small expense! -Iolanthe by Gilbert & Sullivan Let's defer for the moment the problem of solving the TDSE and suppose that we know the wave function for a state at time t > 0 of a single particle in one dimension. In this section, we'll find out how to extract from this function the full panoply of accessible information about a measurement at t of an arbitrary observable Q. For simplicity, suppose that the spectrum of Q (the eigenvalues of its operator Q) is discrete and non-degenerate. We'll label the eigenvalues with an index n in ascending order, as qI < q2 < q3 < . \" . (We'll consider continuous and mixed spectra in Â§ 12.5.) Finally, suppose the state at this time is not an eigenstate of Q. Easy Calculation of the Mean To begin our generalization of quantum theory, let's consider the average of the results of this measurement, (Q) (t). Calculating this quantity directly from \\II(x,t) a la (Q) (t) = i:\\11*(x, t) Q\\II(x,t) dx might involve considerable complicated algebra-as we've seen in earlier examples, exercises, and problems. Indeed, just working out the effect of Qon \\II(x, t) could be a mess, for, by hypothesis, the wave function is not an eigenfunction of that operator. There is, I am happy to report, an easier way. The considerations of Chaps. 10 and 11 suggest the following alternative: expand \\II(x, t) in eigenfunctions of Q and develop an expression for (Q) in terms of \"the coeffi- cients in this expansion, the projections of \\II on the eigenfunctions of Q. Denoting the eigenfunction for eigenvalue qn by Xn and the corresponding coefficient by cn(t), we can write \\II(x,t) = L cn(t)xn(x). n [expansion observable: Ql. (12 .8) The projection of \\II on Xn, which carries the time dependence, is 3 Cn(t) = (Xn I\\II(t)) = i:X:, (x)\\II(x, t) dx. (12.9) 3 In this chapter and the next, the time at which these coefficients are evaluated is critical. So I am introducing a slight modification to the familiar bracket notation: labelling the state function 'It within a bracket by t. Of course, this function also depends on spatial variables, but these variables are suppressed in the conventions of Dirac braket notation. It is our job to remember that they're there. 540 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions In general, there is one such projection for each eigenvalue, although in particular cases one or more projections may be zero. Such an expansion is possible for any \\I1(X, t), because 0 is Hermitian, so the set of its eigenfunctions is complete. Let's see how this strategem simplifies the evaluation of (Q) (t). To evaluate the expectation value we require the expansion (12.8) of \\11(x, t) and that of its complex conjugate,\" (12.10) n' Substituting these expansions into Eq. (12.7) (and grouping terms suggestively), we obtain (Q) (t) = i: [~c~,(th~,(x)] [0L Cn(thn (x)] dx. n n (12.11) The operator 0 in the second set of square brackets slides through the coefficient in each term in the sum over n and acts on its eigenfunctions Xn to give qnXn' So (12.11) becomes (Q) (t) = 1 00 [Lc~,(t)X~,(x)][LCn(t)qnXn(X)] dx -00 n' n = LLc~,(t)Cn(t)qn<Xn' IXn). n' n (12.120) (12.12b) In writing Eq. (l2.12b) I lapsed back into Dirac notation in the hopes that doing so would clue you in to our next maneuver. Since 0 is Hermitian, its eigenfunctions are orthonormal, i.e., { O n' f. n <Xn' I Xn) = On' ,n = , . 1 n = n (12.13) We can use this Kroneker delta to eliminate one of the sums in Eq. (l2.12b), e.g., by reducing the sum over n',to only one term, n' = n. The expectation value then assumes the simple form (12.14) n n Notice that the remaining summation in this expression must include all eigenvalues of O. Of course, terms for which the projections cn(t) = 0 need not explicitly be included, but whether or not any of these projections are zero depends on the state in question [see Eq. (12.9)]. In general, you must not leave any eigenvalues out of this sum. Equation (12.14) is our alternate method for computing the expectation value. Rather than insert the wave function into the definition (12.7), then act on it with 0 and integrate over x, we first determine the projections on the eigenfunctions of the observable, then simply evaluate the sum in (12.14). Although this method may require 4Can you figure out why in this equation I used n' as the summation index? There is method in my madness: Soon we're going to substitute this expansion and Eq. (12.8) into (12.7). Were we to sum over n in both summations, we would have the devil of a time keeping the two summations distinct. Moral: Alwaysuse different dummy summation indices whencombining severalsums in a singleexpression. Sec. 12.2 The Generalized Born Interpretation 541 evaluating several integrals [the expansion coefficients (12.9)], it is in many cases still easier to implement than the definition (12.7). Question 12-1 Suppose w(x, t) is an eigenfunction of Q. Use Eqs. (12.9) and (12.14) to evaluate (Q) in this case. Example 12.1. The Average Energy of a Non-Stationary State In Example 11.4 we investigated a non-stationary state of the simple harmonic oscillator represented by the wave function [cf, Eq. (11.64)] w(x,t) = ~ ['l/Idx)e-iElt/Ti+ 7'l/12(x)e- iE2t/Ti] . (12.15) At one point in this example, we needed the expectat ion value of the energy, and I claimed that this quantity is 62 (E) = 25 liwo = 2.48liwo. (12.16) Let's see if I was right. Conveniently, the wave function (12.15) is already written as an expansion in eigen- functions {'l/In(x) , n = O,l,2, .. . } of it. So we need not compute the projections cn(t) as such.5 Comparing (12.15) with the general form (12.8), we find Cl(t) = _1_ e- iE1 t/ Ti J5ij (t) 7 - iE2 t / 1i (12 .17) C2 = J5ije Cn(t) = 0 n=Oandn>2 To calculate the mean value of E , we need only insert these projections in the general result Eq. (12.14), which for Q = E takes on the following form:\" oc oc (12.18) n=O n=O Squaring the moduli of the non-zero coefficients in (12.17) and inserting the result into this equation, we obtain 1 3 495 62 (E) = 50 2liwo + 502liwo = 25 liwo, (12.19) in agreement with (12.16). Notice that the mean value does not depend on time . Although the projections in (12 .17) do depend on time, this dependence vanishes because it is restricted to complex exponential factors e- iEnt/Ti, which disappear when multiplied by their complex conjugates as prescribed by Eq. (12.18). Notice also how easy this calculation was compared to direct substitution of w(x, t) into the integral form of (E) . 511lroughout this chapter, you need to keep careful track of the \"expansion observable.\" In this example we chose Q = ii, for the observable we're interested in is the energy. I'll rely on you to remember that cn(t) here is a coefficient in an expansion in energy eigenfunctions, not, as earlier in this section, in eigenfunctions of an arbitrary observable. 6Do not use this expression unlessthe spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the system is solely discrete. It does not apply, for example, to a finite potential, such as the Morse potential (Chap. 9) or the finite square well (Chap. 8). The energy spectra of these systems are a mixture of discrete and continuous portions, and methods to be introduced in Â§ 12.4 are required. 542 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions We could also use the expansion of '1' in eigenfunctions of Q to evaluate the expectation value of an operator function j(Q). But first let's explore further the ex- pression (12.14) for (Q), which is a mathematical clue to the physical significance of the projections cn(t). The Born Interpretation of the State Projections I want to recall an argument we made in Chap. 3 concerning the expectation value of position.' (x) (t) = i:1'1'(x, t)1 2 x d~. (12.20) (12.21) Our understanding of (x) as the average of results obtained in a positron measure- ment follows from the Born interpretation of '1'(x, t) as a position probability amplitude. According to Postulate II, P(x, t) = 1'1'(x, t)12 is the probability that in an ensemble measurement at time t the particle will be detected in the infinitesimal volume element dx at x , Thus 1'1'(x, t)12 serves as the \"weighting factor\" for the value x in Eq. (12.20) for the mean value. This quantity is calculated as an integral rather than a discrete sum because the allowed values of this particular observable encompass the cont inuum from -00 to +00 . Now compare Eq. (12.20) for (x) to Eq. (12.14) for (Q). In the latter, the squared modulus Icnl 2 of each projection Cn serves as a weighting factor for the value qn of the observable Q. That is, the structure of Eq. (12.14) is average _ \"\" [( value of ) ( probability of )] value - ~ observable getting that value . possible results This form suggests that we interpret len(tW as a probability for obtaining the value qn in a measurement of Q at time t , In terms of the ensemble on which the measurement is performed, !cn(tW is the fraction of members that exhibit the value qn [provided the wave function is normalized such that Ln Icn(tW = 1, as in Eq. (12.33) below]. This is the Generalized Born Interpretation,\" To summarize this interpretation, we write Eq. (12.14) as (Q) (t) = L P(qn, t)qn, \" (12.22) 7 A word of advice: Before proceeding further. go back and re-read Â§ 3.4 and 3.6. Doing so will make the analogy I am about to wheel in more striking. 8Bom introduced this interpretation in the second of two papers he published in 1926 [2. fur Phys., 38.803) . In the first of these papers [Goett. Nachr.â€¢ p. 14), Born introduced the idea of interpreting quantum- mechanical quantities as probabilities. (Interestingly. this suggestion-the key to the entire interpretative structure of quantum physics-appeared only in a footnote Born added to the paper after it had been set in type, a \"note added in proof.\") Both papers dealt with electron scattering. but Born's innovation was in no way limited to such processes. Deftly summarizing the structure of the new theory. Born writes: \"The motion of particles follows probability laws but the probability itself propagates according to the law of causality.\" If you are curious about how Born came up with his idea. have a look at Chap. 12 of A. Pais' remarkable book on \"matter and forces in the physical world,\" InwardBound (New York: Oxford University Press. 1986). Sec. 12.2 The Generalized Born Interpretation 543 where probability that in a measurement of Q at time t a member of the ensem- ble will exhibit the value qn (12.23) Example 12.2. Probabilities for Energy Measurement on a Non-Stationary State Let's return briefly to the non-stationary state (12.15) of the simple harmonic oscillator and use the Generalized Born Interpretation to predict the outcome of a measurement of energy. According to Eq. (12.17), only two values will be obtained: E 1 = 3Tiwo/2 and E2 = 5Tiwo/ 2. So no members will exhibit, say, the ground-state energy E = Tiwo/2; nor will any exhibit an energy intermediate between the two observed values, such as 2Tiwo. (There is a more profound reason why such an energy isn't seen, as we'lI discover in the next section.) The probabilities that a member of the ensemble will actualIy exhibit one of these two energies are (12.24) (12.25) (12.26) So we predict that 2% of the member systems will exhibit the lower of the two energies, 3Tiwo/2, and that the other 98% will exhibit the higher, 5Tiwo/2. As expected, these results don't depend on when we perform the measurement, and the sum of the probabilities (12.24) and (12.25) is I. Simple Calculation of Complicated Expectation Values Let's now generalize to/unctions of Q our new method for calculating expectation values from the projections of the state function . Consider, for example, (Q2), which we need to calculate the uncertainty !:1Q [see Eq. (12.3)], (Q2) (t) = 1:w*(x, t) Q2W(X,t) dx. Now watch carefully . Insertion of the expansions (12.8) and (12.10) into (12.26) leads to an equation just like (12.11}-except, of course, that in place of Q in (12.11) we have Q2. The operator Q acting twice on Xn yields q~, instead of qn as in Eq. (12.120). In short order, we obtain the following result : (12.27) n Question 12-2 Fill in the missing steps in the derivation of (12.27). n Example 12.3. The Energy Uncertainty of a Non-Stationary State To realIy appreciate how useful (12.27) is you should reflect on the awkward algebraic difficulties that would arise were we to calculate the uncertainty of a non-stationary state using the integral form for (Q2). In contrast, watch how easy Eq. (12.27) makes this chore. 544 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions In Example 12.2 we calculated (E) for the non-stationary state (12.15) from the projections of this wave function on the eigenfunctions of if.. These projections also appear in the expression for (E 2 ) , 00 (E 2 ) (t) =L Icn(t)1 2 E~. n=O (12.28) Using Eqs. (12.17), we can calculate this expectation value by trivial arithmetic, obtaining (E2) = 1.. (~/iw)2 49 (~1iw )2 = 1234\",2 2 = 617\",2 2 50 2 0 + 50 2 0 200 Wo . wo, (12.29) which agrees with Eq. (l1.69b). This result, together with (12.19), leads us immediately to the uncertainty t:::..E = 0.14/iwo, in accord with Eq. (11.70). Question 12-3 Further generalize the derivations of this section to show that (12.30) n Discuss how you would evaluate this mean value from the coefficients of the power series expansion of the function f(q) [see Eq. (10.12) and surrounding discussion]. Evidently, the mathematical technique of eigenfunction expansion can render cal- culations such as evaluating uncertainties comparatively easy . One wonders what other problems this technique might help us subdue. For example, might it assist in solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation? No textbook author would ask such a question unless the answer is yes, as you'll see in Â§ 12.5. The Languages of Quantum Mechan/cs The central result of this section is the Generalized Born Interpretation (12.23). Although we have thus far applied this interpretation only to the energy, it can be used to extract from a state function probabilistic information about any observable. In Chap. 4, for example, we used a similar technique to extract momentum information via the Fourier Transform of a wave function (Â§ 4.7; see especially Table 4.2); we'll take another look at momentum in Â§ 12.4. Underlying the Generalized Born Interpretation is the mathematical technique of eigenfunction expansion . This technique provides a variety of ways to look at a state. When we consider the particular representation of a state afforded by the wave function 1IJ(x, t), we are \"viewing the state through position glasses .\" That is, this function is the most convenient representation of the state for study of position. But the wave function is not particularly convenient if we are interested in another observable-say, energy. By expanding the wave function in the complete set of eigen- functions of the operator that represents that observable-the eigenfunctions of it-we develop a representation of the state that lets us view it \"through energy glasses.\" The col- lection of all projections of 1IJ on the energy eigenfunctions is an alternate representation of this state. This representation consists of the numbers energy representation (12.31) Sec. 12.2 The Generalized Born Interpretation 545 This set may be infinite in number and may be complex. The energy representation contains no more or less information than does the position representation, the wave function 1If(x, t). But, as the examples of this section attest, the energy representation is as convenient for the study of energy as 1If(x, t) is for the study of position. I have spoken of \"viewing a state through various glasses.\" If you don't like this optical metaphor, you might prefer to think of an eigenfunction expansion as a device for translating physical information concerning the state from its expression in 1If(x, t), in the \"language of position,\" to its expression in (12.31), in the language of energy. Thus, the expression for (E) we used in the examples of this section is the translation (E) (t) = i:1If*(x, t)1t1If(x, t) dx +-----+ n (12.32) Using the power and flexibility of eigenfunction expansion, we can translate all of the fundamental equations of quantum physics into the language of any observable (see Fig. 12.2). Here, for example, is the translation of the normalization requirement (1If 11If) = 1 from the language of position into that of energy: i:1If*(x, t)1If(x, t) dx = 1 (12.33) n Figure 12.2 Several representations of a quantum state lit. To translate the wave function into the des ired representation. we merely expand it in the complete set of eigenfunctions of the operator that represents the observable of interest ; the resulting projections are an alternate . often more convenient. representation of the state. Question 12-4 Write down the translation of the normalization requirement into the language of an arbitrary observable Q with a discrete spectrum. How could you use this form to normalize an initial wave function that was written as a linear combination of eigenfunctions of Q? 12.3 ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS: POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF MEASUREMENT Surely our profession, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our result. . .. the quick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the triumphant vindication of bold theories -are these not the pride and the justification of our life's work? -Sherlock Holmes, in The Valley of Fear by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 546 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions In the previous section we considered an energy measurement on a simple harmonic oscillator in the non-stationary state (12.15). In discussing the possible outcomes of this measurement (Example 12.2). I remarked in passing that no values other than E 1 = 3nwo/2 and E z = 5nwo/2 would be seen; no other eigenvalues (En for nfl, 2). nor any energies not equal to an eigenvalue. The probabilities (12.24) and (12.25) support this remark: the sum of P(E1 ) = 0.02 and P(Ez) = 0.98 is 1.0. so E 1 and Ez exhaust the possibilities inherent in this state function. This crucial feature of this state is mirrored in its wave function. which is revealed in (12.15) as a superposition of the first and second excited states only . We can generalize these findings about the poss ible outcomes of measurement to an energy measurement on an arbitrary state of an arbitrary quantum system. Assuming, for simplicity. that the (energy) spectrum of the system is discrete. the expansion of the wave function of the state in eigenfunctions {'l!'n (x)} looks like 00 III(x, t) = L c\" (t)'l!'\"(x). n=1 (12.34) The interpretation of the projections cn(t) as energy probability amplitudes admits the possibility that a system could exhibit any of the eigenvalues En. The probability for obtaining the n th eigenvalue. P(En) = Icn(tW. is non-zero only if the projection Cn(t) = ('l!'n I Ill) happens to be non-zero for the state Ill. But no other energies are possible ..the list of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, {En' all n} exhausts the poss ibilities in any state function Ill. . This seems a radical conclusion. and you may be wondering. nervously, \"How can I be sure all possibilities are included in (12.34)?\" Let's add the probabilities for each of the eigenvalues and see if the result is equal to 1. If this sum is less than 1. then a member might exhibit an energy other than one of the eigenvalues of if. But if the sum is equal to one. then each member will exhibit one of the eigenvalues. (If it is greater than one. we've made a mistake.) The sum of the probabilities of obtaining one of the eigenvalues of it is co oc L P(En ) = L Icn(t)l z . n=l n=1 Do you recognize this sum? * * * Pause while reader ponders * * * (12.35a) Sure; it is the normalization integral (Ill I Ill) expressed in the language of energy [cf. (12.33)]. And for any state Ill. the normalization integral is unity. so oo LP(E n) = 1. ,,=1 (12.35b) Consequently. in an energy measurement of a microscopic system (whose Hamiltonian has a discrete spectrum). each member exhibits either E 1 or E z or E3 or any other eigenvalue E\" . But no other value. This phenomenon is. of course. energy quantization. Sec. 12.3 All That Heaven Allows: Possible Outcomes of Measurement 547 Example 12.4. Energy Quantization in the Laboratory Quantization of energy was stunningly demonstrated in famous energy-loss experiments conducted by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914. Today, energy-loss experiments play an important role in the study of electron scattering from atoms and molecules. The goal of a modem energy-loss experiment is usually to determine accurate cross sections-the probabilities that an incident electron will scatter in various directions, with (or without) an attendant loss of energy. (Recall Â§ 8.3.) Were the (bound-state) energies of the target not quantized, a projectile with incident kinetic energy T could lose any amount of energy from 0 to T, and the observed energy-loss spectrum-the energies of the scattered electrons, as measured by the detector-would be smooth, revealing this continuum. Instead, it shows spikes (see Fig. 12.3a). We now know the reason. No matter what the state of a target particle is prior to the collision, an incident electron can induce transitions only between the stationary states of the target, for the only energies available to the target are the eigenvalues of its Hamiltonian . That is, the state of the target before and after the collision must either be a stationary state or a superposition of stationary states; neither possibility admits energies other than the Hamiltonian eigenvalues. Consider, for example, a gas of molecules that are initially in their ground vibrational state (n = 0 in the simple harmonic oscillator model). An electron incident on such a gas can lose energy only in discrete multiples of Ii times the fundamental vibrational frequency of the molecule. (Of course, the simple harmonic oscillator model is only an approximation, and observed energy-loss spectra reveal deviations from the equal spacing predicted by' this model. The point, however, is not the size of the spacings but the fact that they are invariably seen.) This behavior is illustrated by the energy-loss spectrum for e-F2 scattering in Fig. 12.3.!l In this experiment, a beam of nearly mono-energetic electrons is fired out of an electron gun at an incident kinetic energy of 1.6 eV. This electron beam crosses a beam of F2 molecules, and the resulting scattered electrons are picked up by a detector that is capable of measuring energy within an experimental uncertainty of about 0.03 eV. The energy-loss spectrum in Fig. 12.3a shows the intensity of detected electrons that have lost less than 0.8 eV. At each energy loss, the intensity is proportional to the fraction of electrons in the incident beam that lost that amount of energy, i.e., to the quantum- mechanical probability of an incident electron losing that amount. This spectrum consists of regularly-spaced peaks separated by about 0.11 eV. (We note from Table 9.1 that for this molecule, liwo = 0.1l36eV.) The large peak at zero energy loss corresponds to elastic scattering, but each of the other peaks corresponds to excitation of F2 molecules from the ground vibrational state (n = 0) to excited vibrational levels with n = 1,2, . . . ,7. (Excitations to states with n > 7 are so unlikely that they aren't seen in this experiment.) The levels involved in these excitations are superimposed on the potential energy curve for F2 in Fig. 12.3b [compare to Fig. 9.13, the potential energy curve for H21. You can see that the potential well of the ground electronic state deviates somewhat from the purely parabolic shape of a true SHO potential. These deviations are responsible for the barely perceptible differences in the spacings between adjacent peaks in the spectrum.'? This argument, that the normalization requirement proves that only eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be obtained in a measurement of energy, generalizes easily to an 9y. Fujita. S. Vagi, S. S. Kano, H. Takuma, T. Ajiro, T. Takayanagi, K. Wakiya, and H. Suzuki, Phys. Rev. A., 34, 1568 (1986) . IOThe width of each spike in the spectrum is due primarily to the finite \"energy resolutions\" of the detector and of the source . That is, an experimentalist can determine the energy only to within the experi- mental uncertainty of these devices. (This uncertainty is much larger than the natural Iinewidth, the quantum- mechanical uncertainty imposed by nature.) This imprecision manifests itself as a width in the measured spectrum . 548 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions X 32 o 0.2 0.4 Energy loss (eV) (a) 0.6 0.8 4.0 3.0 3n u 2.0 S' ~ >- Figure 12.3 (a) An energy-loss spectrum ~ Ol for e-F2 collisions showing excitation of<: w 1.0 bound vibrational states from the ground state, n = O.

No matter what the observable, the normalization condition translates into a mathematical statement that the sum of the probabilities for all the eigenvalues is unity. Hence no other possibilities are allowed: Sec. 12.3 All That Heaven Allows: Possible Outcomes of Measurement 549 Rule The only possible outcomes of measurement of an observable on any quantum state are the eigenvalues of the operator that represents the observable. Aside: Thinking about the Continuum. In thinking about this rule, it is very important to remind yourself that these eigenvalues need not be discrete. I picked energy quantization of the SHO to illustrate this rule in a dramatic context that would lead us back to ideas we encountered early in this book. But the spectra of eigenvalues of most operators consists of discrete and continuous parts; any value in thecontinuum of suchan operator is allowed. But no value is allowed from the range encompassing the discrete part except one of the eigenvalues. We'll discuss continuous and mixed spectra further in the next section. The Pause That Refreshes Stop and think for a moment about how utterly remarkable this rule is. It is a pinnacle of our exploration of the microworld, the point at which all the basic ideas we discussed in Chap. 2-uncertainty, duality and quantization-have emerged naturally and without additional hocus pocus from the postulates of quantum mechanics . Our study of the (admittedly abstract) machinery of quantum mechanics has thus led us to a deep, profound understanding of the most remarkable phenomena in the microverse, phenomena that mark striking departures in that world from classical behavior. Such insight is no mean accomplishment , and you should give yourself a little time to savor it. Then read on. *12.4 THE MANY USES OF EIGENFUNCTION EXPANSIONS: TWO EXAMPLES To see how to use the Generalized Born Interpretation and the technique of eigenfunction expansion, let's work a couple of examples . The first is a more realistic (and intricate) version of the examples in Â§ 12.3. The second turns this interpretation on its head to show how we can deduce information about an unknown state function from data obtained in an experiment. Example 12.5. A Non-Stationary State of an Organic Molecule In the problems at the end of Chap. 7, we learned that even the simplest (non-trivial) quantum system-a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well-finds application in the study of nuclei, atoms, and molecules. For example, in Pblm. 7.5 we used such a well to model the hexatriene molecule, a complicated organic molecule that can be approximated by an infinite square well of length L = 7.3 A. Suppose that from the set-up of our experiment , we deduce that the initial state of the electron can be represented by the wave function (with x = 0 at the left wall) (30 w(x,O) = VV x(x - L) . (12.36) In the laboratory, an ensemble measurement of the energy of the particle is performed at t = O. What does the experimentalist find? 550 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions Question 12-5 Verify that this state function is normalized. [You will find it easier to choose the left wall at x = o-see Eq. (12.42) below.] The first thing to notice about this state is that it is not stationary. (Why not?) So the energy of the electron is not sharp (flE > 0), and various members of the ensemble could exhibit one or another of the eigenvalues [Eq. (7.56)] 2 1T 21i 2 En = n 2mL2 n = 1,2, .. . (12.37) Quantization is at hand. Without even analyzing the state, we proclaim that no energies other than the discrete values (12.37) will be seen in the measurement . Since the state is non-stationary, the mean of the observed values is not equal to any of the eigenvalues (12.37) (except by remarkable accident). We can, of course, calculate (E) (0) from the wave function (12.36), viz.,11 (E) (O) = (W(O) Iiii W(O}) =l L w*(x,O}Tw(x,O}dx = -~ 30 l L x(x - L).!f....

L X 2 I L ] â€¢ mL5 3 0 2 0 So the average of the results of the energy measurement will be 51i2 (E) (0) = mL2' (12.38a) (l2.38b) (12.38c) (l2.38d) (12.38e) (12.39) Using L = 7.3 X 10- 10 m, the mass me = 9.1095 x 10- 3 1 kg of the electron, and Planck's constant 1i= 1.0546 X 10- 34 J-sec, we calculate the value (E) (O) = 1.1455 X 10- 19 J = 0.7150 eV. [Note that 1J = 6.2415 X 1018 eV (see Appendix D).] Fine . But suppose we want the probabilities of obtaining one or another of the eigen- values (l2.37)? According to the Generalized Born Interpretation (12.23), these probabilities are the squared moduli of the projections of w(x,O} on the eigenfunctions of the energy operator, ii-which brings us back to the eigenfunction expansion <X w(x ,O} = L Cn(O)1/!n(x }. n=1 We need to evaluate the energy probability amplitudes en(O) = (1/!n IW(OÂ») =l L 1/!;'(x)w(x,O}dx. (12.40) (12.41) 11Notice that in (l2.38b) I integrate from 0 to L, not from -L/2 to L/2. Earlier in this book I argued that when dealing with a symmetric potential we should put the origin of coordinates at the midpoint of the potential. But for this state, the presence of the factors x and x - L in lJI(x,O) argue for the unusual choice of x = 0 for the left wall. In Question 7.7, you converted the eigenfunctions (7.55) to such a coordinate system, finding the functions in Eq. (12.42) below. (Didn 't you?) Sec. 12.4 The Many Uses of Eigenfunction Expansions: Two Examples 551 With x = 0 at the left wall of the potential, the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions are [see Question 7.7] (12.42) (12.43a) (l2.43b) (l2.43c) Aside: Filling in the Gaps. \"Whoa there!\" I hear you cry. \"About those steps between (l2.43a) and (l2.43b) .. . \" Well, okay . This integral is rather more complicated than ones we've done so far, so here's a quick sketch of its evaluation. The first thing to do is to get rid of the unsightly factors of 7f and L parading through the integrand ; we accomplish this by changing the variable of integration from x to u == nsrx]L . This transforms the integral in (12.34a), which I'll call into 31 m , In = (~) 0 u(u-n7f)sinudu L 3 [In\" In\"]= (n7f) 0 u 2 sin u du - n7f 0 u sin u (12.44) (12.45a) duo (l2.45b) (l2.46b) (12.47) (Don't overlook the dependence of the upper limit of integration on n .) Stalking these integrals in various tables, I found i\" u2sinudu=(-1)\"+1(n27f2-2)-2= {-n:7f: neven (12.400) Jo n 7f - 4 n odd I n \" {-n7f n even u sin u du = (-l)\"+ln7f = o n7f n odd Substituting these expressions into (12.45b), I came up with (12.43b). So the energy probability amplitudes (l2.43c) are { O n even cn(O) = _..!..- 8V15 n odd n3 7f3 For this state, only energies that correspond to odd quantum numbers n have non-zero probabilities. So none of the systems in the ensemble will exhibit the energies E2, E4 , E6, . . . . Furthermore, the probab ility of obtaining En (for n odd, of course) is proportional to n- 6 and so drops off very rapidly : e.g., 552 Chap. 12 P(E 1 ) = ICll2 = 0.9986 P(E3) = IC312 = 0.0014 Eigenfunction Expansions (12.48) So most members will exhibit the ground-state energy E l = 0.7057 eV, which is why the mean value, (E) = 0.7150eV, is so close to this energy. But the mean isn't equal to E l , because a few members exhibit the energy of the second excited state, E3 = 6.3509 eV. As a consistency check, let's calculate the mean energy (12.39) from the probability amplitudes, viz., oc (E) (0) = L Icn (0)1 2 En n=l (n odd) ~ ~ (8J15)2 . n2 rr2 1i 2 . L.J n6 rr3 2mL2 n=l (n o d d ) Referring to a table of infinite series, we find the series in (12.49b),12 ~ ~ = 1 + -.!- + -.!- + ... = rr 4 L.J n4 34 54 96 . 11.= 1 n odd (l2.49a) (12.49b) (12.50) (12.51) Hence the ensemble average of the energy at t = 0 is (E) (0) = (8J15)2 rr 2 1i 2 rr 4 = 51i2 rr3 2mL2 96 mL2 ' in happy agreement with (12.39).13 Question 1~ Use the energy probability amplitudes (12.47) to evaluate the energy uncertainty for the state represented by (12.36). The above example was the first in which we had to explicitly evaluate the pro- jections of a state function on the eigenfunctions of the observable being measured. Previously, the projections were handed us on a silver platter, the wave function being already expressed as the appropriate linear combination [ef, Eq. (12.15)]. As well you might imagine, nature is rarely so kind; algebraic contortions like those of this example are typically required to determine the amplitudes. Actually, such problems are usually done backwards. The most common situation in the laboratory is the following: we have in hand the results of one or more ensemble measurements and need to deduce the state function. Let's see how to do this for a simple case. Example 12.6. Deducing the State Function from Measurement Results Consider the following challenge: You are trying to determine the form of the wave function that represents the state of an ensemble of CO molecules. In an energy measurement at t = 0, 70% of the members exhibit E = 0.4035 eV, while 30% exhibit the value E = 0.1345eV. From this information, what can you deduce about the wave function? l 2My favorite such compendium is Table of Integrals and Other Mathematical Data. 4th ed. by H. B. Dwight (New York: Macmillan, 1961), where you'll find this series as Eq. (48.14). 1:IThis example may seem a poor argument for using eigenfunction expansion techniques for evaluating expectation values. To be sure, in this case one could argue, especially if one is unfamiliar with series expansions such as (12.50), that evaluating the integral (\\ 2.38) is the easier approach. Perhaps. (I. however, loath evaluating integrals and will do almost anything to avoid them.) If you still think the integral approach might be easier, try evaluating the uncertainty ~E(O) using the integral form of <E2) (0) . Sec. 12.4 The Many Uses of Eigenfunction Expansions: Two Examples 553 Since we have in hand data about energy, we ought to work in the language of this observable-i.e., in the energy representation of Eq. (12.31). Let's model the CO molecules by a simple harmonic oscillator.l\" We know the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions (Table 9.6) and the molecular data which we need to determine f3 = Jmwo/n. Using liwo = 0.2690eV for CO (see Table 9.1) in the general form of an energy eigenvalue, En = (n + ~)liwo, we deduce that the observed energies are, in fact, Eo and E 1 â€¢ Therefore the initial wave function is a linear combination of the ground- and first-excited state eigenfunctions only, W(x,O) = co(O)'I/Io(x) + C1 (0)'1/11 (x). (12.52) We can determine the initial coefficients CO and C1 in this expansion from the energy data, since the measured probabilities are just the squares of these coefficients: P(Eo) = Icol 2 = 0.30 P(EI) = Icd2 = 0.70. (12.53) Comes now the tricky part. It is incorrect to conclude from this data , as many do , that CO = JO.30 = 0.5477and C1 = JO.70 = 0.8367. Think for a moment; can you figure out why this conclusion is not warranted? The answer is that the projections en are not necessarily real numbers ; they could be, but we would be wrong to deduce from the given data that they are. From the measured energy probabilities we can deduce only the magnitude of these projections, i.e., Equations (12.53) Ico(O)1 = ~ = 0.5477 IC1(0)1 = .fFo= 0.8367 (12.54) This means that we do not fully know the coefficients in the wave function (12.40). In particular, we don't have enough information to determine the phase of either projection. To introduce the phase, I'll write each of these complex numbers in a form containing two as-yet-unknown phase constants which I'll denote by 00 and 01 : co(O) = Ico(O)1 ei 60 C1 (O) = IC1 (O}I e i 61 . Using (12.54) we write the initial wave function (12.52) as15 (12.550) (l2.55b) 14The SHO is a good approximat ion for low-lying vibrational states of this molecule. In Chap. 9 we learned that deep within the potential well of a molecule [see Figs. 9.13 and 9.14) the function V(R) is accurately approximated by the simple harmonic oscillator potential defined with respect to the equilibrium internuclear separation R e , i.e., 1 2 2V(R) ~ -mwo(R - Re) . 2 From the energy data we deduce that in the state in this example, only low-lying vibrational levels are involved. Were this not true, were there a significant probability of obtaining a high-lying energy, we might need more arcane models, such as the Morse potential. 15Actually, only the relative phase of the const ituents of 'lI(x,O) is known. Like any other wave function, this one is indeterminate to within a global phase factor [recall Â§ 3.51, which ('II call 6g lo b . That is. we can write (12.56) as 554 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions (12.56)\\f1(x,O) = Ifoe i6 Â°'I/JO(X) + I\"loei 61 'l/Jl (X). [Note carefully that Eq. (12.56) represents the state of the ensemble of systems before an energy measurement has been performed. Said measurement changes that state (and hence the wave function) in a way we'll discuss in Chap. 13.] In Â§ 12.5, we'll learn how to calculate from this initial function the form of the wave function for any t > O. Question 12-7 Try to guess the state function for t > 0 that evolves from the initial state represented by (12.56). You can probably do this without actually knowing why you are doing what you're doing. Question 12-8 Evaluate the average value of and the uncertainty in the energy from the state function (12.56). Repeat the evaluation, working directly with the energy probability amplitudes. In either case, do the phase factors appear in your final result? Can you ascribe any physical significance to these factors? Additional experiments, in which another observable is measured, are required to determine more about this wave function . We'll consider multiple measurements in Chap . 13. *12.5 COPING WITH THE CONTINUUM According to the Generalized Born Interpretation, the projection of a state function on an eigenfunction of a Hermitian operator is the probability amplitude for obtaining the corresponding eigenvalue in a measurement of the observable represented by that oper- ator. 16 We can apply this interpretation to continuous as well as to discrete spectra, provided we take account of the peculiar nature of the continuum. Recall that some operators, such as IT, define purely discrete spectra; others, such as X, define purely continuous spectra; and still others, such as it for a (sufficiently deep) finite potential well, define mixed spectra, which consist of discrete and continuous eigenvalues. An example of the latter is the symmetric finite square well. Such a well of width L = 1 ao. and depth Vo = 491Â£2/8 [the parameters of Example 8.8] supports four bound stationary states (see Table 8.7), i.e., four of the eigenvalues of its Hamiltonian are discrete . The rest, the eigenvalues for E > Vo, comprise the continuum, as suggested by Fig. 12.4. Into the Continuum To adapt the Born Interpretation to continuous eigenvalues we have only to take into account the fact that they are continuous. For contrast, consider first an observable where the relative phase constant 6.<'1 is just the difference between 6t and 60 in Eq. (12.56). The global phase factor vanishes in the calculation of any measurable quantity and so is irrelevant to the physics of the state represented by this function. t6Be sure you understand all the jargon in, and the meaning of, this intentionally lingo-laden restatement . The words are important. Incidentally, in Chaps . 10 and II , I introduced some of the material in this section (without justification) in footnotes . You need not have read those footnotes to understand this section . but if you skipped them, you probably ought to go back and read them after studying it.

The energies for the well that we analyzed in Example 8.8 are shown as the discrete part of the spectrum. The rest is the continuum. whose spectrum is purely discrete. To evaluate, say, the expectation value of such an observable, we sum [Eq, (12.14Â»), [purely discrete spectrum] (12.57) n being careful to remember that the sum over n must include all discrete eigenvalues of Q. Now, what if the spectrum is purely continuous? Sure. We integrate: (Q) (t) = JP(q,t)qdq. all q [purely continuous spectrum] (12.58) The integral includes all (continuous) eigenvalues of Q. This generalization comes, I hope, as no surprise; it is precisely the method we've been using to evaluate (x) (t) from W(x, t) [see Eq. (12.20Â»). But there is more to the Born Interpretation for continuous eigenvalues than re- placing a sum by an integral. We must also reconsider the meaning of the probability amplitude in an eigenfunction expansion. The quantity Icn(tW in Eq. (12.57), which applies only to a discrete spectrum, is a probability, the probability of obtaining qn in a measurement of Q at t. But the quantity P(q, t) in (12.58) is a probability density for the observable Q, just as P(x, t) = Iw(x, tW in (x) (t) is a probability density for position. To write down this interpretation explicitly, we need the projections of a state function W on the eigenfunctions of Q, which we'll now take to be an operator with a purely continuous spectrum. By analogy with the discrete case [Eq. (12.8); see also Table 12.1], I'll denote these projections by c(q, t) and write the eigenfunction expansion as w(x, t) = Jc(q, t)Xq(x) dq. all q [expansion observable: Q] (12.59) The projection c(q, t) is c(q, t) = (X'I Iw(t)) =i:X~(x)w(x,t) dx, (12.60) as in the discrete case [see Eq. (12.9)]. 556 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions TABLE 12.1 SUMMARY OF FUNDAMENTAL QM EQUATIONS FOR DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS OBSERVABLES.

(12.59) into (12.60) and thereby verify that the two are consistent. Use the fact that eigenfunctions corresponding to continuous eigenvalues satisfy the normalization condition where r5(q' - q} is the Dirac Delta function. Dirac Delta function normalization (12.61) Now, c(q,t) in (12.59) is a probability amplitude for Q, but since the eigenvalues of this operator are continuous, the corresponding probability is Ic(q, tW dq tcf., Â§ 3.3 and 3.5). That is, Piq, t) dq = Ic(q, t)12 dq= probability that in a measurement of Q at time t a member of the ensemble will exhibit a value between q and q+ dq (12.62) That is what we mean when we say Ic(q, tW is a probability density. Aside: Concerning the Position Operator. It may not be obvious how to apply the expansion (12.59) to our most familiar operator, x. The arguments in this section suggest that, for each value Xo of position . the value of the wave function w(xo , t} should be the projection of the state function on an eigenfunction of the Hermitian operator x. But is it? In Â§ 10.5, I noted that the eigenfunctions of x are the Dirac Delta functions [see Eq. (1O.67b)), i.e., xr5(x - xo} = x or5(x - xo}. (l2.63a) (l2.63b) If we use these eigenfunctions for Xq(x} in Eq. (12.60), we get for the projections c(xo, t} =I: r5(x - xo}W(x, t} dx. The effect of the Dirac Delta function in the integral on the right-hand side of this equation is to select from the continuum of possible positions the value x = xo, which gives for the position probability amplitude C(Xo, t} = w(xo , t}. The corresponding probability density is, therefore, (l2.63c) (12.63d) Sec. 12.5 Coping with the Continuum 557 (12.66) Equations (12.63) reveal the Born Interpretation of Chap. 3 (for position) to be a special case of the Generalized Born Interpretation. Momentum Reconsidered One of the most important observables with a purely continuous spectrum is the linear momentum . The eigenvalue equation for the momentum operator p, defines only continuous eigenvalues, the spectrum -00 < P < 00 . Its eigenfunctions [normalized according to Eq. (12.61)] are Xp(x) = J;1r1ie ipx/ h . (12.65) Let's see what happens when we expand an arbitrary wave function in the complete set of eigenfunctions (12.65). This expansion, according to (12.59), is an integral over p: J OC 1 J OO \\II(x, t) = c(p, t) Xp(x) dp = ~ eipx/hc(p, t) dp. -oc v21r1i -oc Note well that in (12.66) we integrate with respect to the eigenvalue p, not with respect to x . That is how the eigenfunction expansion (12.59) works. Equation (12.60) prescribes how to calculate the projection c(p, t) of \\II on the eigenfunction Xp: c(p, t) = (Xp I\\II(t)) =i:X;(x)\\II(x, t) dx. (12.67) (12.68) (Here is where we integrate with respect to x.) Using the explicit form of the eigen- function, this projection becomes suggestively familiar: 1 JOO .c(p, t) = -- e-,px/h \\II(x, t) dx. J21r1i -oc Equations (12.66) and (12.68) look suspiciously like the Fourier transform relations we used in Chap . 4 to go between the position and momentum representations of a state function for a free particle. Compare, for example, Eq. (12.66) to Eq. (4.77a) \\II(x, t) = _1_jOC <p(p) e- iEt/ h eipx/ h dp. (12.69) J21r1i -oc The momentum probability amplitude for a free particle is therefore related to the mo- mentum wave function <p(p) of Chap. 4 by17 c(p,t) = (Xp I\\II(t)) = <p(p)e-iEt/fl . [for a free particle1 (l2 .70a) The momentum wave function itself is just the momentum amplitude at t = 0, i.e., <p(p) = c(p, 0). (l2.70b) 17 We' II explore further the time-dependence of c(p, t) in Â§ 12.8. And in Â§ 12.9 we'll discover that the simple, exponential time dependence in (12.70a) is not a general result; it applies only to systems for which p is a constant of the motion. One such system, as we learned in Chap. 10. is the free particle. 558 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions Question 12-10 Consider a free particle in one dimension in a state represented by a wave packet \\11(x, t) . Substitute the expansion of this state function in momentum eigenfunctions into the time- dependent Schrodinger equation and derive a differential equation for the coefficients c(p, t). Show that your equation is solved by c(p,t) =c(p,O)e- i E t / h . (12.71) We now see that the interpretation of Â«I>(p) as the momentum probability amplitude, which we introduced rather tentatively in Chap. 4, is just an application of the Generalized Born Interpretation (12.62). The probability density for momentum is P(p, t) = Ic(p, tW, (12.72) so for the free particle , the probability of getting a value between p and p + dp in a momentum measurement at any time is P(p, t) dp = Ic(p, tW dp = 1Â«I>(p) e- iEt/hI2 dp = 1Â«I>(p) 1 2 dp. [for a free particle] (12.73a) (12.73b) (12.73c) From this result we can easily regain expressions such as (4.78) for the ensemble average of momentum, Mixed Spectra [for a free particle] (12.74) Mixed spectra, consisting of both discrete and continuous eigenvalues, are quite com- mon in the real (microscopic) world, so I want to discuss briefly the extension of the Generalized Born Interpretation to an operator with a mixed spectrum. This case is very straightforward; all of the basic formulae are just blends of those in Table 12.1. Consider, for example, the finite square well of Fig. 12.4. In an investigation of the energy of an arbitrary state of this system, our first step would be to expand the wave function \\lJ(x, t) in eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. This expansion entails a \"sum\" over all the eigenvalues of if: a true sum over the discrete part and an integral over the continuous part, i.e., \\lJ(x,t) = en(t)\"pn(x) + J all discrete all continuous eigenvalues eigenvalues c(E, t)\"pdx) dE (12.75) For the spectrum in Fig. 12.4, this looks like \\lJ(x, t) = Cl (t)\"pl (x) + C2(t)\"p2(X) + C3(t)\"p3(X) + C4(t)\"p4(X) + (x;, c(E, t)\"pr;(x) dE.i; (12.76) Sec. 12.5 Coping with the Continuum 559 From this expansion we can easily write down expressions for other relevant quantum-mechanical quantities. For example , the probability that in an energy mea- surement at time t a member system will exhibit the value En (for n = I , 2, 3, or 4) is Icn(t)jZ. But the probability that a member will exhibit an energy in the continuum is, for a value between E and E + dE, equal to Ic(E, t)jZ dE. The mean energy obtained in such a measurement would be (E) (t) = IC1(tWEI + IC2(tWE2 + IC3(tWE3 + IC4(tW E4+ I\" Ic(E, tW E dE .i; And so forth. Aha! Insight! (Into Momentum) (12.77) Before we tum to our next trick, solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, let's reflect for a moment on what we have done with momentum. Once again we have knitted into the growing fabric of quantum mechanics a topic encountered earlier in this book. Now, with heightened insight, we know what we are doing. . By applying the techniques of Chaps. 10 and 11 to momentum, we have put the arguments of Chap. 4-which there were based on expediency (the need to introduce a localized wave packet to represent the state of a free particle)-on the rock-solid foundation of quantum theory. When we used the method of eigenfunction expansion to translate the wave function into the language of momentum, we obtained Eq. (12.66), the Fourier transform relationship that we used (in an ad hoc way) in Chap. 4. The reason this equation is the Fourier transform relation is simply that the momentum eigenfunctions (12.65) are precisely the functions that appear in that relation . Ruminate further on the connections between this chapter and Chap. 4 as you ponder the handy summary in Table 12.2.18 TABLE 12.2 TWO VIEWS OF MOMENTUM INFORMATION IN QUANTUM MECHANICS.

But nowhere in this section did we specify a particular system. All our results here apply whether or not the particle is free. But if the particle is free, i.e., if V =0, then Eq. (12.700) takes on a particularly simple form, since for thefree particle only, the energy is related to the momentum by the simple dispersion relation E =p2/(2m) . If, on the other hand, the particle is not free, then Eq. (12.700) still applies, but the relationship of E to p is, to say the least, more complicated . 560 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions (12.78) There is nothing magical or surprising about the appearance here of the formulae of Chap. 4. And it is really quite beautiful how all the elements of quantum mechanics hang together, how the threads of quantum physics from Part II are woven together by the mathematical machinery of Chaps. 10 and 11 to unify quantum theory. Isn't it? (Still, Chap. 13 looms, ominously, on the horizon.) 12.6 THE ARTFUL DODGE: SOLVING THE TDSE THE EASY WAY Wolfe, who had moved around the desk and into his chair, put up a palm at him: \"Please, Mr. Hobart. I think it is always advisable to take a short-cut when it is feasible.\" -The Rubber Band by Rex Stout Using the method of eigenfunction expansion and interpreting the expansion coefficients via the Generalized Born Interpretation , we can extract and understand information about measurement of any observable from a wave function at the time the measurement takes place ... provided we know the wave function . The trouble is, usually we don't. Usually we know at most the Hamiltonian of the system and the initial wave function IIi(x, 0) (see Example 12.6). Without a way to determine IIi(x, t) from this initial function , the whole beautiful edifice of the last five sections becomes all but useless. Since Chap. 6, we have known how to obtain IIi(x, t) formally: just solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation iÂ£IIi = in!.- IIiat subject to the known initial condition. But it is facile to claim that this solves our predicament, for the TDSE is a very nasty equation indeed. Even for merely one par- ticle in merely one dimension, it is a second-order partial differential equation in two variables: 19 (12.79) the solving of which is assuredly not trivial. The one case in which solving (12.79) is trivial is that of a stationary state. If IIi(x, 0) is an eigenfunction of iÂ£ with eigenvalue E, then solutions of the TDSE ex- 19 1 have assumed that we are dealing with a conservative system, so the potential energy in (12.79) doesn't depend on t. [In Volume II we'll implement a similar procedure, albeit in a more subtle way, to cope with non-conservative systems. This step will lead us to a powerful method for calculat ing approximate solutions to complicated time-dependent SchrOdinger equations called time-dependent perturbation theory.] Somewhat less realistically, I'll also assume we have solved the time-independent Schrodinger equation for the system. so we know the eigenfunctions {tPn (x)} and their eigenvalues En. Sec. 12.6 The Artful Dodge: Solving the TDSE the Easy Way 561 ist that are separable into a product of a space-dependent function (the Hamiltonian eigenfunction) and a time-dependent function (the usual exponential time factor): (12.80) But if \\l1(x, 0) is not a Hamiltonian eigenfunction, then \\l1(x, t) is not separable. Understanding this statement is the key to discovering how to conquer non-stationary states . To begin, let's recall that we can expand any wave function at any time in the complete set of eigenfunctions of if. Denoting the projections of this state by cn(t), we have 20 \\l1(x, t) = L en(t)1/Jn(x) n [expansion observable: E 1 (12.81) Although each term in (12.81) is a product of a space-dependent function and a time- dependent function, we must, in general, sum several such terms-maybe an infinite number of terms-in order to obtain a representation of \\l1(x, t) . So this wave function is certainly not separable. To see if we could use this eigenfunction expansion to solve the TDSE, consider the projection cn(t), Cn(t) = (-IPn I\\l1(t)) =i:1/J~(x)\\l1(x,t) dx. (12.82) At first glance, the prospects look grim. To determine \\l1(x, t) from (12.81), we must know the projections at time t. But according to (12.82), to determine these projections we must know the very function we seek, \\l1(x, t). On further reflection, we realize that Eq. (12.81) is a boon. Think about what happens if we substitute this expans ion for \\l1(x, t) in the TDSE (12.79). The Hamiltonian acts on each eigenfunction in this sum, returning En1/Jn(x ) and thereby eliminating from the Schriidinger equation the derivatives with respect to x . What results is a set of equations in the time variable only for the projections cn(t), equations that are very easy to solve. Once we know the projections as functions of time, we know the state function (12.81). We have solved the TDSE without actually solving the TDSE! Let's now work out this wizardry in detail. Equations for the EnergyAmplitudes First we substitute the expansion (12.81) into the TDSE (12.78), viz., if L Cn' (t)1/Jn' (x) = ili :t L Cn' (t)1/Jn' (x) . n' n' (12.83) [So my final result, Eq. (12.88), will look pretty I'm using n' for the (dummy) summation index in this derivation.] The Hamiltonian does not alter functions of t only, just as a/at does not alter functions of x only, so we can write (12.83) as 20To simplify the notation, I'll assume that the energy spectrum is purely discrete, so the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be labelled by n = 1,2, . . . . Results analogous to those of this section can be written down for continuous and mixed spectra using the generalizations of Â§ 12.5. 562 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions I:Cn,(t)H-rPn'(x) = inL -rPn/(x) :tCn/(t) . n' n' When the Hamiltonian acts on its eigenfunctions, this equation simplifies to (l2.84a) (l2.84b) Fine. How can we extract from (12.84b) an equation for a single projection cn(t)? We must somehow evaluate the sums over n' so as to select n' = n, and we must get rid of the x-dependent functions, the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions . Evidently, we need a Dirac Delta function. And I'll bet you know where we can get one. Orthonormality. The x-dependent functions in this equation are eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator and hence are orthonormal, i.e., (12.85) To exploit this handy fact, we multiply both sides of (l2 .84b) by -rP~(x) and integrate the resulting equation over all values of x. From this point, I'm sure you can follow the rest of the derivation: L Cn,(t)En'VJ~(x)-rPnl(x)= inL -rP~(x)VJn/(X)d~;' (12.800) n' n ' ~cn,(t)En,i:VJ~(x)-rPnl(x)dx = in ~ d~;'i:VJ~(X)-rPn/(X)dx (12.86b) n n Encn(t) = ind;; . (l2.86c) Equation (l2.86c) is e first-order, ordinary differential equation for the projection cn(t) of the state IJ1 at time t on the Hamiltonian eigenfunction VJn(x): n = 1,2, .. . (12.87) There is one such equation for each eigenfunction VJn(x). Integrating both sides of Eqs. (12.87) from the initial time t = 0, we obtain their solutions n = 0,1,2, . . . \\ (12.88) Well, that result certainly is simple. And it leads straight to the solution of the TDSE for time t. Here's why. We can calculate the projections ClI at t = 0 from the initial wave function, which (by hypothesis) we know: Cn (0) = (VJn 1 1J1(0) = i:VJ~(x)lJ1(x, 0) dx. n = 1,2, . . . (12.89) Sec. 12.6 The Artful Dodge: Solving the TDSE the Easy Way 563 Having done so, we merely multiply each projection by the familiar time factor e- iEnt/h and voila! The expansion (12.81) is the desired wave function. Before going on, let's cogitate a bit. The coefficients {cn(O), n = 1,2 ,3, .. . } of (12.89) represent the state \\II (in the energy representation). The simple equation (12.88) telIs us how to \"propagate\" the state to any time t > O. From the energy representation of the state at this time we can easily determine the position representation, the wave function \\II(x, t) , via our original expansion, Eq. (12.81). So by \"translating\" the problem of finding the wave function from its initial condi- tion into the language of energy , we have dodged entirely the onerous chore of solving the TDSE! We now have two ways to solve the fundamental problem of quantum mechanics, one direct, the other roundabout: Position Representation ~ , i... \\II(x, 0) 1 H\\II = in~\\IIat 1 \\II(x, t) Energy Representation , I.. {cn(O) = (1/Jn I \\II(0)) } 1 1 \\II(x , t) = Ln Cn(t)1/Jn(x) Example 12.7. Easy Evaluation of State Functions In Â§ 12.4 we left unfinished two applications of the Generalized Born Interpretation. In Example 12.5 we cons idered a hexatrine molecule, modeled by an infinite square well, in a non-stationary state. To predict the possible outcomes of an energy measurement (at t = 0) on this system, we expanded the initial wave function in Hamiltonian eigenfunctions, obtaining {30 ~ ( 1 8V15)W(x,O)=VVx(x-L)= ~ -n 3 ---;;:3 VJn(X). n odd (12.90) From that example, we have all the information needed to write down the solution of the TDSE for any time t > O. We have determined the projections of this state at t = 0, and , from Chap . 7, we know the eigenvalues En = n2 1r21i,2/(2mL2). Ergo the wave function is W(x,t) = ~ (-:'18~) VJn(X)e- iEnt/h . n o d d (12.91) In the second example of Â§ 12.4, Example 12.6, we deduced from energy mea- surements on an ensemble of CO molecules that the (non-stationary) initial state could be represented by the wave function [Eq. (12.56)] (12.92) where 60 and 61 are (unknown) phase constants. I then asked you to guess the form of the wave function for t > O. I hope you guessed 564 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions lIJ(x,O) = !\"foei601/Jo(X)e- iWOt/2 + [\"l;e i611/Jl(X)e-i3wot/2, for, as we now know, this is the correct answer. Almost embarrassingly easy, isn't it? The Physics of Expansion In Hamiltonian Eigenfunctions (12.93) The solution of the TDSE by expansion in Hamiltonian eigenfunctions is, as you might imagine, a wonderful problem-solving too\\. But it is also rich with important physics. For one thing, it clearly reveals the explicit connection between the initial condition and the state function : (12.94) n Equation 12.94 is a succinct mathematical statement of causality in quantum mechanics (c f., Chap. 6). Recall that in the microscopic world, cause and effect take on a strange new form: the only true causality is between complex functions at different times, functions that do not themselves have any physical reality. We now see that the wave function depends on its progenitor, the initial state, in a very special way: through the initial energy probability amplitudes ('l/Jn IW(O)}. For another thing, the expansion (12.94) returns us to one of the most important underpinnings of quantum physics: the Principle of Superposition. To highlight this feature, let's write Eq. (12.94) in terms of the stationary-state wave functions (12.80), W(x, t) = L cn(O) Wn(x, t) . n (12.95) From this vantage point, we view the projections cn(O) as \"mixture coefficients\" in the superposition of stationary states that is the non-stationary state represented by W(x,t) . Question 12-11 Redo the above derivation for the special case that lIJ(x,O) is an eigenfunction of it-say , with eigenvalue Em. Explain briefly why, as claimed earlier in this section, separability of lIJ(x, t) follows only in this special case. I have boxed Eqs. (12.81), (12.94), and (12.95) to emphasize the importance of thinking about and remembering all of these perspectives on eigenfunction expansions . They tie the findings of this chapter to the rest of quantum mechanics . We have known since first we laid out the postulates of quantum physics (Part II) that inherent in a (general) wave function are many possible outcomes of an energy measurement-not, as we know now, arbitrary outcomes, but rather many eigenvalues of fl. This is the essence of the concept of a superposition state. The probability that upon measurement at t, a member system will actually exhibit one of these values is also buried in the wave function-and we now know how to get at it. Aside: The Energy and Other Representations. It is very important to under- stand the critical role played by the energy representation in our simplification of the TDSE. We could have expanded lIJ(x, t) in the complete set of eigenfunctions of any Hermitian operator-say, {Xq(x)} of some operator Q. But substitution of Sec. 12.6 The Artful Dodge: Solving the TDSE the Easy Way 565 the resulting expansion into the TDSE would lead to a far more complicated set of equations for the projections cn(t). In Â§ 12.9 we'll pursue this matter further, deriving the following equations for the projections of \\If on eigenfunctions of an arbitrary observable Q: ~Cn(t)= -~L(Xn Iill Xn,)cn,(t) . n' n = 1,2,3, .. . (12.96) See the problem? The equation we must solve for a parti cular projection, say Cn (t)-, is coupled by matrix elements of il to equations for other projections, Cn' (t) . Such sets of coupled equations can be solved, as we'll learn in Volume II, but only with considerably more exertion than is necessary if we choose Q= il for our expansion. Question 12-12 Derive Equations (12.96). What simplifications to these equations, if any, follow in the special case that the observable Q is a constant of the motion? Implications for Energy Measurements In this section I have emphasized the role of the projections cn(t) = (1/Jn I \\l1(t)) as tools for solving the Schrodinger equation . But, of course, these quantities are also energy probability amplitudes, and their special form, Cn(t) = en(0) e- iEnt/h, tells us something important about energy measurements: their results don 't depend on time. In such a measurement , the probability of obtaining an eigenvalue En is P(En ) = len(t)12 = len(O) e- iEnt/1i12 = IclI (0)1 2 â€¢ (l2 .97a) (l2.97b) (l2.97c) It's clear what happened to the time. Because of the special, complex exponential form of the time factor in the energy probability amplitudes, the squared moduli of these amplitudes-the energy probabilities-care independent of the measurement time. Be care- ful : this result does not pertain to probabilities for an arbitrary observable . A convenient summary contrasting the energy-related properties of stationary and non-stationary states appears in Table 12.3. Question 12-13 Use the form of the energy probability amplitudes and Eq. (12.18) for the ensemble average of energy to prove that the energy of a conservative microscopic system is conserved. An Exhortation I hope the discussion in this section-and the example in Â§ 12.6-will convince you of the power of the method of eigenfunction expansion as a tool for solving the TDSE. The good news is that this method can be applied to a wide variety of differential equations. Look carefully at the steps. We expanded a function [\\l1(x, t)) of two variables (x and t) in a complete set in one of the variables (x) . We then substituted the expansion into the multi-variable partial differential equation for the function (the TDSE) and used orthonormality of the complete set [{1/J...(x)} 1to eliminate entirely one variable (x). The result was a set of simpler equations in a single variable. 566 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions TABLE 12.3 ENERGY-RELATED INFORMATION CONCERNING STATIONARY AND NON-STATIONARY STATES.

These steps can easily be extended to other partial differential eCluations, in more than two variables, and to complete sets of observables other than 1-Â£. The only re- quirement is that the operator that defines the complete set be Hermitian, so that the eigenfunctions in the set are orthogonal. In the interests of honesty, I should note that we have greatly simplified the math- ematical problem, but at a certain cost. Rather than face a single multi-variable partial differential equation, we must cope with a set of single-variable ordinary differential equations . But solving the latter is (almost) always simpler than solving the former- which is what makes this method so powerful. Anyway, my message is: the technique of subduing partial differential equations via expansion in a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions is one of the two or three most powerful weapons in a physicist's armament. It will get you out of tight spots time and time again, not just in quantum phys ics, but in almost every physics course you take. Do not fail to commit it to memory . *12.7 THE AMAZING EXPANDING SQUARE WELL (AN EXAMPLE) Science isn't certainty, Sergo, it's probability. -John Bishop in Artifact by Gregory Benford I now want to introduce one of the most remarkable, confounding examples in quantum physics: the effect on an observable-here, the energy-of a sudden change in the potential of a system. The system we'll consider, a particle in an infinite square well, is very simple; but nonetheless, the behavior it manifests is a paradigm for complicated physical processes such as beta decay. Stay alert. This one will test your quantum intuition to the fullest. First, let's apply our classical intuition to a macroscopic counterpart of this system. Suppose a billiard ball (of mass m) bounces elastically (in one dimension) between the Sec. 12.7 The Amazing Expanding Square Well (An Example) 567 fixed walls of a box of width L, as in Fig. 12.5a.2 1 The particle, being macroscopic, has an energy, which depends on its velocity v as E = mv 2 / 2. At t = 0 the right wall suddenly moves to the right, causing the box to expand-to be specific, suppose it moves from x = L to x = 3L, as in Fig. 12.5b. (By \"sudden,\" I mean effectively instantaneous-i.e., the change in the potential occurs during so short a time interval that, in effect, the position of the particle can be considered unchanged during the expansion.) What happens to the energy of the particle? Right-absolutely nothing. The particle's energy is independent of the size of the box, so the expansion has no effect on it. The particle just traverses a larger orbit as it bounces back and forth in the expanded box. ~--O----1 (a) ~--O----------1 (bl An Expansion in the Mlcroverse Figure 12.5 A bouncing macroscopic ball in one dimension (a) before and (b) after a sudden change at t = 0 in the position of the right wall. As a consequence of this change in the potential. the trajectory of the particle changes (in a predictable way), but its total energy does not change. (12.98) Consider now a microscopic box, the infinite square well of width L shown in Fig. 12.6a.22 A particle in an energy eigenstate at t=O has a well-defined energy En=n 21f2Ti,2/(2mL2). If nothing happens to the system , the state evolves just like any other stationary state : at t > 0 the wave function is wn(x, t) = 1/Jn(x)e-iEnt/li. At any time, the state is an energy eigenstate, and an energy measurement will yield the value En with zero uncertainty. The mean of the results of such a measurement is (E) (t) = En. Simple enough. But suppose the system changes (instantaneously) at t = O. To keep the analysis simple, let's set up the initial condition (before the change) so that the particle is in the ground stationary state of the well of width L; i.e.,23 Il'(x, 0) = 1/J~L)(x)= Ii sin (1f~). Outside the box, of course, this wave function is zero. At t = 0 the box suddenly expands, as in Fig. 12.6b, the right wall abruptly moving to x = 3L. What is the state of the particle at some time after the sudden expansion? Is it still an energy eigenstate? What is its wave function? 21In one of those idealizations so beloved of textbook authors, we could imagine the ball sliding without frict ion along a perfe ctly straight wire in the absence of gravity . The perfectly elastic collision, too. is an idealization. 22For consistency with Example 12.5, I'll put x = 0 at the left wall of the box. Obviously, the physics of the states of the system doesn't depend on where I put the origin of coordinates. 2:lBecause we will consider two square wells of different widths. I'll label the Hamiltonian eigenfunc- tions and eigenvalues, the stationary state energies, with a superscript that indicates the width of the well. 568 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions i__ 'o V=co (a) (b) V=co 3L Figure 12.6 The infinite square well: (a) before and (b) after a sudden expansion at t = O. As a consequence of this change in the potential energy. the state of the particle (not shown) changes in strange and remarkable ways. Erroneous Answers Some novice quantum mechanics answer the last question with the wave function for the original well, .,p~L)(x)e-iE~L)t/li, arguing that since the initial state was an energy eigenstate of the \"unexpanded well,\" so should be the subsequent state. This answer should make you very nervous. The equation that governs evolution of the state from the moment of expansion to time t is the time-dependent Schrodinger equation of the expanded well, i.e., the Hamiltonian of this system is that of the expanded well, not of the initial well. 24 The point is that .,p~L)(x) is not an eigenfunction of this Hamiltonian, so the wave function .,p~L)(x)e-iE~L)t/1i is not appropriate to the expanded well. Abandoning this guess, we might look for guidance at the allowed energies of the particle after expansion. From Â§ 12.4 we know that these values are just the eigenvalues of a well of width 3L, 21i,2 ....21i,2 E(3L) _Â·2 7r Â·2 .. j - J 2m(3L)2 = J 18mÂ£2' j = 1,2,3, . .. (12.99) 24 For the expanding square well. the difference between the systems before and after expansion is the boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions . e.g., for a well of width L: for a well of width 3L : { 1/J~L)(x= 0) = 0 1/J~L)(x= L) = 0 This is, I admit. an unfortunate (although minor) complicating feature of this example . It does not arise if we consider. say, a simple harmonic oscillator whose natural frequency suddenly changes at t = O. Sec. 12.7 The Amazing Expanding Square Well (An Example) 569 The corresponding eigenfunctions are .,.(3L)() (2. ( . X) o/j X = V3i sm J1r3L . j = 1,2,3, . . . (12.100) Energy level diagrams for wells of width Land 3L are shown side by side in Fig. 12.7. Lo and behold. the energy of the particle before expansion - the ground state energy E~L) = 1r2r,,2j(2mL2) of the well of width L-is equal to the energy of the second excited state (j = 3) of the expanded well. E~3L). From this observation. one might guess that the system at t > 0 is in the second excited state of the expanded well and that consequently its state function is 1/J~3L)(x)e-iE~3L)t/h.

The purely accidental coincidence of E~L) and (3L)E3 can lead the unwary astray. 570 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions Question 12-14 Before you read further . work this very simple exercise. Suppose the well expands at t = 0 to a width of 3L/2. Write down the equation for the allowed energies E?L/2) . For what value of j does ElL) coincide with one of these allowed energies? Now answer the question I posed above. This guess should trouble you. Underlying it is the assumption that the state of the particle at t > 0 that evolves from the initial condition \\If(x, 0) = 7/J~L)(x) is identical to the state that would have evolved from the initial condition \\If(x, 0) = 7/J~3L)(x). The latter initial wave function would be appropriate only if the width of the well had always been 3L. But that's not right: those aren't the circumstances of the problem. Initially our particle wasn't in an expanded well; it was in a well of width L. Surely this fact will affect the state after expansion. The Correct Answer Evidently something rather subtle is going on. Simple intuitive arguments are leading us astray. We would be well advised, then, to analyze this problem systematically, sticking rigorously to the procedure for solving the TDSE we laid out in Â§ 12.6. The analysis isn't mysterious, but it does demand care and thought at each step. At the heart of our procedure is the expansion of the state function in eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian . The coefficients in that expansion , the projections of \\If on these eigenfunctions , have a simple exponential time dependence that is determined from the initial wave function and the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The only tricky part is determining which eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to use. Let's see how this goes. After expansion, the width of the box is 3L, so we should expand \\If(x,t) in eigenfunctions (12.100), i.e., (12.101)[expansion observable: E 1 00 \\If(x,t) = LCj(t)7/Jj3L)(x) . j=l The projections Cj(t) are proportional to an exponential that includes the eigenvalues of the expanded we1l 25 ' E ( 3 L ) In Cj(t)=cj(O)e- t j '!\", j=1 ,2,3, . .. (12.102) Comes now the tough question : what is the expression for the projections Cj(O)? According to Eq. (12.89) the lh projection is the integral over all space of the complex conjugate of the lh eigenfunction of the expanded well times the initial wave function (12.98): Cj(O) = (7/J?L) I\\If(0) = I: 7/J?L)*(x) \\If(x, 0) dx L = 1 7/J?L)*(X)7/J~L)(x)dx.

Do not pass this point until you understand it. Sec. 12.7 The Amazing Expanding Square Well (An Example) 571 There are two possible traps in Eqs. (12.103). First, we must carefully follow the prescription of Â§ 12.6 and insert for the initial wave function in (12.103b) the ground- state eigenfunction of the unexpanded well (not an eigenfunction of the expanded well). Second, the limits of integration on the integral in (12.103b) are changed in (12.103c), for this integral is cut off at x = 0 and x = L by the initial wave function (12.98), which is zero outside the box. (Even fairly adept quantum mechanics sometimes goof up the limits of integration in problems like this one.) The rest is algebra. Now we must evaluate the projections Eq. (12.103c), (12.104) (12.105) The obvious thing to do at this point is to change the variable of integration from x to U == 7rxjL, viz., () ali L 1\" .

A trip to your friendly neighborhood integral table yields j=3 (12.106) Aside: Filling in the Gaps. Want to see the details? There's not much to them. First we combine the sine functions, using a familiar trig identity, to obtain for the integral in (12.105) t, ==1\"sin e;)sin udu (12.107a) = ~[1\"cos e;-u) du -1\"cos e;+u) dU] (12.107b) = ~ [sin a-I) 1T _ sin a+ 1) 1T] . j =1= 3 (12.107c) 2 j - 3 j+ 3 The integral for j = 3 is particularly simple: fa =1\"sin 2 udu = ~. (l2.107d) The integral for j =1= 3 is not particularly simple, so let's simplify it. Manipulating the sine functions in (12.107c) (more trig identities) and putting both terms over (j - 3)(j + 3) = l - 9. we obtain j=l=3 sin (~1T) I j = -9 j2 _ 9 . Equations (12.107d) and (12.108) lead immediately to (12.106). (12.108) 572 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions The projections (12.106), when multiplied by the exponential time factors and the appropriate Hamiltonian eigenfunctions , determine the wave function \\If(x, t) at any t > 0 [Eq. (12.101)]. Clearly, more than one of these projections are non-zero (in fact, an infinite number of them are non-zero) . So the state represented by this function is not stationary, i.e., it is not an energy eigenstate. Question 12-15 Write out the first five terms in the expansion for w(x , t), using explicit expressions for the energies and eigenfunctions. The projections (12.106) are also the representation of the state \\If in the language of energy-i.e., they are the energy probability amplitudes. The number ICj(OW is the probability that in an energy measurement at t > 0 on this state of the particle in the expanded well, we'll obtain the eigenvalue E?L). I've tabulated some of these energies and their respective probabilities in Table 12.4.

Before the well expanded, the particle had a (sharp) energy E~L) = 1r2h? j(2mL2) . What is the probability of a member particle exhibiting this value in an energy measurement at t > 0, after expansion? This energy is E~3L),and according to Table 12.4 the corresponding probability is p(E~3L)) = 0.333. Hmmm . .. not even 50% of the systems in our ensemble exhibit this energy.P\" Some energies, such as E~3L), although \"allowed,\" do not appear in an 26Note carefully: a member that exhibits this energy in a measurement at t > 0 was not (immediately prior to the measurement) in an energy eigenstate with this energy. We know from the distribution of energies in Table 12.4 that the state of the ensemble immediately before we measure the energy is not an energy eigenstate (recall Table 12.3): the energy uncertainty is positive [LlE(t) > 01 for t > O. (We'll consider the energy uncertainty. which exhibits some disqu ieting behavior, in a minute.) Sec. 12.7 The Amazing Expanding Square Well (An Example) 573 energy measurement on this state, because the projections of the state function on the corresponding eigenfunctions are zero. Still, rather a lot of energies do show up in the measurement. The probabilities p(EJ 3 Ll) appear to drop off rapidly with increasing j . Nonetheless-and contrary to our classical intuition-there is a small chance that a member of the ensemble will exhibit an energy much larger than the particle 's value prior to expansion of the well. Statistical Quantities of the Expanded Well The sudden change in the potential at t = 0 brought about a radical change in the quantum state of the particle in the well. To gain further insight into this change, let's compute the average value and uncertainty in the energy at t > O. Their initial values, of course, are (E) (0) = E~Ll LlE(O) = 0 [before expansion] . (12.109) Unfortunately, this calculation is complicated whether we use the integral or series forms of the required expectation values, (E) and (E2). In such cases, a physicist will sometimes abandon the quest for the exact values of these quantities and settle for numerical approximations to them. One could compute such approximations either by integrating numerically the integral forms (quadrature) or by summing a finite number of terms in each series. In the latter case, we must include enough terms to identify the value to which the sum is tending with increasing number of terms. Because we have not considered this gambit before, I want to show you how to evaluate the mean value and uncertainty in the energy by summing truncated series in the energy amplitudes Cj (0). Question 12-16 Write down explicit expressions for the integral forms of (E) (0) and (E 2 ) (0) for the state of the system after expansion. Why are the values of these quantities not equal to Eqs. (l2.109)? The series for (E) and (E 2 ) include an infinite number of terms [see Table 12.3] unless the projections Cj(O) have a very special behavior: unless there exists a \"maximum value\" jmax beyond which all coefficients Cj (0) are zero. Examining (12.106) we find that, unhappily , this is not the case for the problem at hand. We could, of course, try to sum the resulting expressions exactly using the theory of infinite series, and in this simple case that strategem would work. But suppose it didn't. Or suppose we can't figure out the answer. Or suppose we have an answer and want to check it. In any case, we would like to estimate the values of (E) and LlE. To get an idea of these values, we'll \"truncate\" the infinite series for (E) and (E 2 ) at a fairly small number of terms and see what we get. That is, we'll introduce a terminal value jmax and calculate 574 Chap. 12 j mnx (E) = L ICj(O)l2 e, j=l jUl nx (E 2 ) = L ICj(0)1 2 Ef. j=l Eigenfunction Expansions (12.1IOa) (12.1IOb) Then the uncertainty follows from the usual formula (l2.llOc) The results of these calculations for increasing values of jmax appear in Fig. 12.8. Figure 12.8 Finite-series approximations to the average energy (solid curve) and the energy uncertainty (dashed curve) for the state represented by the energy amplitudes (12.106). The horizontal axis shows the maximum value of j included in the series for (E) and (E2 )-see Eqs. (12.110). Note that the units of the vertical axis are 1r2h 2/ (2m L 2 ). Therefore 1.0 on the vertical axis is the value ElL) of the energy of the particle before the well expands. Let's look first at the mean energy. The trend is clear. As the number of terms in (l2.110a) increases, the average energy approaches the value 1r2 1;,2j(2mÂ£2), i.e., 21;,2 (E) I ~ . (l2.111a) i m\"x.....oc 2mL Remarkably, this is the energy of the particle before the well expanded at t = 0, i.e., the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian of the well of width L that corresponds to the initial condition IIJ(x,O) = 1/J~L)(x).27 27Th is result is not a fluke. Had the particle initially been in any eigenstate of the well of width L. with energy E!.L), its mean value at t > 0, after expansion, would be (E) = E~L) [for the expanded well]. This result holds no matter what the width of the expanded well. [See J. G. Cordes. D. Kiang, and 1. Nakajima. Amer. Jour. Phys., 52, 155 (1984).] Sec. 12.7 The Amazing Expanding Square Well (An Example) 575 Equally remarkable-and far more alarming-is the behavior displayed in Fig. 12.8 by the uncertainty flE : as the number of terms included in (E) and (E2) increases, the uncertainty seems to diverge! Indeed, a detailed numerical analysis shows that flE ) 00. i m ax -+ OO (12.111b) [The same distressing behavior is found if the particle is initially in any eigenstate of the unexpanded well-i.e., for \\l1(x,O) = 1/J~L)(x). The energy uncertainty of the state after expansion is finite only if the initial state is non-stationary . (See Pblm. 12.4.)] As a consequence of the expansion, the particle has wound up in a state of maximal energy uncertainty. Question 12-17 Verify Eqs. (12.110) and the appalling Eqs. (12.111) by continuing the analysis in Fig. 12.8 to at least imax = 20. Question 12-18 1. Look at Fig. 12.7. Where, in relation to the energy levels of the system before expansion, is the energy of the most probable state after expansion? 2. Does the mean value of the energy change as a consequence of the expansion? Can you figure out why or why not? 3. We've seen that some members of the ensemble will exhibit an energy after expansion that is greater than the energy of the system before expansion. Discuss the implications of this finding for the law of conservation of energy. This example will repay your careful perusal and considered contemplation. In addition to rather elaborately illustrating the powerhouse method of eigenfunction expan- sion, it illustrates the nest of counter-intuitive phenomena into which quantum mechanics sometimes leads us. And it reminds us of the marvels and wonders that await us in the microworld. *12.8 MOMENTUM REDUX: THE CASE OF THE CONTINUUM CONTINUED Earlier in this chapter we learned how to use the Generalized Born Interpretation to extract probabilistic information from state functions (Â§ 12.2-12.5). We also learned how to use the method of eigenfunction expansion to obtain these functions from the TDSE (Â§ 12.6-12.7) and how to translate them into the languages of various observables. These strategies are among the most important in this book. Here I want to tie them together with an example in which we contend with a more general problem and a more general quantum state than that of the previous section. Consider a simple harmonic oscillator that is initially in a non-stationary state represented by the (initial) wave function \\l1(X,0).28 Suppose that at time t > 0, the linear momentum of the oscillator is measured . We want to predict the probability that a member of an ensemble of such oscillators will give a value between p and p + dp. How do we proceed? Ultimately we must get our hands on the momentum probability 211ln Â§ 9.10 we treated one such state-a \"sloshing \" state-and discovered the periodic behavior of its position probability and properties. For deep insight into sloshing states, see Pblm. 12.5. 576 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions amplitude c(P,t), for the squared modulus of this quantity is the probability density we need. But this problem is complicated by the difficulty in determining the wave function at time t from which we calculate this amplitude. That is, first we must determine the wave function W(x, t) at the measurement time, from the initial condition W(x,O). Different languages are appropriate to each of these steps: Step 1. Solve the TDSE: use the energy representation (Â§ 12.5). Step 2. Predict results of momentum measurement: use the momentum repre- sentation (Â§ 12.4). Let's take up with the second task first. According to the Generalized Born Inter- pretation, we can calculate the momentum probability density from the representation of the state Win the language of momentum, i.e., Pip, t) = Ic(p, tW. (12.112) The projection c(p, t) of the state Won a momentum eigenfunction XP with eigenvalue p-the momentum probability amplitude-appears in the eigenfunction expansion [expansion observable : Pl,W(x, t) = I: c(p, t)xp(X) dp and is related to the wave function at time t by (12.113a) c(p, t) = (Xp I W(t)). (12.113b) We know the momentum eigenfunctions in (12. 113a); they are the familiar pure- momentum-state functions of Eq. (12.65). But what about the state function at t > O? The easiest way to determine this function is to work in the language of energy (Â§ 12.6). We can easily write down the solution of the TDSE using the energy represen- tation of the state, viz., oo w(x, t) = L cn(O) e- iEnt/li1/Jn(x) n=O [expansion observable : E] . (12.114) (12.115)n = 0, 1,2, . . . The energies in the exponential time factor are En = (n + ~)nwo The Hamiltonian eigenfunctions 1/Jn(x) are those of Table 9.6. And the projections of the initial state on these energy eigenfunctions are n=0,1 ,2, .. . . (12.116) One important feature of Eqs. (12.114}--{12.116) may seem obvious when I state it but is a frequent source of confusion: the energy probability amplitudes cn(t) = cn(O)e-iE\"t/1i are not the same as the momentum probability amplitudes c(p, t). The two sets {cn(O) ;n = 1,2, . .. } and {c(p, t); -00 < p < oo} represent the the same state in different languages. Just as words that represent the concept \"love\" in French (amour) and in English are different, so the quantities that represent the state Win the languages of momentum and energy are different. But it's easy to derive a relationship between the two representations by substi- tuting the expansion in energy eigenfunctions, Eq. (12.114), into the expression for the momentum amplitude, Eq. (12.113b); to wit: Sec. 12.8 Momentum Redux: The Case of the Continuum Continued sn 00 cip, t) = L ClI(O) e-iEnt/T, (Xl) I 'l/J1I) ~ n=O~ language of language of momentum energy (12.117) Notice that c(p, t) does not have the simple form of a constant times e- i E t / h . This simple form obtains only in special cases, such as a stationary state.

[system in m 1h stationary state] (12.118) .Example 12.8. Momentum Measurements on a SUO Let's get specific. To make life easier. suppose we are handed the expansion of the wave packet \\II(x, 0) in Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. (12.119) This function represents the state in the position representation . Its representation in the language of energy. which we'lI use to solve the TDSE. is therefore 1 co(O) = J2 1 c}(O) = J2 c\"(O) = O. n > 1 (12. 120a) (l2.120b) (12.120c) Question 12-20 Write down the wave function (in the position representation) that represents this state at times t > O. Question 12-21 In an energy measurement at t > O. what values would be found. and with what probabilities? Now. to predict the results of a measurement of momentum. we insert the energy amplitudes (12.120) into Eq. (12.117) for the momentum amplitude c(p, t). which reduces to just two terms. There remains only to evaluate the integrals (Xl' It/J,,) = ~jX; e-il\"PI t/J,,(x)dx v 211'1i -'J(, (l2.12Ia) (l2.12Ib) (12.122) 578 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions for n = 0 and I. This explicit expression reveals these integrals to be the inverse Fourier transforms ofthe Hamiltonian eigenfunctions tP1I (x), a result we could have anticipated from Chap . 4. For n = 0 and n = 1, the particular cases that appear in (12.121), these integrals are easily evaluated, by recourse to a Table of Fourier Transforms, as2!1 (l2.123a) (12.123b) The constant f3 is (Table 9.3) f3 = Jmwo/h. We can now calculate the probability of obtaining a value of momentum between p and p + dp. We merely insert the integrals (12.123) into our expression for the momentum probability amplitude, Eq. (I2.12Ib); multiply the resulting (complex) quantity c(p, t) by its complex conjugate; and then multiply the result by dp. You should be able to see without going through the algebra that pep, t) does depend on time. When c(p, t) is multiplied by c' (p, t) , the resulting probability density contains \"cross terms\" that oscillate with time. This time-dependent momentum probability density contrasts strikingly with the momentum density for a stationary state, which quantity is independent of t. Question 12-22 For the state (12.119), derive an expression for P(p, t) (in terms of (XI> I X,,), the natural frequency of the oscillator wo, the particle mass m, and fundamental constants) that explicitly displays the time dependence of this probability density . Question 12-23 Do the mean momentum (p) and the uncertainty l:i.pfor a non-stationary state depend on time? Why or why not? How does this behavior differ from that for a stationary state? The general expression (12.117) can be applied to any non-stationary state, so the arguments of Example 12.8 imply that the momentum probability density for such a state does depend on time. A final thought: In problem solving we get a lot of mileage by translating the TDSE into the energy representation. And you may have wondered if it is possible to translate the TDSE into the language of an arbitrary observable. Of course it is; the 2!Jln this evaluation, the parity of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions simplifies the algebra.

Sec. 12.8 Momentum Redux: The Case of the Continuum Continued 579 momentum representation is a common example.i'? But in practice such translations are rare because-as you learned in Question 12.9-the resulting equations for the projections of the state on eigenfunctions of an observable other than energy do not simplify as did the equations for the energy projections (Â§ 12.6). Nevertheless, the procedure of translating quantum-mechanical equations and prob- lems into various representations is a powerful one. First described in its full mathe- matical glory by P. A. M. Dirac (who in 1926 earned the first PhD ever awarded for research in quantum mechanics), this method has been codified using the mathematics of matrices, transformations, and linear algebra into the predominant problem-solving technique of quantum physics .:'! You will, I hope, have a chance to study it in your next quantum course. 12.9 FINAL THOUGHTS: CONSTANTS OF THE MOTION RECONSIDERED You is feeling like you was lost in the bush, boy? You says: It is a puling sample jungle of woods. You most shouts out: Bethicket me for a stump of a beech if I have the poultriest notions what the farest he all means. Gee up, girly! -F innegan's Wake by James Joyce In Â§ 12.8 we discovered that the momentum probability density for a non-stationary state changes with time. Earlier in this chapter we ascertained that the energy probabilities for such a state do not depend on time. The obvious question raised by these findings is: Is energy the only observable whose probabilities (for an arbitrary state) are time- independent? The answer is no. As we're about to prove, the probabilities for the energy and all other constants of the motion of a system are independent of time. Once again, the proof uses the method of eigenfunction expansion. First, a brief review . In Chap . lOwe defined a constant of the motion as an observable that is compatible with the energy. Such an observable is represented by an operator that commutes with if. [Eq. (l1.74)]. We then proved (Â§ 11.6) that a constant of the motion in quantum mechanics is conserved, i.e., its mean value in any state doesn't depend on time: [if.,Q] = 0 d dt (Q) (t) = O. [any state Ill] (l2.124) 30In Pblm . 9.16 I asked you to consider the solution of this equation for a stationary state in the momentum representation. Sim ilarly, in Pblm . 4.6 we solved for the momentum amplitude and density for the infinite square well . 31Dirac wrote what many consider to be the most elegant, clear presentation of this theory . in his landmark book Principles o!Quantum Mechanics (Oxford: Clarendon Press , 1958), now in its fourth edit ion (and in paperback!). 580 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions Now I want to generalize this result by proving that Proclamation 12.1 All probabilistic and statistical quantities that refer to a constant of the motion of a system are independent of time. In light of (12.124), this claim certainly looks reasonable. The probability for obtaining a (discrete) eigenvalue q,. in a measurement of Q is d,Q)(t).32 These quantities appear in the expression for (Q), (Q) (t) = L Ic~Q)(t)12 qn ' n (12.125) (For simplicity, I've assumed that the spectrum of Q is purely discrete. Proclama- tion 12.1 and its proof generalize easily to constants of the motion with continuous and mixed spectra.) It is unlikely indeed that (Q) would be independent of time unless each probability Ic~Q)(tW were also independent of time. [If correct, this conclusion does not, of course, mean that c~Q)(t) is itself independent of time.] But this plausibility argument doesn't constitute a proof. Suppose, however, that we can prove that all individual probabilities are indepen- dent of time, d d 0' -P(q t) = -lc(Q)(t)1 2 == 0dt ,., dt\" all n. (12.126) Then we can conclude that all expectation values (J(Q)) are also independent of time, and therefore that the uncertainty, which depends only on (Q) and (Q2), is time independent. So let's focus our attention on Eq. (12.126). Argument: The obvious way to proceed, I suppose, is to try to derive an equation for the time dependence of c~Q)(t)-an equation analogous to (12.88) for the energy amplitudes c~E)(t)-inthe hopes that when we multiply c~Q)(t)by its complex conjugate in (12.126), the time dependence will just go away . At first, this road seems to lead to a dead end. 33 To explore the problem, we start with the expansion of w(x, t) in the complete set {X~Q)(x)} of eigenfunctions of Q. n Substituting this expansion into the TDSE for W(x, t), Eq. (12.79), we get '\"' c(Q)(t) -u X(Q) = iii '\"' X(Q) !ic(Q)(t) L...J n' II. n' L....J n' dt n' , n' 1l' (12.127) (12.128) 321n this section we'll use projections of a state on eigenfunctions of if. and on eigenfunctions of Q. To keep straight these two types of projections. I'll use a superscript to indicate the observable in which the wave function was expanded. 33We shall follow here very closely the derivation of (12.88). The present derivation will be much easier to follow if you'll take a minute to refresh your memory about the earlier one. Sec. 12.9 Final Thoughts: Constants of the Motion Reconsidered 581 which is very similar to Eq. (12.840). But we cannot now proceed with the rest of this der;yation as we did in getting to Eq. (12.88),for the functions x~J)are not eigenfunctions ofH. We must leave it where it sits in (12.128). Its lurking presence means, as we shall see, that the equation for the nth projection c~Q)(t) is not independent of the other projections. To derive this equation, we invoke orthogonality of the eigenfunctions {X~Q)} of the Hermitian operator Q, (12.129) Multiplying Eq. (12.128) from the left by X~Q)*(x) and integrating the result over all space, we obtain an equation for each c~Q)(t): (12.130) These equations look a bit like (l2 .86b), with one crucial difference. The equations (12.130) for the various c~Q)(t) are coupled to one another . [Notice that I used orthonor- mality of the eigenfunctions of the (Hermitian) operator Qto eliminate the sum over n' on the right-hand side. The trouble is, we can't pull the same trick on the left-hand side to make Eq. (12.129) look like (12.86c).] To solve the equation for, say, c~Q)(t), you must know all the other projections c~Q)(t),n 1= 1, because they appear on the left-hand side. But to solve the equation for, say, c~Q)(t), you must know c~Q)(t), for it appears on the left-hand side of that equation. The dead end I mentioned above looks like a cul-de-sac. Oh well. You can't win 'em all. But wait! We have not used all we know about Q. SO far we've been treating this little guy like an arbitrary operator; but Qis not arbitrary at all. The operator Qrepresents a constant of the motion and therefore commutes with it. To see the consequences of this fact, let's clarify the structure of (12.130) by introducing Dirac notation for the integral: L>~9)(t)(x~Q)Iitl x~9Â» = in:tc~Q)(t). n' (12.131) Now, look very carefully at the matrix element in (12.131). It is the matrix el- ement of an operator (it) with respect to eigenfunctions of a second operator (Q) that commutes with the first . Do you recall the handy theorem we proved in Â§ 11.3? Accord- ing to Proclamation 11.3, such a matrix element is zero if the eigenvalues of the two eigenfunctions are different, i.e., [it,Q] = 0 (12.132) So things aren't as bad as they seemed: only one of the matrix elements on the left-hand side of the equation for each c~Q)(t) is non-zero. The sum goes away.

I 1 concerning constants of the motion reveal that in quantum physics, as in classical mechanics, there is about these observables a kind of stasis. But their constancy takes on a special form in quantum physics, a form dictated by the special, restricted nature of accessible knowledge about a microscopic system. EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS Unearned knowledge is perilous. Only by the seeking and gaining of it may its uses be understood, its true worth measured. -Pitchwife in White Gold Wielder by Stephen Donaldson The problems for this chapter focus primarily on its contents. But because this chapter is, secondarily, a \"wrap up\" of the whole book, 1 have included some exercises that draw on earlier material. Exercises 12.1 States of the Simple Harmonic Oscillator-8tationary and Otherwise All questions in this exercise concern a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator with natural frequency woo Those of Part A pertain to the basic quantum physics of a one- dimensional conservative system, those of Part B to the physical properties of the oscillator, those of Part C to its stationary and non-stationary states, and those of Part D to measurements. Part A: [a] Write down the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for this system, including the explicit expression for the Hamiltonian. [b] Using the mathematical technique of separation of variables, derive an expression for the wave function lJ1(x, t) of a stationary state of the SHO, showing explicitly the time- dependence of this function. Also derive the equation for the Hamiltonian eigenfunction 'l/Jn(X} . (Do not, however, solve the TISE.) [cJ Prove that the Hamiltonian you wrote down in part [a] is Hermitian. (You do not have to go back to first principles to do this; i.e., you can use the fact that x and jJ are Hermitian. But justify each step in your argument.) Exercises and Problems 583 [d] From the Henniticity of the Hamiltonian, there follow several important quantum- mechanical properties. For each of the following items, state the appropriate property: (I) the expectation value of the energy, (E) ; (2) the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, En : (3) the set of Hamiltonian eigenfunctions, {'l/Jn(X}}; (4) the \"overlap integral\" of two Hamiltonian eigenfunctions, ('l/Jn(X) I tPm(XÂ»), where n =I m. Part B: [a] For each pair of observables listed below, answer each of the following questions: (I) are the observables compatible? (2) is it possible in principle to measure the two observables simultaneously to infinite precision? (3) does there exist a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of the operators that represent these observables? (4) is the product of the uncertainties of the two observables in each pair, when evaluated for an arbitrarystate, necessarily positive? 1. energy and parity; 2. energy and position; 3. parity and momentum; 4. position and momentum [bj From this list, pick one pair that does have a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions and write down the fonn of these eigenfunctions. [cj Is the parity of this system conserved? Why or why not? Part C: In this part we shall consider two states of the SHOoThe initial conditions that define these states are represented by the following (normalized) wave functions: 1 111(x, 0) = J7;; [2'I/Jo(x) + 3tPI (xÂ»), v13 where tPn(X) are Hamiltonian eigenfunctions of the SHO, and (12.1.1) (12.1.2) For each of these states, answer each of the following questions: [aj Is either of these states stationary? If so, which one(s)? [bj Write down the wave functions lII(x, t) and III'(x, t) that represent the states at times t > 0 that evolve from these initial states. [cj At t = 0 the parity of each state is measured. What value (or values) will be obtained in the measurements, and with what probabilities? Is the parity of either state sharp? Why or why not? [dj Evaluate the expectation value of the parity of each state. What is the physical signifi- cance of these quantities? [ej Now, suppose that at t = 0 we measure the energy of each of these states instead of the parity. Evaluate the probability that a member of the ensemble will exhibit each of the following values. Do this for the state represented by lII(x, t) and for the state represented by III'(x, t) . In each case, fully justify your answer to each question. 584 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions 1.

Prove your answer. [b] At time t = 10 sec we measure the momentum of the particle . Write down an expression for the probability that we will obtain in this measurement a value between liko and liko + dk. (You do not have to fully evaluate your expression, but write it completely enough that the only thing left to do is to evaluate an integral.) [c] How would your answer to question [b] differ if the momentum measurement were carried out at t = 40 sec instead of at t = lOsec? Justify your answer. 12.2 The Physics of a Non-Stationary State Consider a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator with natural frequency Wo that is initially in a quantum state represented by the unnorma/ized wave function 'l1(x,O) = [2'I/J()(x) + 4'I/Jl (x) - 3'I/J3(X)] , (12.2.1) (12.1.1) where, of course , the functions 'l/Jn(X)'S are the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions for this system.

[h] Do simultaneous eigenstates of parity and energy exist for this system ? If so, tell why and give an example. If not, tell why not. Problems 12.1 Energy Measurements on a Non-Stationary State Suppose a particle in the well of Fig. 12.4 is in a state represented by the function 'l1(x,t) = ~ [4'I/Jl (x)e-iElt/h + 'l/J2(x)e-iE2t/h y30 _2i'I/J3(x)e-iEat/h + 3'I/J4(x)e-iE4t/h] . In an energy measurement at time t, what value is most likely to be obtained? . . . least likely to be obtained? What are the probabilities of a member system exhibiting each of these values? To describe the aggregate of results of the measurement, evaluate the expectation value and the uncertainty at time t. Exercises and Problems 585 12.2 Average Values for Non-Stationary States Suppose we have in hand the energy probability amplitudes cn(O) for a state lit of a one- dimensional quantum system. Suppose the energy spectrum of the system is discrete, with eigenvalues En, n = 1,2, .. . and eigenfunctions tPn(X). A measurement at time t > 0 is performed on an observable Q (not the energy). Derive the following expression for the mean value of Q obtained in this state: ( \"\" .

Before expansion, the microscopic particle in the well was contentedly minding its own business in the ground stationary state, with energy E~L}. At t = 10 sec, the particle's energy is measured. [a] What is the mostprobable value obtained in the measurement? Calculate the probability of a member system exhibiting this value. [b] What is the probability that a member will exhibit the value 1r 21i 2 j(2mL2 )? Discuss briefly the implications of your answer for the state of the system after expansion.

[d] What is the ensemble average obtained in the measurement? tel How does p(Ej2L}) depend on j in the limit j ---> oo? What does your answer imply about the energy uncertainty for this state? 12.4 Son of the Amazing Expanding Square Well Consider again the expanding square well of Pblm. 12.3. Suppose the initial state of the particle beforeexpansion is a non-stationary state of the well of width L, i.e., lIt(x,O) = ~ [3tP~L)(x)+ tP~L)(x)]. [a] Let's first analyze the state at t = 0 before expansion. (I) Were we to measure the energy of this state, what values would we find, and with what probabilities? (2) In such a measurement, what value would we get for the average energy? (3) What value would we get for the energy uncertainty? [b] Now the well expands, its width changing from L to 2L. At t > 0 we measure the energy of the particle in the expanded well. (I) Thought Question: Is the wave function at t > 0 lIt(x,t) J: ~ [3tP~L}(x)e-iE~L)t/1i +tP~L)(x)e-iEiL)t/Ii]? If so, tell why and go to part [b (2)]. If not, is the wave function lIt(x,t) J: ~ [3tP~2L)(x)e- iE\\2L)t/1i +tP~2L}(x)e-iEi2L)t/Ii]? (l2.4.2b) If so, explain why. If not, tell why not. (2) In the measurement at t = 10 sec, what values of the energy are allowed? Derive an expression for their probabilities. (3) Of the first ten eigenvalues Ej2L}, what values are allowed but do not appear in the measurement for this state? Why do these values not appear? (4) What is the most probable value for this state? What is its probability? (5) Calculate the mean value of the results obtained in the energy measurement. 586 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions (6) Calculate the energy uncertainty for this state. Hint: The uncertainty for this state is not infinite. To help you find out what it is, here's a handy series you may not know about: ~ 1 11\" (11\"Y) L (2j + 1)x2 _ y2 = 4xy tan \"2; . J=O (12.4.3) [cl What property of the non-stationary state (12.4.1) causes the uncertainty AE after ex- pansion of the well to be finite? Would a finite uncertainty follow for any non-stationary state? Why, or why not? 12.5 The Incredible Sloshing Oscillator-Explained! In Â§ 9.10 we investigated the behavior of a non-stationary state of a particle in a simple harmonic oscillator potential V(x) = TnW5x2/2, i.e., a wave packet [see Example 9.61. We found that such a packet exhibits periodic behavior, sloshing back and forth, as illustrated in Fig. 9.20. In the discussion of Example 9.6, I remarked on the eigenfunction expansion of a non-stationary state wave function [Eq, (9.137)], and now I want to illuminate that discussion with what we have leamed in this chapter. Consider, then, an arbitrary wave packet llJ(x, t) of a SHO with natural-frequency woo [a] Write down the expansion of this function in eigenfunctions of the SHO Hamiltonian. Show in your expansion the explicit time dependence of the projections cn(t) . [bl The classical period of such an oscillator is T = 211\"/wo. Based on the expansion of part [aI, figure out the wave function at this time, llJ(x, T). How is this function related to llJ(x,O)? How are the position probability densities at the two times related? [cl Discuss the relationship of the properties of all observables in this state at t = T- energy, position, momentum, etc.-to these observables in the state at t = O. Discuss how the probabilistic and statistical properties of all observables vary with time. [d] The classical limit of the simple harmonic oscillator is n -+ 00, the limit in which the spacing between adjacent (quantized) energies becomes very small compared to the values of those energies (Â§ 9.8). Use the Correspondence Principle to explain how your answers to part [cl go over in this limit smoothly to the classical description of the time-dependence of observables for a macroscopic oscillator, such as a pendulum. 12.6 Inducing Non-Stationary State Behavior In the extended example of Â§ 12.6 we saw one way to coerce a system into a non-stationary state: make a sudden change in some parameter of the system, thereby changing its potential. In that example, we altered the size of an infinite square well that enclosed a microscopic particle. Here we'll consider an alternate way to create a non-stationary state, working with our other omnipresent example: the simple harmonic oscillator. Suppose the potential energy of the oscillator is 1 2 2 V(x) = 2TnWO(x - xo) . (12.6.1) This potential differs from that of a conventional oscillator (Chap. 9) in that its midpoint is at Xo rather than at x = O. Suppose further that the initial state of the particle with this potential is the ground stationary state, with energy E = T'uuo/ 2. Now, imagine that a sudden change in the system is effected at t = 0 so that the center of the oscillator is shifted from Xo to x = O. We shall suppose the change to be so sudden that, to a good approximation, we can consider it, instantaneous. The Hamiltonian of the system after the change is the familiar one â€¢ â€¢ 1 2 2 1i = T + 2TnWoX . (12.6.2) Exercises and Problems 587 (12.7.1) Let's explore the consequences of this sudden change on the state of the system. [a) Write down an explicit expression for the initial wave function before the change. [b] Suppose we measure the energy at some t > o. Determine the probability that we will obtain each of the following values: (I) 4/iwo; (2) ~/iwo; (3) a value greater than ~/iwo. [c] Write down the wave function lJt(x, t) for t > o. (You need not evaluate the general expansion coefficient in your expression, but explain how you would do so if you had to.) 12.7 InSearch of State Functions As noted in Â§ 12.6. in applying quantum mechanics we must often construct the wave function that represents a quantum state from bits and pieces of information gleaned from various experiments. Usually it is not possible to infer from experimental data all the details of the state function , but, given sufficient experimental data, we can often determine enough about the function to use it in predictive calculations. We considered an instance of this in Example 12.6. Here is another. Consider a particle of mass m in an infinite square well with \" walls\" at x = -L/2 and x = L/2. In our first of two experiments, we perform an ensemble measurement at some time t of the energy of the particle. We find that the members of the ensemble exhibit only the values E 1 and E 2 , and that the average value of energy is 37T 21i2 (E) (t) = 2mÂ£2 ' [a] Write down an explicit expression for the most general wave function lJt(x, t) that is consistent with this information. (Be careful in how you deal with the phase of each term in your function.) [b] In our second experiment, we measure the position of the same particle, ensuring that it is in the same state as before we measured the energy. In the pos ition measurement, we learn that at t = 0 the particle is more likely to be found in the right half of the box (i.e., at some value of x between 0 and L/2) than in the left half. Use this additional information to refine your wave funct ion from part [a], i.e., come up with a wave function that is consistent with the results of both the energy and the pos ition measurements. Is your wave function now completely specified, or do you need more experimental data to fully determine it? Remark: The curious caveat in the first sentence of part [b] is necessary because the energy measurement will change the state of the system, and I don't want you to worry about this effect yet. Were we actually going to measure two observables, such as position and energy, in the laboratory we could proceed as follows : Sub-divide the initial ensemble into two identical sub-ensembles and perform the energy measurement on one sub-ensemble and the position measurement on the other. This ensures that the energy measurement will not alter the position characteristics of the state and vice versa. We'll look at the remarkable effects of measurement on a quantum state in Chap. 13. 12.8 A Tricky Question Derive the momentum uncertainty (t::.P)n for an arbitrary stat ionary state of a particle of mass m in an infinite square well of width L. 588 Chap. 12 Eigenfunction Expansions CHAPTER 13 Altered States The Great Measurement Mystery 13.1 The Role of Measurement in Quantum Physics 13.2 The Effect of a Measurement on a State Function 13.3 The Evolution of a State After Collapse * 13.4 Multiple Measurements of Compatible Observables I * 13.5 Multiple Measurements 1/: An Example * 13.6 Dueling Observables : Multiple Measurements of Incompatible Observables 13.7 Final Thoughts: Mysteries Abound \"Careful, Dorothy,\" he cautioned her. \"Nothing that actually happens is or can be preposterous.\" -from Sky/ark of Va/eron by E. E. \"Doc\" Smith We now confront a major mystery : what happens to the state ofa system when we measure an observable? So far, we have avoided this question, learning instead how to describe the evolution of a quantum state in isolation, i.e., in the absence of measurement. We know how to follow the development of a state from its initial condition to the time of a measurement and how to predict the probabilities for the various results that might be obtained in the measurement. But until now we haven't faced the question: what is the state of the system after the measurement? The answer, although strictly part of the formalism of quantum mechanics , is not to be found in the Schrodinger equation . As we shall see (Â§ 13.2), a measurement of an observable causes the state to change in a way that is inherently uncontrollable and unpredictable . via a mechanism the nature of which we do not know. That such a change takes place is not at issue; as the distinguished mathematician John von Neumann (1903- 1957) showed in 1932, this phenomenon is built into quantum theory.' What is at issue is why and how the state function changes . This conundrum is called the problem of measurement. In a recent review of this problem.P John G. Cramer remarked that the problem of measurement \"remains the most puzzling and counterintuitive aspect of the interpretation of quantum mechanics .\" Why, in an introduction to quantum mechanics, should we worry about the problem of measurement? For one thing, physics is the science of measurement. Our understand- ing of the physical universe in its macroscopic and microscopic realms ultimately rests on experiments, on measurements. Indeed, physicists believe in quantum theory because it continues to be verified in a huge number of experiments on a variety of systems under a range of physical conditions. But to understand the behavior of the microworld, as manifested in these experiments, we must understand the effect on an ensemble of human observation. This effect is the subject of this chapter. Were we studying classical physics, we could ignore the experimental dimension of our subject (although it would be unwise to do so), because in principle, an experiment on a macroscopic system does not alter its state; i.e., a measurement can leave unchanged all physical properties of a classical system . But that's not true for a microscopic system . Moreover, investigating a system whose states are represented by wave functions is quite different from studying one whose states are described by trajectories. The reason for this difference is that, unlike a trajectory, a state function has no real physical existence. Rather, this function is the mathematical embodiment of accessible knowledge about the state it represents . Only in the laboratory can we seek such information about the wave function as nature allows . (In Example 12.6, for instance, we used data from an energy measurement to deduce information about the state function of an ensemble of CO molecules.) But when we perform measurements, 1Von Neumann's trail-blazing work Mathematical Foundations a/QuantumMechanics (Princeton. N. J.: Princeton University Press, 1955) does not make for easy reading. but I nonetheless recommend its early chapters to readers who are determined to understand in depth the problem of measurement. 2Rev. Mod. Phys., 58, 647 (\\986). 590 Chap. 13 Altered States the state function changes as a consequence.i' So to plan and execute experiments and to apprehend their results , we must understand their effect on the state of the system on which they are performed. If two or more observables are measured, the problem of measurement becomes a problem of \"knowability\" (Â§ 13.3). If the observables are incompatible, then their uncertainties satisfy an inequality-the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (Â§ 11.4)-that may prohibit our knowing their precise, simultaneous values. We shall examine the measurement of two incompatible observables in Â§ 13.4 and, as a happy by-product of our inquiry into the effects of measurement on a state, will gain insight into how uncertainty works, a rare glimpse into the innermost secrets of the microcosm. 13.1 THE ROLE OF MEASUREMENT IN QUANTUM PHYSICS When you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge of it is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind. -Lord Kelvin (1824-1907) Anyone who has worked in a laboratory knows the pragmatic definition of a measure- ment: a measurement is the experimental determination of information about the physical properties of a system. In this chapter I want to focus on the conceptual definition of a measurement, and to this end will consider only \"idealized measurements\"-idealized in a sense that will become clear as we proceed . Our first step towards idealizing the process of measurement is to assume that a measurement can be performed instantaneously.\" Accordingly, we will speak of a \"measurement time.\" I'll denote the measurement time for an unspecified observable (or observables) by t-Â« and for a specific observable Q by tQ . Limitations on Measurement Both nature and human fallibility limit the accuracy of experiments. The latter source of uncertainty is the most familiar. Experimental error and the inadequacies of man-made apparatus limit the precision of measured data. For example, in the energy-loss spectrum for electron-Fj scattering in Fig. 12.3a each peak has a width which results from the inability of the source and detector to determine precisely the energy of a microscopic particle . Similar experimental uncerta inties plague physicists , regardless of the size of the systems they study. More insidious (though less a problem in practice) are quantum uncerta inties, which arise from the intrinsic \"unknowability\" of precise information about microscopic sys- tems, as codified in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle of Chap. 11. Uncertainty may arise in a measurement of a single observable if the state being investigated happens not 3Like other statements in these introductory remarks. this is true in general. If. however. the state before measurement happens to be an eigenstate of the observable being measured, then the state function is unchanged by the measurement. (See Â§ 13.2.) 4Like practically every aspect of measurement theory, defining the time at which an experiment is performed is a subtle business. For a provocative discussion of this question see \"When is a Quantum Measurement\" by Asher Peres. Amer . Jour . Phys.â€¢ 54, 688 (1986). Sec. 13.1 The Role of Measurement in Quantum Physics 591 to be an eigenstate of that observable.P Or it may arise (in a more complicated way) in attempts to measure simultaneously two (or more) observables. We know from Â§ 11.4 that if observables Q and R are incompatible, then for any state their uncertainties obey the inequality [the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (11.55)] (13.1) Whether or not this principle actually limits the \"knowability\" of precise information about Q and R depends on the state-more precisely, on whether the expectation value on the right-hand side of (13.1) is zero tc f., Table 11.4). If not, then we cannot simul- taneously measure Q and R to infinite precision. In the introduction to this chapter, I noted the role of measurement as an exploratory tool for probing the nature of a state function, which is itself inaccessible. Measurement also plays a part in the predictive function of physics. A primary objective of an ex- periment is to determine sufficient information about the state of a system at one time to enable prediction of the system's subsequent behavior. That is, we'd like to measure enough observables at t m to be able to predict the evolution of the system for t > tm' But in quantum mechanics, such predictions are impossible unless we know what the measurement does to the state function. For, unlike classical physicists, quantum physicists must live with the unavoidable observer-observed interaction I first men- tioned in Chap. 1: 6 Rule It is impossible to perform a measurement on a microscopic system that does not disturb the system in a significant, unpredictable. and uncontrollable way. Concerning this remarkable feature of quantum mechanics, John Von Neumann said:7 . .. in the atom we are at the boundary of the physical world, where each measurement is an interference of the same order of magnitude as the object measured and therefore affects it basically. Now there's a sobering thought. The Meaning of \"Measurement\" (A Review) In Chap. 3 (Â§ 3.4) we thoroughly examined the conceptual definition of a measurement on a microscopic system. This topic is so crucial to our present concerns that I want to take a moment to review it. Central to the interpretation of quantum mechanics is 5Recall (Chap. 10) that a system in an eigenstate of Q has a value of this observable-namely. the eigenvalue obtained when Q acts on the state function, as Q'It(x, t) = q'lt(x , t). So for such a state t:.Q = 0, and the only limits to precision are experimental uncertainties. 6 Among other disquieting implications, this rule prohibits us from inferring from measurements at t m the nature of the state for t < t m . In general, the most we can hope to determine uniquely is the state at the instant before we made the measurement. See Â§ 7.1 of Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by R. H. Dicke and D. Wittke (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley . 1960). 7Quoted in The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics by M. Jammer (New York: Wiley. 1974). p. 266. This fascinating volume contains lengthy historical and philosophical discussions concerning the problem of measurement. 592 Chap. 13 Altered States the concept of an ensemble of microscopic systems. Recall (Fig. 3.5) that an ensemble is a collection of a huge number of identical. non-interacting systems in the same quan- tum state. Individual systems in the ensemble are called members. And according to Postulate I, any state of the ensemble can be represented by a state function 111.8 When we speak of \"a measurement at tQ of Q\" we mean simultaneous measure- ments of the observable Q on all members of the ensemble.? I will use the symbol MQ[tQ] as shorthand for such a measurement. And Then a Miracle Occurs It is surprisingly easy to see that an experiment must change the state of the system. Imagine a measurement of an observable Q. Suppose the experimental set-up is such that the state before measurement is not an eigenstate of Q-i.e., that the uncertainty AQ is positive. In terms of an ensemble, this condition means that at the instant before MQ[tQ] the members of the ensemble do not have a value ofQ ; rather, their state allows for several poss ible values of Q, anyone of which may appear in the measurement. These values, we now know, are among the eigenvalues of Q. Now, think about what happens to the ensemble when we measure Q: each member exhibits one or another of the eigenvalues of Q. After MQ[tQ]. each member has a value of Q-the value it exhibited in the measurement-and so is in an eigenstate of Q.10 SO after the measurement each member is in a state in which Q is sharp. But not all members are in the same state: some exhibited one value of Q in MQ[tQ], others exhibited a different value. Clearly, the measurement changed the nature ofthe ensemble- in fact, what was an ensemble is no longer an ensemble, for the various members are in different quantum states. The measurement changed the state! It is this marvel that we will now look at in detail. 13.2 THE EFFECT OF A MEASUREMENT ON A STATE FUNCTION I don 't know, we may be into some kind of quantum thing here, or some exotic relativistic physics, in which consciousness snapped me into some new sharp state. My physics is lousy. -Dr. Edward Jessup in Altered States (A Novel) by Paddy Chayefsky 8In this book we consider only ensembles that can be represented by a state function; such ensembles are said to be in pure states. Someday you may encounter a mixed state of an ensemble, a state in which the available information is insufficient to specify a state function. Such an ensemble must be described by more arcane mathematical beasts called density matrices. 9Some physicists prefer to think of a measurement as a huge number of successive measurements on a single system. This is OK provided one remembers that the state of the system prior to each measurement must be the same . I find this definition confusing and so won't use it in this book. lOWe are in treacherous semantic waters. Even the word \"after\" has to be carefully defined. By \"after\" I mean an infinitesimal time after-e-i.e., at tQ + bt, The reason for this qualification is that once the measurement is over, the members of the ensemble continue to evolve according to the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation. This subsequent time development may further change the state, in ways we have discussed in Chaps. 6 and 12. But at the moment we are not concerned with this evolution. (See Â§ 13.2) Sec. 13.2 The Effect of a Measurement on a State Function 593 At the end of the previous section, we deduced that measuring an observable Q on an ensemble changes the state of the members so that afterward, each is in an eigenstate of Q. Which eigenstate a member winds up in depends on which eigenvalue of Q it exhibited in the measurement. In fact, what is left after the measurement is not a single ensemble, but rather several sub-ensembles. Each sub-ensemble consists of all members ofthe original ensemble that exhibited the same eigenvalue ofQ in MQ[tQ]. So each sub- ensemble is a coUection of (identical, non-interacting) member systems each of which is in a particular eigenstate. That is, each sub-ensemble is itself an ensemble. Here is a handy summary of this argument: MEASUREMENT OF Q AT TIME tQ : Before Q is uncertain: AQ > 0 -+ ensemble is notin an eigenstate of Q After Q is sharp: AQ = 0 each sub-ensemble is in an eigenstate of Q (13.2) Clearly, the measurement wreaks a dramatic change on the ensemble on which it is performed. In this section and the next I want to illustrate the effects of measurement by reexamining a familiar experiment and a couple of familiar examples. Another Look at the Single-Silt Experiment In Chap . 2 we considered the determination of the position of electrons in the double-slit experiment (Â§ 2.5). In this classic demonstration, the electrons seem to behave like waves in their propagation through space and like particles in their conduct at the detector. The dual nature of sub-atomic particles is also evident in the single-slit experi- ment sketched in Fig. 13.1. The source emits a beam of (non-interacting, nearly mono- energetic) electrons; this beam is our ensemble. The electrons in the beam propagate through the apparatus until they reach the detector, where they form spots . Of course, we now know that the state of the electrons in the beam is represented by a wave function, the squared modulus of which is their position probability density . In this figure, I have sketched this density at various times during the journey from source to detector. The question I want to pose now is: what is the significance of the appearance of spots on the detector? That is, what do these events imply about the state of the electrons after measurement? To find out, let's consider the wave function as the electrons travel to the detector. Drawing on our knowledge of wave packets (Chaps. 4 and 6), we can explain the behavior of the electrons. They emerge from the source in a state represented by a free-particle wave packet-a state in which the position uncertainty Ax is positive. As time passes, this packet propagates, according to the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation with V = 0, to the diaphragm. Passage through the slit changes the state of the electrons, which emerge in a state represented by a different wave packet (see Fig. 13.1). But until they arrive at the detector. the electrons do not have a position (i .e., after traversing the slit, the position uncertainty Ax is still positive). This state is characterized by several possible positions, as is evident in the probability densities in Fig. 13.1. 594 Chap. 13 Altered States Detector Source PIx, I) Slit t x I I I I I I I +x o I I I I I_______ --1 PIx, I) L..L...Â¥..._..K-:!Io....-~PldlL x x x Figure 13.1 The single-slit diffraction experiment.

Note that the last probability density. which corresponds to the state that represents (the sub-ensemble of) electrons that exhibited a spot at Xo. is not a consequence of evolution 11 la the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation. At some time t x , an electron arrives at the detector, a phosphor that measures position. It is here that we see evidence of particle-like behavior, for on the detector. spots form .11 This means that at t x the state function changed, for at this time each electron suddenly \"acquired\" a definite position-the value Xo at which the spot appears (see Fig. 13.1). Evidently the measurement \"actualized\" one of the multitude of possible positions that were implicit in the wave function before measurement. That is, MAt\",] altered the state of the ensemble, transforming the wave function from one for which Ax > 0 to ones for which Ax = O. (Position is sharp only at the instant after measure- ment. Afterward, the states of the electrons evolve, according to the TDSE, into ones for which Ax is positive.) In this discussion we have identified the two radically different ways that a quantum state can change: 1. In the absence of measurement (no interaction with an observer), a state undergoes \"natural Schrodinger evolution,\" changing with time according to the TDSE. 2. When an observable is measured, the state undergoes an \"induced mutation,\" a change that is not described by the TDSE. II What we actually see in the laboratory are photons emitted when molecules in the phosphor decay out of the state into which they were excited by the electrons . As discussed in Chap. 2. the distribution of these photons and the physics of the interaction of the electron with the molecules of the phosphor are analogous to the classical behavior of particles. not waves. Sec. 13.2 The Effect of a Measurement on a State Function 595 Energy Measurements and Their Effects As I noted in Â§ 13.1, to understand these \"induced mutations,\" it is crucial that we fully understand the change in the ensemble to which the electrons belong . To clarify this aspect of measurement theory, let's return to an example from Â§ 12.4, one that concerns an energy measurement. Example 13.1. Converting a Non-Stationary State into a Stationary State In Example 12.5 we analyzed a non-stationary state of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well of width L. There we sought to predict the outcome of an energy measurement at t = 0 for a state that prior to the measurement was represented by the wave function (with x = 0 at the left wall) (30 w(x ,O) = VV x(x - L) . (13.3) (13.4) To this end, we \"translated\" this wave function into the energy representation, obtaining the energy probability amplitudes'? { O n = 2,4, 6, . . . C~E)(0) = 1 8V15 . -3\"--3- n=l ,3,5, ... n 71' The square modulus of c~E)(0) is the probability that a member of an ensemble of systems in this state will exhibit the eigenvalue En = n 27l'2\",? j(2mL 2 ) in the measurement. We evaluated some of these probabilities in Eq. (12.48)-finding for example that P(EI) = 0.9986 and P(E3 ) = 0.0014. To understand the implications of these findings, consider an ensemble of 10,000 particle-in-a-box systems initially in the state (13.3). In an average measurement, 9986 of the members would yield the ground-state energy El, while 14 would yield the energy of the second excited state, E3 â€¢ [We might obtain one of the higher excited-state energies, because any member could exhibit any En (for odd n). But P(En) for n > 3 is so small that a larger ensemble would be required for even one member to have a fighting chance of showing one of these values.] But the measurement also \"forces\" each member into the energy eigenstate corre- sponding to the value it exhibited. So the number Icn (0)1 2 is also the probability that immediately after MEltE = 0) the system will be in the nth stationary state. We could verify this prediction by measuring the energy a second time, as in Fig. 13.2. Suppose that in this additional experiment, we measure the energy of the sub-ensemble of systems that exhibited E I in the first energy measurement . This sub-ensemble is in an energy eigenstate, so in the second measurement all its member systems would exhibit the value E I â€¢ It's easy to write down the wave function that represents the state of each sub- ensemble immediately after the first energy measurement . This measurement altered the wave function of those member systems that exhibited E 1 from w(x,O) of Eq. (13.3) to that of the ground stationary state: WI (x, 0) = wI(x). Similarly, it changed the wave function of those systems that exhibited E3 from w(x,O) to W3(X ,0) = W3(X). The nature of the change of state in this example is clear: the initial wave function w(x ,O) represented a state with an uncertain energy, i.e., one in which the particle has no energy. The (first) energy measurement \"actualized\" one of the possible energies inherent in this wave function, thereby transforming the non-stationary state into one of two stationary states. 121n this chapter 1 will label projections of a state function with its expansion observable whenever doing so might avoid confus ion. 596 Chap. 13 Altered States tJ.E>O tJ.E=O (E, sub-ensemble) MEltE >01 on E, sub-ensemble only Figure 13.2 Two energy measurements on an ensemble of infinite square wells whose particles are in the state (13.3) prior to the first measurement. After the first measurement. we select those systems that gave E 1 and re-measure the energy of this sub-ensemble . These systems exhibit only the value E}, for they are in a state in which the energy is sharp. One important use of such measurements is to \"prepare\" a system in a particular stationary state-say. for subsequent measurements of other properties. To prepare a system in this way. simply take an ensemble of systems. measure the energy. and create a sub- ensemble consisting of all members that exhibited the energy you want. Such preparations yield the initial conditions we have seen in previous examples in this book. Question 13-1 Suppose the second energy measurement on the E 1 sub-ensemble were carried out at. say. t = lOsee . Would the results differ from those obtained in a seeond energy measurement immediately after the first measurement? Why or why not? Collapse of the State Function Physicists have a quaint name for the remarkable transformation of a wave function that occurs when a measurement is performed: the collapse of the state function (also known as reduction of the wave packet). This name is supposed to conjure up an image of the measurement causing the state function to \"collapse\" onto one of the eigenfunctions of the corresponding operator. A convenient way to represent collapse of the wave function is via a \"branch diagram\" like the one in Fig. 13.3. 1/1, (xl e - iE,tltt Figure 13.3 A branch diagram for collapse of the state function. here illustrated for an energy measurement on an ensemble of infinite square wells initially in the state (13.3). Each arrow to the right of the box that represents the measurement MEltEI corresponds to one of the possibilities implicit in the state function prior to measurement . Each arrow is therefore labelled with one of the eigenvalues and with the projection of 111(x. 0). the squared modulus of which is the probability that the measurement will cause the state of the system to \"collapse\" into this possible eigenstate. Sec. 13.2 The Effect of a Measurement on a State Function 597 13.3 THE EVOLUnON OF A STATE AFTER COLLAPSE What happens after the collapse of a state function into an eigenstate? Well, if no further measurements are made, \"natural Schrodinger evolution\" takes over, and the state evolves according to the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation . In general, this development may be quite complicated and should be tackled using the machinery of Chap. 12. But if the observable measured was energy, the subsequent evolution of the state is simple, because the resulting state is an energy eigenstate . The time development of the wave function for an energy eigenstate was the subject of Chap. 7. To clarify the evolution of an eigenstate after collapse, we might think about the energy measurement as having \"re-initialized\" the state of each member in the ensemble. For example, the members of an ensemble that exhibit the eigenvalue E 1 in an energy measurement at t E = 0 (as in Example 13.2) have, immediately after the measurement, the new initial wave function So at subsequent times their wave function is simply 'It(x, t) = \"pI (x)e-iElt/fl t> t e = O. (13 .5) (13.6) (l3.7a) Be careful. If the measured observable is not energy, then the wave function after mea- surement does not necessarily have the simple time dependence (13.6). After perusing another example, we'll reckon with measurements of arbitrary observables. Example 13.2. Molecular Measurements In Example 12.6 we deduced the state function of an ensemble of CO molecules from data obtained in an energy measurement at t = O. In the measurement, 30% of the molecules exhibited the ground-state energy Eo. and 70% exhibited the first excited state energy E 1 â€¢ From these facts, we reasoned that the initial wave function was a linear combination of the first two stationary states, as in Eq. (12.56). In that example. we chose (for simplicity) to model the vibrating CO molecule by a simple harmonic oscillator. So we wrote the initial wave function in terms of the eigenfunctions 1/Jn(x) of the SHO Hamiltonian, as 'It(x ,O) = .fJoei 601/Jo(x) + IJoe'611/Jl (x). Equation (l3 .7a) represents the state of the molecules before the measurement, when their energy was not sharp. But after this measurement, the energy is sharp. So the mea- surement transformed the original ensemble into two distinct sub-ensembles , one consisting of particles with (sharp) energy Eo, the other of particles with (sharp) energy E 1 â€¢ Correspondingly. the wave functions that represent the state of the molecules in each sub-ensemble after the energymeasurement are one of two stationary-state wave functions, i.e., 'Ito(x, t) = 1/Jo(x) e - iEol/r, ,T, ( t) .1. ( ) - i E I I / h 'Â¥ 1 X, = '1\"1 X e . (l3 .7b) (13.7c) We're familiar (from Chap. 9) with the detailed nature of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions and energies in these functions. Question 13-2 Describe the results of a second energy measurement on each sub-ensemble. 598 Chap. 13 Altered States Measurement of Observables Other Than Energy We can easily extend the reasoning of this section to measurements of an arbitrary observable. The (partial) branch diagram in Fig. 13.4 shows what happens if we measure an observable Q represented by operator Q with eigenvalue equation Qx~Q) = qnX~Q). Here's the rule:13 Rule A measurement of Q will collapse the state into one of the eigenstates of Q. A member that exhib its the (non-degenerate) eigenvalue qn in MQ[tQ] will, immediately after the measurement, be in a state represented by the corresponding eigenfunction x~Q}. The probability that a member will be in this eigenstate is the squared modulus of the projection cg'} (t) of IJ1 on X~~}. The evolution of the state after measurement of an arbitrary observable differs in one very important respect from that of the state that results from a measurement of the energy. The eigenfunction of Q into which W collapses due to MQ[tQ] represents the state only in the instant after the measurement. As time passes, the state will evolve according to the TDSE (unless additional measurements are perforrned-a complication we'll confront in the next section). Unlike the time development of the stationary state that results from an energy measurement, the evolution of this state, which is almost always non-stationary, could be very complicated. Question 13-3 Can you think of any observable (or class of observables) other than if. whose measurement yields sub-ensembles whose subsequent evolution is described by a simple separable wave function ? (Hint: See Â§ 11.5.) 'It(x. to + 6t) = x,(x) 'It(x. to + 6t) = x2 (x) Figure 13.4 A branch diagram for the collapse of the state function due to the measurement of an arbitrary observable Q. l:i As usual, )'11 consider only operators with discrete spectra. This rule, and others we shall deduce, applies with the usual modifications to operators whose spectra are continuous or mixed. Sec. 13.3 The Evolution of a State After Collapse 599 Let's review our two methods for obtaining the wave function for t > tQ. The direct way is to solve the TDSE A a 1i'iV(x, t) = inat'iV(x, t) (13.8) subject to the (new) initial condition 'iV(x, tQ) = X~Q)(x). The easier (indirect) way is to expand 'iV(x, t) in the complete set of Hamiltonian eigenfunctions, as n Once we have determined the projections C~E)(tQ) = (t/Jn 1'iV(tQ)' (13.9a) (13.9b) we can easily write down the wave function that evolves from this initial function as (13.9c) n Equation (13.9c) makes clear the point I noted above: in general the system will not re- main in the eigenstate of Q into which it was thrown by MQ[tQ). Its \"natural Schrodinger evolution\" causes the state to evolve into the one represented by this wave function-a state in which Q is not sharp. Question 13-4 Explain the funny-looking time dependence in the exponential in (13.9c). Question 13-5 Consider the special case that the observable measured is a constant of the motion, i.e., that [Q, 'HI = 0, and that its spectrum is purely discrete (and non-degenerate). Argue (or prove) that in this special case. the complicated time dependence of Eq. (l3.9c) reduces to the familiar form (13.10) [Hint: Recall (Â§ 12.9: Proclamation 12.1) that all probabilistic and statistical quantities that refer to a constant of the motion of a system are independent of time.] *13.4 MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS OF COMPATIBLE OBSERVABLES I Things then did not delay in turning curious .. . there were revelations in progress all around her. -The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon We have seen that a measurement causes an uncontrollable, unavoidable change in a quantum state. This change comes about because the measurement necessarily involves an interaction between the observer and the system. This interaction causes the state to 600 Chap. 13 Altered States \"collapse\" into an eigenstate of the measured observable, so that afterward, this observ- able is sharp. According to the Born Interpretation of the state function, the probability of collapse into a particular eigenstate is the squared modulus of the projection of the state function (before measurement) on the corresponding eigenfunction of the operator that represents the measured observable. This summary suggests an interesting question: what happens to the state if we measure two observables simultaneously? Each measurement can transform the state into an eigenstate of the measured observable; so we might guess that after both measurements the system would be in an eigenstate of both observables. But such an outcome may be impossible: if the observables are incompatible. then a simultaneous eigenstate is prohibited (Â§ 11.1).14 But if so, then what does the simultaneous measurement do to the state? In the next three sections we'll discover the answer. We begin, after a couple of important definitions and a quick review of compatibility, with a look at the simplest case: compatible observables. Then we take up the more arresting case of incompatible observables. And there we'll learn how uncertainty principles work. A Simultaneous Measurement Defined Our starting point is the eigenvalue equations for two observables, Q and R, Q AX ( Q ) = q X(Q) 1t 11. n RX~) = rmX~). (B.lla) (l3.llb) For the moment I want to leave unspecified the commutator of these operators; i.e., [Q, R] mayor may not be zero. My notation for the eigenvalues, qn and r m , assumes, as usual, that the spectra of Q and R are purely discrete. (For instance, the examples in this section deal with measurement of the parity and total energy of a simple harmonic oscillator; the spectra for this it and for IT are purely discrete.) I'll denote the simulta- neous eigenfunctions of two compatible observables Q and R by the obvious extension f hi . (QR)OtIS notation, Xn,m . Now a little review. In Chap. II we learned that if two observables are compat- ible (i.e., if [Q, R] = 0), then their operators define a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions. In this case the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (13.1) allows us (in principle) to measure both simultaneously to infinite precision. If, on the other hand, the observables are incompatible (i.e., if [Q, R] f. 0), then such a set does not exist, and the precision of a simultaneous measurement of Q and R may be constrained by their uncertainty relation. Now, by a simultaneous measurement of Q and R we mean simply two mea- surements MQ[tQ] and MR[tR] that are carried out one right after the other. That is, the time interval between the measurements, t R - tQ' is arbitrarily small.15 14To keep the discussion in this section as simple as possible, I want to exclude the possibility of a single simultaneous eigenstate of Q and R. Although rare, such exceptions do occur-for example. the zero-angular-momentum state of a particle in three dimensions , which I noted in Â§ 11.1. Such states merely muddy already opaque waters and are not directly relevant to our immediate concerns. 15Actually, the measurements we'll consider differ from real measurements in that they induce the least possible change in the state of the system. I'll tell you more about these \"ideal\" measurements later in this section. Sec. 13.4 Multiple Measurements of Compatible Observables I 601 Simultaneous Measurement on an Eigenstate Suppose the measured observables are compatible, i.e., that [Q,R] = O. In principle we can measure simultaneously and precisely the values of two compatible observables for any state. But the particular outcome of such a measurement depends on whether or not the state is a simultaneous eigenstate of Q and R. For example, suppose that prior to either measurement the ensemble is the simul- taneous eigenstate \\l1 = xt~~). Then MQ[tQ] and MR[tR] leave the state unchanged . To understand why, look at the measurement diagram for this case, Fig. 13.5. In the initial state Q is sharp, with value qn' So in the first measurement, MQ[tQJ, all members exhibit the same value of Q, the eigenvalue qn' This measurement need not collapse the state into an eigenstate of Q. In fact, it need not change the state function at all. The same reasoning applies to the second measurement, MR[tR]. In the state before (and after) MQ[tQ], R is sharp, with value T m . So in MR[tR], each member exhibits the same value, T m , and this measurement, too, need not change the state. After all is said and done, the state function is the same as before either measurements, x~~:). To summarize our conclusions : Rule A simultaneous measurement of two compatible observables on an eigenstate of both ob- servables does not change the state of the system. Example 13.3. Parity and Energy Measurements on a Stationary State In the next several examples, we'll perform (in the laboratory of our imaginations) simul- taneous measurement of parity and energy on an ensemble of simple harmonic oscillators in various quantum states. We begin with the ground state-which is an eigenstate of both observables , with eigenvalues IT = +1 and E = Eo. The measurement diagram for this experiment appears in Fig. 13.6. Compare this diagram carefully to the general one in Fig. 13.5. t < to to < t < tR I â€¢ 10RI 1 B Member yields ~ BlJ Member yields 'I'(x, tl=Xn,m- Mo[toJ ---'-----;.~ Xn,m - R tR â€¢ ~ ~ Figure 13.5 A measurement diagram for simultaneous measurement of two compatible observables Q and R on a simultaneous eigenstate of these observ- abies. In the state prior to measurement. both observables are sharp, so the measurement does not change the state or the wave function, On Ideal Measurements You may be wondering: could the parity measurement Mn[tn] in Fig. 13.6 change properties related to the energy? This is a thoughtful question : the laws of quantum physics guarantee only that the parity measurement need not change the energy properties of the system. That is different from saying that the measurement does not change these properties. 602 Chap. 13 Altered States 8 Member yields Ilt(x, t)Â· !/IDe- iEat/h -- ......~ Mn [tnl â€¢ +1 til < t < tE t> tE I \"E tIL' 8 Member yields I -\"Eat/L' !/Ioe-' a 11_ ME[tEI ..~ !/IDe II Eo Figure 13.6 A measurement diagram for simultaneous measurement of the parity and energy of a simple harmonic oscillator in the ground (stationary) state. Because this state is a simultaneous eigenstate of both observables , nothing remarkable happens to the wave function. The measurement simply confirms the (sharp) values II = +1 (even parity) and Eo = nw/2. In this subtle issue lies a potential complication of the theory of measurement, for a real measurement of one of two compatible observables could change the value of the other observable. The change could be extensive; for example, if the other observable were sharp before measurement, it could be rendered uncertain after. So a real parity measurement might leave the system in any state with definite parity. For example, the state of a simple harmonic oscillator after a measurement Mn [tn) that yielded +1 could be any even-parity eigenstate: the wave function could be Wn for any even n or a linear combination of these even-n stationary states.!\" So a real measurement of the parity of the simple harmonic oscillator could change the energy of the system, even though energy and parity are compatible. But such an outcome is not possible in an ideal measurement. An ideal measurement is one that produces the minimum allowable disturbance in the physical properties of the system. This definition is a bit tricky, so read it again. Think about it a minute. An ideal measurement of an observable won't change properties related to any observable that is compatible with the measured one unless such a change is mandated by the laws ofquantum physics. 17 Thus, if we perform an ideal measurement of Q on an ensemble in a state in which an observable R (that is compatible with Q) is sharp, then after MQ[tQ), the observable R will still be sharp, its value unchanged by the measurement. Simultaneous (Ideal) Measurements on an Arbitrary State The effect of measuring compatible observables on a simultaneous eigenstate is none too thrilIing; nothing happens to the state. More interesting things happen when we measure two compatible observables on a system that is not in an eigenstate of one, the other, or both observables. To be specific, let's consider the \"worst case scenario\": a state in which before the measurement both Q and R are uncertain. In a simultaneous measurement on an ensemble initially in a state W with AQ > 0 and AR > 0, different members may exhibit different eigenvalues of Q and R. For either MQ[tQ) or MR[tR), we can calculate the probability that a member will exhibit a particular eigenvalue by squaring the modulus of the projection of W on the cor- responding eigenfunction immediately before the measurement. This much we know 160f course, an experiment in which the parity was found to be even could not throw the system into an odd-parity state, for that change would contradict the result of the measurement. 17 Such a measurement will, however, transform the state if quantum mechanics says it must. If, for ex- ample, the state prior to measurement is not an eigenstate of the measured observable, then the measurement- ideal or otherwise-must transform the state function into an eigenfunction of that observable. The distinction between an ideal and a real measurements will come more sharply into focus when we consider measurements of incompatible observables (Â§ 13.6).for a measurement of one such observable must change properties of the system related to the other observable. Sec. 13.4 Multiple Measurements of Compatible Observables I 603 from Chaps. 11 and 12. From the present chapter we know that each measurement will collapse the state into an eigenstate of the measured observable. The aforementioned probabilities tell us the likelihood of finding a member in one or another eigenstate after the measurement. To see this phenomenon in action, follow Fig. 13.7 as we analyze a successive measurement of compatible observables Q and R. Figure 13.7 A measurement diagram for simultaneous measurement of two compatible observables Q and R on a state that is initially not an eigenstate of either observable. Each measurement causes the state function to collapse into one of the eigenstates of the measured observable. The state after both measurements is a simultaneous eigenstate of both observables, a possibility allowed by the compatibility of Q and R. From Â§ 12.2 we know that to predict the outcome of the first measurement, MQ[tQ], we must discuss this measurement in \"the language of Q.\" To translate the state function into this language, we expand \\l1(x, t) in the complete set of eigenfunctions of Q: \\l1(x, tQ) = L c~)(t)x~Q)(x). n (13.12) The number Icg')(tW is the probability that the eigenvalue qn will be obtained in MQ[tQ]. A member that exhibits this value is thrown by the measurement into the n th eigenstate , so its eigenfunction immediately after MQ[tQ] is X~Q). Hence Ic~)(tW is also the probability of a member system winding up in this eigenstate after MQltQ]. Now tum to the second measurement, of the compatible observable R. We'll perform MR[tR] on the sub-ensemble of members that exhibited qn in MQ[tQ] (look carefully at Fig. 13.7). To predict the outcome of MR[tR], we translate the problem into \"the language of R\" by expanding the wave function after MQ[tQ], which we just said was X~Q), in the set of eigenfunctions of R:18 (13.13) m The probability of obtaining the eigenvalue T m in MR[tR] is just IC~;n)(tRW, which is also the probability that immediately after this measurement , the system wiII be in the m t h eigenstate of R. What is the ultimate effect of our simultaneous measurement? The first measure- ment collapsed each member of the original ensemble into an eigenstate of Q. The second further collapsed each member of each sub-ensemble into one of the eigenstates of R. So after both measurements, each member will be in one of the simultaneous eigenstates of both observables. We can prepare a state that is an eigenstate of several compatible observables by measuring one right after the other. (If, as is often the case, the observables are constants 18 11 may happen that X~Q) is an eigenfunction of R- .e.â€¢ MQ[tQ] could cause lit to collapse into one of the simultaneous eigenfunctions of Q and R (whose existe 'ce is guaranteed by the commutativity of Q and R).

(See Example 13.5.) 604 Chap. 13 Altered States ofthe motion, the simultaneity of their measurement is not important, because the system won't evolve out of an eigenstate of a constant of the motion while it waits for you to perform the next measurement.) For example, to prepare an ensemble of simple harmonic oscillators in a simultaneous eigenstate of parity and energy, you could first measure II and then E . Or, if more convenient, you could measure E first, then II. Example 13.4. Parity and Energy Measurements on a Non-Stationary State Return now to the ensemble of simple harmonic oscillators of Example 13.3 and suppose that their state prior to measurement of parity and energy is the following non-stationary initial condition : (13.14) This state is a superposition of one even-parity state (the ground state) and one odd-parity state (the first excited state). So for this state neither parity nor energy are sharp. We can analyze each measurement using the rules of Â§ 13.2, as shown in Fig. 13.8. 0< t < t n tn r > tn tE rÂ» tE 1/1 0 (x) e-iEor/ h G Member gives 1/1 0 (x) e-iEot/h I E â€¢ Eo ~ ;\\' Â«,,,,,e ~~ ,~o \\.p''It(x.t)- M.

Because this state is not an eigenstate of parity, the first measurement causes collapse into one of the parity eigenstates represented in the superposition. The resulting states are also energy eigenstates, so no further change of state occurs when energy is measured. The parity measurement causes each member to collapse into one of two parity eigenstates , with probabilities determined by the projections in Eq. (13.14): 1/5 of the systems wind up in the even-parity ground state, and 4/5 in the odd-parity first excited state. But each of the resulting states is also an energy eigenstate. So the second measurement, ME[tE] , need not (and, in an ideal measurement. does not) further alter the state. After all is said and done, the system is in a simultaneous eigenstate of parity and energy. Question 13--6 Equation (13.14) gives the wave function at the initial time t = O. Write down the form of the state function for times between t = 0 and tn. Sec. 13.4 Multiple Measurements of Compatible Observables I 605 Question 13-7 I don't have space here to discuss in detail the calculation of joint probabilities for measure- ments of multiple observables. However, to see how one puts such probabilities together, explain in detail why the probability of obtaining qn and T m in a simultaneous measurement of compatible observables Q and R on a system not in an eigenstate of either observable is (13.15) What would the joint probability be if X~) happened to be orthogonal to X~Q)? What would it be if the state prior to either measurement were an eigenstate of Q but not of R? . .. of R but not of Q? Analyzing the non-stationary state in Example 13.4 was particularly simple, be- cause this superposition included only one even-parity and one odd-parity term. As a consequence of this simplicity, the second measurement Me[tEl played no significant role in determining the final state. This situation is the exception, not the rule, as we'll see in the next section. *13.5 MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS 1/: AN EXAMPLE To show you how to cope with measurements on a more complicated state, I want to return to the ensemble of simple harmonic oscillators, this time considering the following initial condition.'P W(x,O) =.fÂ£[2~+3~-5~] . even odd even (13.16) In the absence of a measurement, this state would evolve according to the TDSE, as W(x, t) = ~ [2.,po(x) e- iEotln + 3.,p1 (x) e- iEItIn - 5.,p2(X) e-iE2tln] . (13.17) But suppose that at time tn = 0, we measure the parity of the system.P\" This state is clearly not an eigenstate of parity, for it contains one tenn whose parity is odd and two whose parities are even. So to determine the outcome and effect of Mn [tnl, we tum to the method of eigenfunction expansion . Fortunately, we don't have to explicitly translate the function in (13.16) into the \"language\" of another observable to implement this method, because each energy eigenfunction of this system is also a parity eigenfunction. [That is, the expansion of W(x, t) we use to predict the outcome of a parity measurement looks identical to the one we would use to analyze an energy measurement.] But we do need to think carefully about the meaning of the coefficients in Eq. (13.16). Let's look first at the odd-parity possibility. It's a trivial matter to calculate from Eq. (13.16) the probability that in Mn[tnl a member will exhibit the value -1. Since the coefficient of the odd-parity term in (13.16) is cin)(O) = 3/v'38, we have 19This section contains the most complicated example yet of multiple measurements . If you are running out of time. you can omit it and press on to the next section. :lÂ°I choose tn = 0 solely to simplify the form of some of the results in this example. This choice in no way affects the physics or problem-solving strategy. 606 Chap. 13 Altered States (13.18) (13.19) P( -1 , tn) =Ivkl 2 = 0.2368. Analyzing the other possibility, that Mn[tnl will collapse the oscillator into an even-parity state, is a bit trickier. There are two terms in (13.16) that correspond to this possibility: the ground state, with probability amplitude 2/ V38, and the second excited state, with amplitude -5/V38. So the overall probability of getting II = +1 in Mn[tnl is the sum of the probabilities for each of these terms : P(+l,tn) = I~r+ 1-~12= 0.7632. Notice that, satisfyingly, the probabilities for the two possible outcomes of the parity measurement sum to one. It may help to think about this analysis in the following way: it's as if there were two \"routes\" to even parity: one corresponding to the ground state, the other to the second excited state. In probability theory we add probabilities for mutually-exclusive possibilities, so Eq. (13.19) is the correct way to calculate the probability of (one way or the other) getting even parity in Mn[tnl. But be careful with this analogy; the parity measurement does not throw members that yield +1 into one or the other of the stationary states 1/Jo(x) or 1/J2(X); rather, as we'll see in a moment, this measurement forces them into an (unknown) superposition of these states. Warning Note that we add the probabilities for the two (or more) terms that correspond to the same value of a measurement observable, not the probability amplitudes. Question 13-8 How would Eqs. (13.18) and (13.19) change if tn > O? Question 13-9 There are only two possible outcomes of Mn [tn): +1 and -1. The sum of the probabilities for these outcomes, Eqs. (13.18) and (13.19) is, happily, equal to I. Suppose we computed P(+I, tn) by adding the probability amplitudes rather than the probabilities. Show that this gambit does not lead to a total probability of I. The states of the two sub-ensembles created by the parity measurement are indicated in the diagram in Fig. 13.9. Understanding the odd-parity outcome is easy . Since the only odd-parity term in the wave function prior to Mn[tnl, Eq. (13.16), is the one for the first excited state, each member that exhibits II = -1 collapses into this eigenstate. The wave function of such a member after Mn[tnl is therefore 'lh(x) e- iElt/h . Were we to perform a subsequent energy measurement on the sub-ensemble of odd-parity oscillators, we would find only the value E 1 = 3nwo/2. So the odd-parity sub-ensemble behaves just like the one in Example 13.4. Not so the even-parity sub-ensemble. The rules of quantum mechanics demand that the state of this sub-ensemble after Mn[tnl be an eigenstate of IT with eigenvalue +1. But these rules do not specify which even-parity state will result. In a real measurement, Sec. 13.5 Multiple Measurements II: An Example 607 0< t < tn 'It(x. tl---.~EJ IAE>ol LAn >oJ 1/1, (xl e- iE,tlh [An = 0) ---....~B---~. 1/Il(xle- iE, tl h %hwo (AE=O) IAn ~ol LAE=~ Figure 13.9 Measurement diagram for a simultaneous measurement of parity and energy on the initial SHO state represented by Eq. (13.16). The superpos ition referred to as the even-parity outcome of M n [tnl is given in Eq. (13.20). the resulting state could be the ground state, the second excited state, or a superposition of the two, i.e., (13.20) But we are here considering only ideal measurements, and for such a measurement we can determine the ratio of d~E)(t) to d~E)(t) in (13.20). Let's see how. An ideal measurement of parity introduces the least possible disturbance in the energy-related properties of the system . This does not mean that Mn[tn] doesn't change these properties at all. For example, the state for t < tn, Eq. (13.16), allows for the possibility that a member will exhibit E 1 in a subsequent energy measurement. But this possibility is not present in the (even-parity) superposition (13.20). What, then, does \"least possible disturbance\" mean in this case? Well, one important energy-related property of the system prior to Mn[tn] is that the energy of a particle is not sharp. Since the parity measurement need not collapse members that exhibit 11 = +1 into an energy eigenstate, it won't do so-and the energy of the even-parity ensemble after an ideal Mn[tn] will still not be sharp.\" That is, the disturbance in the energy-related properties of the state (13.20) will be less if both coefficients d~E)(t) and d~E)(t) are non-zero than if one of them is zero. To pin down the coefficients in Eq. (13.20), we must think more deeply about this matter of a \"minimal disturbance.t'V The squared moduli of these coefficients are probabilities: e.g., Id~E)(tW is the probability that an energy measurement on the sub- 21Careful now. It should be evident from Eqs. (13.16) and (13.20) that the value of t::..E will be changed by the parity measurement. If not, glance ahead to Table 13.1. 22See H. Araki and M. M. Yanese, Phys. Rev. A, 120,622 (1960) and J. Cohn, Amer. Jour. Phys., 36, 749 (1968). 608 Chap. 13 Altered States ensemble in this state will yield the value Eo = mvo/2. That is, these coefficients contain information about the distribution ofpossible energies that is implicit in the wave function Eq. (13.20) . The least possible disturbance in the energy-related properties of the oscillator is one that doesn 't change this distribution for the allowed energies Eo and E 2 from what it was before Mn[tnl. For these two energies, the probability amplitudes in the state before the parity measurement are to be found in Eq. (13.16). These amplitudes correspond to a distribu- tion in which the probability for Eo is 4/38 = 0.1053 and for E2 is 25/38 = 0.6579. The ratio of the probability for E2 to that for Eo is 6.25. We can preserve the energy distributionfor Eo and E2 by choosing the coefficients in the state function after Mn[tnl [in Eq. (13.20)) to maintain this ratio: (13.21) This reasoning may seem complicated, so here's a summary. To minimize the effect of a parity measurement on the energy properties of the oscillator we must ensure that there is no change due to Mn[tnl in the relative probabilities for obtaining the energies of the ground state and the second-excited state, the only two possibilities for the even-parity sub-ensemble. The probabilities for these energies are just the squared moduli of the energy probability amplitudes in the state functions before and after the parity measurement, so by equating the ratio of these squared moduli as in (13.21) we can preserve the relative probabilities. We cannot preserve the absolute energy probabilities , because the wave function before Mn[tnl contains a possibility that is not present for the even-parity sub-ensemble that results from this measurement-namely, the possibility of the (odd-parity) first ex- cited state . The presence in Eq. (13.16) of this possibility, represented by the term proportional to 'lh (x) e- i E t t /h, affects the values of the coefficients ch E )(t) in this func- tion, because these coefficients must be normalized so that (13.22)t < tn.(w Iw) = Ic~E)12+ Ic~E)12+ HE)\\2 = 1 [This requirement is reflected in the prefactor 1/J38 in Eq. (13.16).] The corresponding normalization condition for the state (13.20) (after the parity measurement) is t > tn . (13.23) Now, if you're still with me, all we need do is choose d~E)(t) and d~E)(t) to conform to Eqs . (13.21) and (13.23). Doing so leads to a wave function that is almost completely determined. The remaining indeterminacy is a familiar one : we cannot specify the phase of each coefficient in (13.20) . Denoting the phase constants for the Eo and E2 terms by 00 and 02, respectively, we can write (finally!) the fonn of the state function after an ideal parity measurement: (13.24) Whew! Sec. 13.5 Multiple Measurements II: An Example 609 (13.25) Question 13-10 Verify that the wave function (13.24) is correctly normalized, Now calculate the probabilities that would be obtained in an energy measurement using this normalized wave function and verify that (13.24) predicts the same relative distribution for Eo and E2 as does (13.16). Let's examine the state function (13.24) to see what changes the parity measure- ment has wrought. Recall that before Mn[tn], energy and parity were uncertain. The superposition state after this measurement has the following properties: 1. An = 0 2. AE> 0 3. the relative distribution of energy probabilities for E 2 and Eo is the same as before Mn[tn] [Eq. (13.21)]. A closer look reveals that the values of the statistical properties related to en- ergy were changed by the parity measurement. This change is evident in Table 13.1, which contains the values of the expectation value and uncertainty in the energy be- fore and after Mn[tn]. The \"after values\" in this table correspond to the even-parity sub-ensemble. This change should come as no great surprise, because the mixture of energy eigenstates in this sub-ensemble is different from that of the original ensemble.

(This exercise is easy and provides valuable practice.) One reason for going through the analysis leading to Eq. (13.24) is that we need this wave function to predict the outcome of the second measurement, which you may have forgotten. At the beginning of this section, we proposed to follow the parity measurement by an energy measurement. The analysis of this second experiment is quite simple, as you can see by another look at Fig. 13.9. An energy measurement has no effect on the state of the odd-parity sub-ensemble. It does, however, collapse the members of the even-parity sub-ensemble into one of two energy eigenstates-either the ground state or the second excited state. The probabilities for these outcomes are easy to calculate from (13.24), to wit: P(Eo) = 0.14 P(E2 ) = 0.86. 610 Chap. 13 Altered States Question 13-12 According to (13.18) the probability of a member of the original ensemble winding up with sharp energy El is 9/38 = 0.24 . The sum of this and the probabilities in (13.25) is 1.24. But the probability of a member winding up with energy Eo or E 1 or E2 should be 1. What went wrong? Summary Simultaneous measurement of compatible observables is not forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics. If the state prior to the experiment happens to be a simultaneous eigenstate of the measured observables, then the measurement need not-and in an ideal measurement will not-change the state. But if the initial state is not an eigenstate of either observable, then the measurement forces the members into a state in which both observables are sharp. These conclusions , however, depend on the compatibility of the measured observables. What happens if the little beggars are incompatible? Stay tuned. *13.6 DUELING OBSERVABLES: MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS OF INCOMPATIBLE OBSERVABLES Ah! my dear Watson. there we come into those realms of conjecture, where the most logical mind may be at fault. Each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is as likely to be correct as mine. -Sherlock Holmes, in The Adventure of the Empty House by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The easiest part of analyzing a multiple measurement is determining the effect of the first experiment. Whether or not the observables are compatible, the first measurement collapses the system into a state in which the measured observable is sharp (unless, of course, the system was already in such a state). The fun begins when we tum to the second measurement , which forces the system into an eigenstate of the other observable . If this observable is incompatible with the first, then the state after the second experiment is one in which the first observable is no longer sharp. That is, measuring one observable can change the properties of the system relating to another. As we'll see, this seemingly magical alteration of the state is an unavoidable consequence of the non-commutativity of the operators that represent the measured observables. Inescapable Changes of State You must remember this: non-commuting operators do not define a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions. In general, no states exist in which the uncertainties of two non-commuting operators are zero. (Recall that we agreed to exclude the exceptional case Sec. 13.6 Multiple Measurements of Incompatible Observables 611 of a single simultaneous eigenfunction of two non-commuting operators.) For example, if Q and R do not commute, then in any eigenstate of Q the incompatible observable R must be uncertain, and vice versa. This familiar property is the key to understanding multiple measurements of incompatible observables. Let's consider only the \"second\" measurement. That is, let's pretend that we are given an ensemble of systems that are initially in an eigenstate of Q,23 (13.26) On this ensemble we are going to measure the incompatible observable Rat t n- In the state (13.26) the observable Q is sharp, i.e. AQ(O) = 0 (13.27) In the measurement MR[tR] each member of the ensemble could exhibit any of the eigenvalues of R [see Eq. (13.llb)). But not all members will exhibit the same value, for R is necessarily uncertain: AR(O) > 0 (13.28) To learn more about the outcome of MR[tR], we could use the machinery of Chap. 12 to predict the probabilities for each allowed value. We translate the state function (13.26) into the language of R via expansion in the complete set {X~)}, viz., (13.29) m The probability amplitude for eigenvalue T m is (13.30) In the initial state X~Q),the observable R cannot be sharp, so the probabilities P(Tm , 0) = Ic~)(OW will be non-zero for at least two of the eigenvalues T m . There is nothing particularly unusual in the analysis of Eqs. (13.28HI3.30). But now let's tum to the \"Q-related properties\" of the state after measurement of R. This measurement changed the state function into an eigenfunction of R. For example, the sub-ensemble of members that exhibited T m in MR[tR] winds up in a state represented by the corresponding eigenfunction: [an instant after MR[tR]1 (13.31) If we calculate AQ for this state, we get a positive number; i.e., in the state after MR[tRl, the observable Q must be uncertain. The reason, as argued above, is simply that the state function that results from MR[tRl cannot be one in which both Q and R are sharp, for such simultaneous eigenstates (of incompatible observables) do not exist. 23For convenience, we'll initialize our clock (t = 0) at the instant prior to tR. In practice, we could have prepared the system in such a state by measuring Q immediately before the measurement of R, i.e., at t R - St, From the resulting members, we select a sub-ensemble of systems that exhibited the same eigenvalue of Q. [If Q is a constant of the motion, we could have performed MQ[tQ] a finite time before MR[tR), for once MQ[tQ] has collapsed the system into an eigenstate of a constant of the motion, it will remain in that eigenstate, evolving according to the TDSE, until a second measurement (of an incompatible observable) is performed.] 612 Chap. 13 Altered States So a multiple measurement of incompatible observables causes the state to \"flip- flop\" between eigenstates of each observable.v' t < tR } LlQ =0 LlR> 0 So here is the rule for this case: { t> tR LlQ > 0 LlR=O (13.32) Rule Measurement of one of two incompatible observables (on a state in which the other ob- servable is sharp) induces an unavoidable, uncontrollable uncertainty in the unmeasured observable. Example 13.5. The Anharmonic Oscillator In Chap. 9 we studied at length the stationary states of the simple harmonic oscillator. These energy eigenstates are also parity eigenstates, because the potential energy (13.33) is symmetric with respect to x = 0, i.e., V(-x) = V(x). The SHO is a valuable model of low-energy vibrational states of diatomic molecules. To use it thus, we let x in (13.33) represent the deviation of the internuclear separation R from its equilibrium value Re , i.e., x = R - Re â€¢ But this model is crude, and to represent accurately the vibrational states of some molecules (particularly high-lying states) we must resort to model potentials that more accurately reflect the shape of the molecular potential curve [cf , Fig. 9.14]. One prominent feature of such actual molecular potentials is their lack ofsymmetry about equilibrium. the point R = R e . So one criterion we would build into a more accurate model potential V(M)(x) is this lack of symmetry with respect to x = 0, (13.34) Because of this condition, the Hamiltonian it.(M) of a particle of mass m with such a model potential, ' 2 it.(M) = L + V(M)(x) (13.35) 2m does not commute with the parity operator. So for this model, parity and energy are incompatible, and there are no simultaneous eigenstates of these observables. Unlike the stationary states of the SHO, those of the more realistic Hamiltonian are not also eigenstates of parity. 24Note carefully that this change occurs even though the measurement is \"ideal.\" An ideal measurement of one of two compatible observables need not-and therefore does not-e-change the properties of the other observable. But any measurement of one of two incompatible observables may have to change the properties of the other observable . If such a measurement is ideal, however. these changes are minimal (consistent with the laws of quantum physics). Sec. 13.6 Multiple Measurements of Incompatible Observables 613 Question 13-13 Devise an asymmetric potential V(M)(x) and for it, evaluate the commutator of il(M) and the parity operator. Write down the Generalized Uncertainty Principle for energy and parity. Discuss the implications of your answer for measurement of the energy on various kinds of states of this system. With this background, let's consider a state of a molecule whose vibrational motion we represent with an asymmetric potential. For my own nefarious reasons, I want to consider what may seem to you a capricious choice of initial condition: suppose the state of interest is initially in the ground state of the simple harmonic oscillator potential. That's right: even though we are not using the SHO to model the molecule, we'll consider the initial wave function (13.37) where, of course, our old friend /3 is just J mwo In. This wave function is an eigenfunction of II, so at the instant t = 0 the particle is in a parity eigenstate. What does this mean about the energy at this instant? The energy must be uncertain, for there are no simultaneous eigenfunctions of il(M) and ft. The function (13.37) is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian of the simple harmonic oscillator, not of the asymmetric Hamiltonian (13.36). So if (13.37) is the initial condition of a particle in such a potential, it represents a state for which ~E(O) > O. Now let's imagine measuring the energy at tE = O. Of course, each member of the ensemble will yield one of the eigenvalues E~M) of Eq. (13.36). The energy probability amplitudes are just the projections of the state function immediately before ME[tEl on the eigenfunctions t/J~M) of (13.36). These amplitudes appear in the expansion oc \\IT(x,O) = L c~E)(O)t/J~M)(x). n=O For the initial state (13.37), they are25 (13.38) (13.39) The probabilities Ic~E)(OW describe the likelihood that each member of the original en- semble will wind up in one of the sharp-energy sub-ensembles that results from ME[te]. Our energy measurement has dramatically changed the energy properties of the original ensemble. But it has also changed the parity properties, even though we did not measure this observable. The parity of the initial state (13.37) was sharp; the parity of each sub-ensemble created by Me[tEl is not sharp. Because ft does not commute with il(M), an energy measurement collapses the system into a state in which parity is uncertain-another flip-flop: 25Notice that the integral represented by the Dirac braket (1/J~M) 11/J0) is not equal to 6n .0. The function 1/Jo(x) is an eigenfunction of the SHO Hamiltonian, while 1/J~M) is an eigenfunction of our model Hamiltonian. 614 Chap. 13 Altered States t < tE } an = 0 aE>O { t> tE an> 0 aE=O (13.40) Question 13-14 Draw a branch diagram like the one in Fig. 13.8 for the energy measurement in this example. Then add to your diagram additional branches to show the outcome of a subsequent measure- ment of the parity on each sub-ensemble that resulted from the initial energy measurement. (To simplify your diagram, show only three branches resulting from each measurement.) Discuss briefly how the system evolves during the time interval after ME[tE] and before Mrr[trr]. Example 13.6. The Energy and Linear Momentum of a SUO In Â§ 13.3 we explored simultaneous measurements of the energy and parity of a one- dimensional simple harmonic oscillator, two compatible observables. Two observables of this system we know to be incompatible are the energy and linear momentum. In Exam- ple 11.2 we derived the commutator of their operators, [1t\" \"] 'n 2 \",p = t TnWOX. (13.41) The non-commutativity of if. and jJ implies that in an eigenstate of one of these operators, the other operator must be uncertain. The uncertainties and eigenfunctions are summarized in Table 13.2. TABLE 13.2 ENERGY AND MOMENTUM EIGENSTATES OF THE SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR.

It may strike you as curious that the momentum eigenfunction Xp(x), which is an energy eigenstate of thefree par- ticle, represents a state of the simple harmonic oscillator in which the energy is not sharp . We can easily convince ourselves that the energy in this state is indeed uncertain. The energy uncertainty is (13 .42) For a momentum eigenstate, both (T) and (T 2 ) are zero. (Why?) So the energy uncertainty (13.42) simplifies to tiE = J(V2) - (V)2 = ~71UJJ~J(X2)- (X)2. (l3 .43a) (I3.43b) Sec. 13.6 Multiple Measurements of Incompatible Observables 615 Now, the mean value of position for a momentum eigenstate, (x), is zero; but (x 2 ) > 0 (see the next Question). This is why the energy of a SHO in a momentum eigenstate is uncertain : tlE > O. Question 13-IS It is not necessary to evaluate (x 2 ) to convince yourself that this quantity must be positive for the SHO oArgue the case from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the expression for the position uncertainty that is analogous to (13.42). Suppose we measure the linear momentum and select from the results the sub- ensemble corresponding to the eigenvalue PO . 26 Immediately after Mp[tp], at time te, we measure the energy . The branch diagram for this measurement is shown in Fig. 13.10. Ap =0 AE>O \"'1 (x) e -iE,tlh AE=O Ap >0 Figure 13.10 A branch diagram for an energy measurement on a simple harmonic oscillator that is initially in a momentum eigenstate . For simplicity, only three of the infinity of branches are shown. The energy measurement causes the system to collapse into an energy eigenstate. The probability of a member winding up in the nth stationary state of the SHO is, as usual, n = 0,1 ,2, . .. . (13.44) The first few probabilities are easy to evaluate; we worked out the integrals (tPn I Xpo) for n = 0 and n = 1 in Chap . 12, while toiling in Example 12.8. For instance, from Eq. (12.123a) we find (tPo IXpo), which we can use in (13.44) to determine the probability that a member will collapse into the ground state: Question 13-16 Evaluate the probability that a member will exhibit the value E 1 = 3hwo/2 in the energy measurement. Fine. But the central question here is what has the energy measurement done to the momentum properties of the oscillator? Remember that the state prior to ME[tE] was characterized by a sharp momentum, p = pÂ«. But after ME/tE], the system is in an energy eigenstate, so its linear momentum is uncertain (see Table 13.2). For example, the momentum uncertainty for the sub-ensemble with energy Eo is tlp(t E +at) = J mhwo /2 . Once again a measurement of one of two incompatible observables (here the energy) has changed characteristics of the system that relate to the other, unmeasured observable (here, the momentum). 26 As we know from Chap. 8. momentum eigenstates are not normalizable and hence do not truly exist in nature. So to be precise in this analysis, we should speak of a sub-ensemble of systems in a state represented by a very fat wave packet whose momentum probability amplitude is very sharply peaked about Po. 616 Chap. 13 Altered States Uncertainty in Action We have seen that after measurement of one of two incompatible observables, the system is in a state in which the unmeasured observable is necessarily uncertain. Imagine a series of successive measurements of two incompatible observables: first MQ[tQ], then, immediately thereafter, MR[tR], then MQ[tQ] again, . . .. These measurements cause the system to \"flip-flop\" between states in which one or the other of the observables (but not both) is sharp. Uncertainty originates in the commutator properties of operators and in the formal relationship between commutativity and the possible existence of simultaneous eigen- states. The genesis and role of uncertainty in the mathematics of quantum physics is one of the most profound examples of a theme I have emphasized throughout this book: an understanding of the physics of microscopic systems, at the experimental level of mea - surement and prediction of their properties, is inextricably linked to an understanding of the abstract mathematics of quantum mechanics. This deep interrelationship, which goes far beyond the mere assertion that \"mathematics is the language of physics,\" is one of the great and abiding beauties of quantum physics. 13.7 FINAL THOUGHTS: MYSTERIES ABOUND . . . every branch of human knowledge if traced up to its source and final principles vanishes into mystery. -The Novel of the White Powder by Arthur Machen In this chapter, we have delved into one of the great mysteries of nature: the effect of measurement on a quantum state. Actually, the effect itself is not mysterious-quantum mechanics provides a representation of the various states of a system that could result from a measurement and a way to calculate the probabilities that the system will wind up in each of these states. The mystery is, how does this work? By what magic does the interaction of a microscopic system and a measuring apparatus bring about this change? This is the problem of measurement , and I don't have a satisfactory solution to it. One response to this problem is to ignore it, i.e., just accept quantum mechanics as a collection of (remarkably successful) tools for the quantitative analysis of physical systems. I suspect that this is the attitude of most practicing physicists. It is the stance that the Nobel laureate Richard P. Feynman recommends in his wonderful book The Character of Physical Law (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967): There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity. 1 do not believe that there ever was such a time. . . . On the other hand, I think it is safe to say that no one understands quantum mechanics. . . . Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, \"But how can it be like that?\" because you will get \"down the drain\" into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that. Underlying the problem of measurement there is a deeper question. As a conse- quence of an ensemble measurement of an observable Q, the original state collapses into Sec. 13.7 Final Thoughts: Mysteries Abound 617 one of the eigenstates of Q. The question is: what mechanism determines which eigen- state a particular member collapses into? According to the conventional epistemology of quantum mechanics, the answer is that random chance governs what happens to each member of an ensemble. Many (your author included) consider this no answer at all. This question lurks just beneath the surface of most of the examples in this chapter. In Example 13.2, for example, we considered a system that prior to measurement was in a superposition of two eigenstates of the observable being measured. Upon measurement, each member collapses into one of these eigenstates.F This much quantum mechanics can tell us. It can also tell us the probability that each member will collapse into one of these eigenstates. What it cannot tell us is precisely what will happen to a particular member of the ensemble. That information is forever shrouded in the fundamental unknowability of nature. No less a figure than Albert Einstein found this situation unsatisfactory. In a letter to Max Born in 1926, Einstein wrote28 Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice. Always More Questions Since the early days of quantum theory, physicists have tried to understand the collapse of the state function. Perhaps the most remarkable of these efforts is that of John Von Neu- mann. In his research on measurement theory, Von Neumann used quantum mechanics to describe both the (microscopic) systems on which a measurement is performed and the (macroscopic) measuring apparatus. The central question he addressed is: at what step in the measurement process does the collapse of the wave function occur? For example, in the single slit experiment (Â§ 13.2), does the wave packet collapse into an eigenstate of position when the electron interacts with phosphor molecules at the detector? ... when these molecules emit a photon, enabling us to see that the electron has arrived? . .. when an observer sees one of the photons? . . . or at some other point in the experiment? Von Neumann arrived by a mathematical analysis at a remarkable answer: the collapse of the wave function of a quantum system occurs when a physical signal from a measurement device is registered by a human consciousness. From this conclusion, some physicists have come to an even more astounding inference: microscopic particles do not have well-defined physical attributes until a human mind perceives that they do. Such conclusions seem extreme. Yet, they are logically consistent with the Copen- hagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. As you might imagine, this state of affairs 27A state function cannot collapse into an eigenstate that is not represented in its expansion in eigen- functions of the operator that represents the measured observable. That is, if the projection of the state function on a particular eigenfunction is zero , then the probability of finding the system in that eigenstate after mea- surement is 1012 = 0. Obviously, a measurement of the observable cannot collapse the state function into such an eigenfunction. 28Quoted in A. Pais's scientific biography of Einstein, \"Subtle Is the Lord . . . .. The Science and Life of Albert Einstein (Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1980). If you have even the slightest interest in Einstein as a scientist or as a man, you should rush out right now and buy a copy of this splendid book. Einstein 's correspondence with Born sheds cons iderable light on quantum physics; it has been collected in The Born-Einstein Letters, edited by M. Born (New York: Walker, 1971). 618 Chap. 13 Altered States has led many physicists to search for alternative interpretations. Their fascinating theories are, alas, outside the scope of this book.29 The End of All Our Exploring So to what place have we come? We have learned the underlying concepts, basic tools, and fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, a powerful and successful mathematical theory for predicting the behavior of microscopic systems. We have seen how quantum theory reduces to classical physics in the appropriate limit. And we have learned how to express its concepts in terms of state functions and operators and how to manipulate these elements to solve practical problems. (You will see much more of this in Volume II of this book.) Yet, quantum theory remains fraught with mysteries and marvels. Einstein went to his grave convinced that in some fundamental way, quantum mechanics is incomplete. Even now, the issue is unresolved. From the standpoint in this book, which presents only the \"standard\" (Copenhagen) interpretation of quantum mechanics, we must accept the troublesome questions that lurk at the frontiers of our understanding of the physical universe: Just how does a measurement wreak its changes on a state function? Do physicists study reality or a self-generated chimera of reality, and is there a difference between the two? What powers actually govern what happens to an individual member of an ensemble? And on and on and on. These are the great unanswered questions of quantum physics. ANNOTATED SELECTED READINGS The literature of the measurement theory and its implications for the nature of reality is vast and fascinating. A recent review that will take you deep into this theory is l. Bohm, D., B. J. Hiley, and P. N. Kaloyerou, \"An Ontological Basis for the Quantum Theory,\" Phys. Repts., 144,321 (1987). There are no true textbooks on this subject, but you'll find a wealth of information clearly explained in 2. d'Espagnat, B., Conceptual Foundations of Quantum Mechanics , 2nd ed. (Reading, Mass: W. A. Benjamin, 1976). Maybe you want something a little less advanced. If so, I strongly encourage you to seek out one of the popularizations listed in the Selected Readings for Chap. 2, to which I would add 3. Polkinghorne, J. C., The Quantum World (London: Longmann, 1984). 4. Mermin, N. David, \"Quantum Mysteries for Everyone,\" Jour . Phil., 78, 397 (1981). And, for historical background, 5. Crease, R. P., and Mann, C. C., The Second Creation: Makers of the Revolution in 20th- Century Physics (New York: Macmillan, 1987). 29But 1don't want to leave you with the impression that none of the alternative formulations of quantum mechanics are viable. Several are. Alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation include hidden variable theories, semiclassical interpretations, the many-worlds interpretation, the advanced-action interpretation, and a nonlocal model of reality. The most readable introduction to these interpretations is Quantum Reality: Beyond the New Physics by Nick Herbert (New York: Anchor Press, 1985). A useful overview of hidden-variable theories is given in A Survey of Hidden-Variables by F. J. Belinfante (New York: Pergamon, (973). And you can find a more advanced, up-to-date discussion of these issues in Open Questions in Quantum Physics, edited by G. Tarozzi and A. A. van der Merwe (Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Reidel, 1985). Happy reading. Annotated Selected Readings 619 EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS It's a beginning. It's an end. I leave to you the problem of ordering your perceptions and making the journey from one to the other. -from Empire Star by Samuel R. Delaney Exercises 13.1 Interchangeable Measurements. Consider two states of a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator. The state 1111 is a superposition of the first two stationary states; the (unnormalized) initial condition for this state is (13.1.1 ) The second state, 1112, is the stationary state with energy 5Tuvo/2. [a] At t = 0 the parity of each state is measured. Draw branch diagrams for each state showing the effect on them of Mn[tn]. [bJ A short time after M n [tn], we measure the energy of each sub-ensemble that was created in the measurements of part raj. Complete your branch diagram, showing the effect of ME[tE] on each state. [c] Suppose that instead of the measurements in [a] and [b], we first measure E, then measure Il . Draw branch diagrams for this case. Discuss the differences (if any) between your diagram for this sequence and that of part [b]. Problems 13.1 Measurements on an Infinite Square Well Consider a neutron of mass m n in an infinite square well of width L = 15 fermi. In an ensemble energy measurement at t = 0, we find that 1/10 of the members exhibit the value 21r2 1i?/m n L 2 and 9/10 exhibit the value 2251r2 1i 2 /2m n L 2 â€¢ [a] Write down the wave function of this system prior to the energy measurement. [b] Draw a branch diagram showing the effect of this measurement on the state. [c] Suppose that at t = 0 we measure the parity instead ofthe energy . What is the probability that Mn[tn] will collapse the state in part [a] into an even-parity eigenstate? .. . an odd- parity eigenstate? [d] What is the mean value of Il that would be obtained in the measurement of part [c)? [e) Do your answers to parts [c] and [d) depend on Mn[tn]? Explain your answer. If] Suppose the ensemble suffers an infinitesimal perturbation at t = 0 causing it to decay to the ground state, emitting a photon in the process. Find the frequencies of the photons that will be emitted by various members of the ensemble. 13.2 Reviewing Measurement Theory Suppose that the initial state of a particle of mass m in a SHO potential is represented by the (unnormalized) wave function 620 Chap. 13 W(x,O) = tPl(X) + 4tPa(x) + 2tP5(X) - itP6(X), Altered States (13.2.1) where 1/Jn(X) is the nth Hamiltonian eigenfunction for the SHO potential. At time tn > 0, we perform an ensemble measurement of the parity. A finite time after this measurement, at t e. we measure the energy of each sub-ensemble that resulted from Mn[tn). la] Write down an expression for the wave function of the original ensemble for times 0< t < tn . [b] Calculate the average value and uncertainty of the parity for the state in part [a]. Ic] In Mn[tn], what is the probability that a member of the original ensemble will exhibit the eigenvalue +I? . . . the value -l? [d] Consider the sub-ensemble of members that exhibited odd parity. Write down the normalized state function of this sub-ensemble for tn < t < t e. Ie] Now tum to the energy measurement at te on the sub-ensemble of part [d]. In this measurement, will all members exhibit the same value of E? Why or why not? If] If your answer to part [e] is yes, give the value of the (sharp) energy of the state. If your answer is no, list the values that will be exhibited by various members of the ensemble and evaluate the correspond ing energy probabilities . Ig] Will ME[tE) of part [e] necessarily change the state of the system? If your answer is no, explain why not. If it is yes, write down the wave function(s) after the energy measurement. 13.3 The Final Problem: More Measurements A particle of mass m in an infinite square well of width L whose left wall is at x = O. At t = 10 sec, an infinitesimal perturbation causes the particle to emit a photon of (angular) frequency w = 31r 2lij(2mL 2 ) . la) From the above information only, a student concludes : \"Prior to the photon emission , the particle was in the first excited state (n = 2) of the infinite square well.\" Critique this statement: is it correct? Why or why not? If not, what is the faulty assumption that underlies it? Ib] Suppose we are given the additional information that all members of the ensemble emitted a photon of the frequency w at t = 10 sec. Is this sufficient to draw the above quoted conclusion? Explain your answer fully. 13.4 Measuring a Constant of the Motion A particle of mass m with a symmetric potential that supports only bound states is initially in a non-stationary state. In terms of the eigenfunctions 1/Jn(X) of the Hamiltonian of the system, this state is the superposition (13.4.1) At time t > 0, the parity of this system is measured. [a] Does the initial state have definite parity? What is III (-x, O)? Ib] Write down the normalized wave function for t > 0 (before the parity measurement is performed). Ic] Is parity a constant of the motion of this system? Id] What is the probability of obtaining the value +1 (even parity) in the parity measurement? Ie] What is the probability of obtaining -1 (odd parity)? Hint: Be careful in working part [e], For the state (13.4.1) there are two \"routes\" to the odd-parity result. Remember that we add the probabilities for alternate routes to a given result.

MORRISON UI\\IDER!iTAI\\IDII\\lIi QUANTUM PHY!iI[!i A USER'S MANUAL Designed for a wide range of readers interested in various branches of physics and engineering physics. this exciting new book is a uniquely engaging introduction to the concepts and strategies of quantum mechanics, the foundation of humans' understanding of the microscopic universe. Written in an informal yet substantive style, Understanding Quantum Physics is filled with clear, well-motivated. thorough explanations that help readers develop insight into physical ideas and master techniques for problem solving using quantum mechanics. Illuminating these discussions of ideas and techniques are a multitude of examples that show readers not just the answers but also the reasoning behind them. This pedagogically rich book also provides a wealth of in-text thought questions , end-of- chapter exercises. and problems. The latter. replete with detailed suggestions and helpful hints, \"talk\" readers through important text material-and beyond-into more exotic concepts and real-world applications . Understanding Quantum Physics features thirteen chapters carefully subdivided into sections and sub-sections: footnotes and asides containing extensions of the text and references to the literature of physics: annotated lists of Selected Readings: an unusually comprehensive set of Appendixes: and numerous tables that summarize critical material. Its many learning aids. lively and engaging style. thorough explanations. and wealth of examples make Understanding Quantum Physics a joy. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Michael A.
