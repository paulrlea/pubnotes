Show that for G = SU (5), the anomaly cancels between the 5∗ and the 10. Note that for SU (N), we can, with no loss of generality , take A, B, and C to be the same, so that the anomaly is determined by the trace of a generator cubed (namely, TrT 3 ). It is rare that we get something cubed in physics, and so any cancellation between irreducible representations can hardly be accidental. Easiest to use diagonal generator . T = diag ( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 , − 1 2 , − 1 2 ) Taking this diagonal generator , we evaluate the trace of the generator cubed in the 5* dimensional representation. All entries are real: (multiply by 6) T ∗ = diag (2, 2, 2, −3, −3) Cubing this matrix: T ∗3 = diag (8, 8, 8, −27, −27) Taking the trace: Tr(T ∗3) = −30 Now for the 10-dimensional representation: Basis for 10-d representation: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5) Converting the 5-d diagonal matrix to a 10-d representation T10 d = diag(d1 + d2, d1 + d3, d1 + d4, d1 + d5, d2 + d3, d2 + d4, d2 + d5, d3 + d4, d3 + d5, d4 + d5) T10 d = diag(4, 4, −1, −1, 4, −1, −1, −1, −1, −6) Cubing this diagonal matrix: T 3 10 d = diag(64, 64, −1, −1, 64, −1, −1, −1, −1, −216) Taking the trace: TrT 3 10 d = 3(64) − 222 = 192 − 222 = −30 30 − (−30) = 0","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
