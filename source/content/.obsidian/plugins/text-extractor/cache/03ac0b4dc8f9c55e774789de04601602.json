(b) Use the conservation of probability equation 𝜕Ψ∗Ψ 𝜕𝑡 = − 𝜕𝑗𝑥 𝜕𝑥 to argue that the probability current must also vanish in the region x< 0 as well for this energy eigenfunction. What can you therefore conclude about the magnitude of the reflection coefficient? 33) Townsend Problem 4.25 34) Townsend Problem 4.26 (There is a significant amount of algebra necessary for this one.) 35) A proton and a deuteron (a particle with the same charge as a proton, but twice the mass) attempt to penetrate a rectangular potential barrier of height 10 Me V and thickness 10-14 m. Both particles have total energies of 3 MeV. (a) Use qualitative arguments to predict which particle has the highest probability of succeeding. (b) Evaluate quantitatively the probability of success for both particles.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
