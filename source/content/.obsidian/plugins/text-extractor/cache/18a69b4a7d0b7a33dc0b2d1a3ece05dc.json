Complete an academic essay of 1,500 words on one of the following ques6ons: 1. Cri6cally analyse the claim that computer simula6ons enhance our understanding and predic6ve capabili6es in scien6ﬁc and engineering disciplines. 2. Examine the epistemic challenges associated with computer simula6ons in Science and Engineering, focusing on issues of valida6on and the interpreta6on of results. 3. What ethical considera6ons arise in the development and use of computer simula6ons in scien6ﬁc and engineering contexts? Discuss this ques6on using a contemporary example that highlights poten6al societal impacts. 4. Cri6cally assess the extent to which the integra6on of ar6ﬁcial intelligence into computer simula6ons represents a true paradigm shiD in Science and Engineering, or simply an evolu6on of exis6ng methodologies. 5. To what extent do computer simula6ons act as instruments for addressing complex societal challenges? Use a speciﬁc case study related to Science and Engineering to analyse their epistemic and prac6cal contribu6ons. Guidance. You must choose one of the essay topics that are speciﬁed (stated above).

Very good to good grasp of key concepts and challenges, showing some interplay of different concepts and some critical comparison of concepts relevant to the module. Moderate to poor grasp of key concepts and challenges, with little attempt to inter- relate concepts and little critical assessment of concepts relevant to the module. Poor to complete lack of grasp of key concepts and challenges, no attempt to inter-relate concepts and no critical assessment of concepts relevant to the module. Argumentation relevant to essay topic. 45% An excellent argument, which makes a valuable intervention, flows logically, and advances a clear and compelling case. Identifying clear causal mechanisms is an advantage. A novel approach to the topic may be present. A very good to good argument, which may not be grounded or articulated as clearly as it could be. Some causal mechanisms will be identified. A novel approach may be somewhat present.
