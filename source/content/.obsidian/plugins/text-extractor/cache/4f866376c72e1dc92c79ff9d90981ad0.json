IMPORTANT NOTE: Only 2 of these problems will be graded for credit (at 10 points each)!! We will not disclose which problems are being graded before the deadline. This means that you will need to submit completed answers to all questions or risk getting a 0 if we grade a problem you didn’t do. 1. (a) Write down the Lagrangian ( )2121 ,,, xxxxL  for two particles of equal masses m1 = m2 = m confined to the x-axis and connected by a spring with potential energy ( ) 2 21 2 1 xxkU −= . [Ignore gravity and friction.] Calculate Lagrange’s diff. equations for each mass, i.e. 0=   −   ii x L x L dt d  for i = 1,2. (b) Rewrite the Lagrangian L in terms of new variables ( )21 2 1 xxX CM += (the center-of- mass position) and 21 xxx −= (relative distance between mass 1 and 2). The mass 1 remains at all times to the right of mass 2. (c) Calculate Lagrange’s equations of motion of XCM and x. Solve the differential equations for XCM(t) and x(t) and describe the motion (using full sentences). (d) Consider the differential equations for x1 and x2 and compare them to the differential equations obtained for XCM and x. What is gained by introducing XCM and x? 2. Consider a double pendulum made of two masses, m1 and m2, and two massless rods of lengths l1 and l2, as shown in the Figure [assume gravitational acceleration points down the page]. The black point at the top of the Figure is a stationary anchor point. (a) Find the Lagrangian for the system in terms of θ1 and θ2. (b) Now, simplify your Lagrangian using the assumption that the masses are identical and the lengths of the rods are identical. (m1 = m2 = m and l1 = l2 = l ) Using this simplified Lagrangian find the differential equations for θ1 and θ2. (c) Simplify your equations of motion for the case of small angle oscillations. To do this keep only the leading terms of the approximations. [Hint: if x << 1 and y << 1, then x*y <<<<1 and can therefore be ignored] You do not need to solve the differential equations for this problem. 3. A block of mass m is held motionless on a frictionless plane of mass M and an angle of inclination θ. The plane rests on a frictionless horizontal surface. The block is released from rest. Find the Lagrangian L of the block and the plane and Lagrange’s equations of motion. Solve for the accelerations of the blocks in terms of g, m, M, and θ. [You can either use the coordinates x1 and x2 that are shown in the image or you can define a new two dimensional coordinate for the block and ramp. Just be clear on what coordinates you are using.]","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
