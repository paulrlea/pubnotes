MAGNETIC EQUATION OF STATE OF CrBr, NEAR THE CRITICAL POINT* John T. Ho and J. D. Litster Physics Department and Center for Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (Received 2 January 1969) We present the results of analysis of our measurements of the magnetic properties of the insulating ferromagnet CrBr3 near its critical temperature. From this analysis we obtain a mathematical representation of an equation of state valid over the entire criti- cal region. We have used the Faraday effect to measure the magnetization M of the insulating ferromag- net CrBr, as a function of field along 30 isotherms in the temperature range T~-0.9 K &T &T&+6.7'K, where the critical temperature is T~ = 32.844 K. In this Letter we present the results of an analy- sis of our measurements and report the first de- termination of a mathematical representation for the equation of state of a ferromagnet which is valid over the entire critical region. Our mea- surements' provided the first verification of the scaling hypothesis' for an insulating or local- ized-spin ferromagnet. Experiments to test the scaling hypothesis in metallic ferromagnets have been done by more conventional methods. ' ' We define the reduced magnetization o =M/ M(0 K) and the scaled magnetization m =o ~1-T/ Tc~ P, where P gives the shape of the coexis- tence curve. Our data cover the range 0.01 «m, «6. 5 plus the critical isotherm where gpss is infi- nite. Scaling has been verified' in Cr02 for 0.12 & m& 2.3 but only for T & T . The experimental results of Kouvel and Comly' (0.42 & m & 2.8) and of Arrott and Noakes' (0.23 ~ m ~ 4.6) for nickel are consistent with scaling laws for both T & T~ and T &T~. A scaling law equation of state has been shown to hold for a number of fluids in the critical region. ' We first analyzed data near the critical iso- chore, the coexistence curve, and along the crit- ical isotherm to determine the values y= 1.215 + 0.015, P = 0.368 + 0.005, and 5 = 4.28 + 0.1. These exponents were used to compute the scaled mag- netic field h =H ~t~ f 6 and the scaled magnetiza- tion m = o If ~ ~, where t = (T-Tc)/Tc. The scaling laws predict that g is a function of m only, viz. , This is equivalent to the homogeneity argument of Widom' or the equation of state proposed by Griffiths. ' Our measurements enable an experi- mental determination of the scaling function h(m). The accuracy of our magnetization measure- ments is comparable to that of nuclear magnetic resonance and our data are sufficiently precise that we may use the experimental scaling func- tion to establish the mathematical form of h(m). This mathematical representation constitutes an equation of state valid over the entire critical 603 VOLUME 22, NUMBER 12 PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 24 MARGH 1969 region. (We define the critical region to be that over which the scaling laws hold. This is the re- gion -0.03 & t & 0.20 with g& 0.45.) To obtain a mathematical representation for the scaling function we have followed three ap- proaches. First, we have assumed'&' that the free energy is an analytic function of v, H, and t everywhere in the one-phase region. We have expanded the magnetic field in a power series about the critical isochore (a =0, t &0) and also in a power series about the critical isotherm (t =0, «0). This approach was very successful and one or the other of two simple series repre- sents h(m) well within experimental error every- where within the one-phase region. Our second approach was to attempt to find a single equation of simple form that would serve approximately over the entire critical region. Here we were not so successful. We found an equation superior to any that had been suggested previously, but it was clearly incorrect near the critical isochore. Our third approach was to seek a parametric equation of state following a suggestion of Schofield. This approach was more successful in that we obtained simple functions that fit almost within the scatter of experimental points throughout the critical region. We first discuss the power series representa- tions for the equation of state. To be consistent with the scaling laws, ' the power series near the critical isochore must have the form l4— l2— Tc = 32.844 'K x = l. 215 P =0.568 IO- + 9 8— T&Tc ~ 35 029 'K ~ 33 739 33 i42 33 034 ~ 32 98 ' 32 926 32 872 T & 32 46 32 49 32 59 32 59 32 63 32 67 ~ 32 70 ~ 32 72 32 73 32 76 32 82 tence curve (t &0) to m & 1.0 (for t &0). The co- efficients are b, = 0.63 (+3 /q), b, = 1.14 (+5 /q), and b, =0.20 (+25|//0). Widom' suggested that Eqs. (1) and (2) would be asymptotically valid for small and large values of m, respectively. The strik- ing result we find is that with only three terms in each series, Eq. (1) represents our data for 0 &m &1.8 and Eq. (2) serves for m&1.0. There- fore at any point in the critical region, one of the two equations is valid and there is consider- able region of overlap (for 1.0 &m & 1.8 and t &0) where both series will suffice. In Fig. 1 we show the experimentally determined scaling function h(m) and the fit provided by Eq. (1) (dashed line) and by Eq. (2) (solid line). The two power series are the most accurate representation of the scaling function; however, a single function which is approximately correct over the entire critical region can be found rath- 5 ~-4V0=a,at +a30' t +a,o t + or the equivalent h=a~m+a3m +asm + (1a) (1b) 7— We found that this series with just three terms fits well within the experimental error for 0 ~m &1.8 and t &0.

Widom' has pointed out that (3) will yield the scaling laws if multiplied by a homoge- neous function of degree y-1 of the variables t and ol/I . Choosing the simplest function we can think of, we obtain H=Ao(t+Bo )(t+ Ca ) I/p 1/ &-I (4) H=ar 8(1-8 ), t=r(1-28 ), o=r g(8). (5) pQ 2 2 P Although Eq. (4) is not analytic in o along the critical isochore, it is a better approximation than other simple functions that have been tried. ' If (4) is expanded about o =0, the second term is proportional to o to the power 1+ I/p = 3.7. A careful examination of our experimental h(m) shows the second term in an expansion of the correct equation of state varies as 0 to the power 3.0+0.3. Therefore we expect Eq. (4) must fail near the critical isochore. Our best fit was ob- tained with A=0.89, B=0.61, and C=2.i2; this is shown as the dotted line in Fig. 1. Agreement with the experimental results is good except for the range 0.2 &yn ~1.2; here the difference is about 10%, clearly outside the range of experi- mental error. A single representation of the scaling function which is a very good approximation over the en- tire critical region can be obtained using the parametric form suggested by Schofield. ' We make the following transformation of our mea- sured thermodynamic quantities: by a function similar to (6), but replaces (7) by m=ft/II-2U I . 2 p (6) l.2— I.O— 0.9— 0.8— 07— Using either transform one finds that U(8) and g(8) have similar mathematical forms. The function obtained for g(8) depends sensi- tively on the details of the transform chosen for II and t. Using the particular transform of Eq. (5) (with a=1.1), we obtain the function g(8) shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen from the figure, this can be very closely approximated by the equation g(8) =k8 with k= 1.24+0.04. One advan- tage of this parametric equation of state lies in the fact that it is readily integrated to obtain the free energy, and data for the entire critical re- gion may be represented on one finite graph. In conclusion, we remark that we have obtained several mathematical representations of the equation of state for CrBr, in the critical region. When only an approximate form is desired, Eq. (4) is suitable and preferable to other approxi- mations that have been suggested. ' A better ap- proximation is obtained in the parametric form of Eq. (5), and this form is most amenable to The singular behavior at the critical point is de- termined by the behavior as r- 0 and we expect g(8) to be a well-behaved function. With this particular transform the critical isochore is represented by 8 =0, the critical isotherm by I9 = I/W2, and the coexistence curve by 8 = 1.

Schofieldf Department of Physics and Center for Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts (Received 2 January 1969) A parametric representation of the usual thermodynamic variables in the neighbor- hood of a critical point is proposed in terms of new variables r and 0. The representa- tion is chosen so that the \"scaling-law\" behavior is entirely contained in the r depen- dence, the 0 dependence being free of critical singularities. Preliminary calculations show that the 0 dependence may be chosen to have a rather simple form both in a ferro- magnet and in fluids. It is now widely accepted (though not theoreti- cally established) that Widom's hypothesist that the free energy of a ferromagnet or a fluid in the neighborhood of its critical point can be expressed as a homogeneous function of two of the thermo- dynamic variables, is essentially correct. In this Letter we propose a parametric representa- tion of the thermodynamic behavior which auto- matically satisfies the so-called \"scaling-law'\" relations, which follow from the hypothesis of homogeneity. Let T be the temperature measured from Tc as zero, let H be the magnetic field in the mag- netic case and represent the chemical potential difference (p-p, c) in the fluid, and let M be the magnetization (magnet) and density deviation (n -nc) (fluid). We consider the thermodynamic po- tential w(H, T) defined by w(H, T) =HM(H, T) F(M,T)- +F(0, 0)-S T (ma, gnet) (1) C =P(H, T) PnH ST (fl-uid-), - C C C where I\" is the free energy, P the pressure, and S the entropy. Then M is given by (&w/sH)T and (S-Sq) by (sw/sT)H. The transformation we suggest arises from the knowledge' that w(H, T) is a well behaved function of H for a given T and the plausible assumption that it is also a mell behaved function of T away from the coexistence curve, H =0, T(0. Thus we expect w(H, T) to be well behaved along any contour leading from one side of the coexistence curve to the other. This suggests that if we transform to variables r, which gives a measure of the distance of a point (H, T) from the critical point, and 0, which measures the distance along a contour of constant r, then the singular behav- ior at the critical point should be determined by the behavior as r —0 and that the thermodynamic functions should be well behaved in (9.
