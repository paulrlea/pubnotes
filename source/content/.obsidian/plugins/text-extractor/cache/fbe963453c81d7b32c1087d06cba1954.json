{"path":"Notes/@Fall2024/Biotech/Readings/MC4 Health Insurance.pdf","text":"Market for Health Insurance Main Items • Understanding health insurance mechanisms (in US and in parts of Europe) will be critical to understanding the three modules we will cover (listed in the syllabus). • We will focus on two main items in these slides • Why people buy health insurance and related issues (slides 12-23) • Data on heath insurance, affordability, and pharmaceuticals (this material is mainly in slides 27-34 in the end) • Quite a bit of the materials are in the form of general overview and brief description of the U.S. health insurance system. We will briefly go over some of them. You should take a look at these materials yourself. • We will blend various insurance issues with biopharma items in the specialized modules Development of Health InsuranceMarket for Health Insurance • A health insurance crisis? • The percentage of population without insurance stayed roughly the same over many years at 15-16% of the population • ACA reform expanded coverage (approx. numbers) • 2013: 13.3% uninsured • 2015: 9.1% • 2017: 8.5% • 2019: 8.0% • 2021: 8.3% Market for Health InsuranceMarket for Health Insurance Source: https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html Effect of ACA Interesting observations? Market for Health Insurance Percent of non-elderly uninsured by ageTypes of Health Insurance • Public/Social Insurance • Medicaid (lower income, and eligibility) • Medicare (age 65+, and eligibility) • Commercial • Employer based mechanisms • Blue Cross, Aetna, United Health, etc. • HMOs, PPO, etc. • What an individual may buy (e.g., if self-employed) • Companies above offer such plans Health Insurance Providers • Commercial insurance carriers • Managed care organizations • About 90% of civilian population under 65 has hospital or surgical insurance, or both • About 65%-70% of Medicare recipients (age 65 or older) carry supplemental coverage • Currently just under 10% of population is uninsured • Earlier it was as high as 16-18% Private Insurance Demand • Traditional indemnity insurance contracts • Term life insurance, Property-casualty • Health insurance similar to these • Early policies paid a specific amount for a broken leg or severed limb!! • But problems in applying concept to health • Verification of seriousness of health event • Wide variation in cost of treatment • Led to development of service-benefit policy, which covers billed expenses Theory of Risk and Insurance • People enter into insurance contracts to share the uncertainty of financial risk • When combined in a large enough group, the probability that someone in the group will become ill can be systematically estimated • Attitudes toward risk shown by a diminishing marginal utility of income, measuring the rate of change of the total utility of income Health Insurance and Market Failure • Dominant feature is reliance on third-party payment • Emergence of health insurance as an employment-based, tax- free benefit has expanded coverage to medical services that normally would not be covered if insurance were purchased individually • Result: A strong incentive for overconsumption • Providers have less incentive to provide care efficiently, which limits competition, raises costs, and lowers the quality of services Information Problems • Most challenging problems that arise because of costly information are due to unequal access to information • Several issues arise when information not distributed equally • Consumer information problems • Moral hazard • Adverse selection Consumer Information Problems • For a market to work, consumers must behave rationally, have income to spend, and know their own preferences • When they have trouble gathering and understanding information, their ability to make informed decisions is compromised • Quality of information in health care markets is poor, difficult to understand • Decision making requires that consumers know the prices paid for the products and services they buy Economics of Moral Hazard • Moral hazard occurs anytime there is an opportunity to gain from acting differently from the implied principles of a contract • Because private actions are hidden from view, both parties have an opportunity to gain from unpredictable behavior • If a consumer has health insurance: • Increase in the likelihood of purchasing potentially unnecessary medical services • Induces overconsumption in general • Induces higher spending in the event of illness Moral Hazard and Demand for Medical Care We will do a variant of this in class with details. Economics of Adverse Selection • Adverse Selection arises because people have more information about expected medical expenditures than insurance companies may, and find ways to try and conceal it • Insurer may have difficulty identifying prospective risk and charging premiums that reflect risk • Too many high-risk users in insured pool results in an unrepresentative risk-pool • This causes health insurance premiums rise • Part of reason why insurance premiums trended up after ACA • Low-risk users may drop out to seek cheaper coverage, or go uninsured if given choice Insurers’ Response to Information Problems • Deductibles (consumer must pay $1,000-$6,350 before coverage begins) • Coinsurance (consumer pays 10-20% of each claim) • Insurer’s response to adverse selection • Underwrite only prospective risk (not pre-existing conditions) • Refuse to insure known ailments • ACA allowed individuals with existing risk to be insured • Part of reason why ACA resulted in higher premiums Optimal Insurance Plan • Balances the benefits of greater risk sharing with the costs of moral hazard • Make people responsible for more of their own care • Requires higher deductibles and larger copays • E.g.: higher copays for more expensive biopharma • Pools high-risk people into pools with other high-risk people, and charges premiums to reflect that risk • But this is not allowed in group/employer-based policies • ACA eliminated much of this Medical Care for the Uninsured • Recent estimates of number of uninsured Americans • Between 25-30 million • Most are working poor and their dependents • Prior to passage of ACA, many earned too much to qualify for Medicaid • 2014: Rule change standardized Medicaid eligibility to include those who make less than 138% of the federal poverty level • 2020: Federal poverty level approx. $26,500. Medical Care for the Uninsured – NYS NYS Medicaid website https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1637 Individuals without Health Insurance Interesting observations? Safety Net for the Uninsured • Since 1985, it has been illegal for a hospital emergency department to deny care to anyone requesting it • The hospital must provide medically appropriate screening, and then treat or “stabilize” and transfer to a facility can treat • Most of this care is financed from Medicaid subsidies, or Medicare, or local municipal budgets • Universal coverage requires accepting the principles of subsidization Health Insurance, Costs, and Pharma Data • In the slides that follow I have added data that help understand some of the issues related to overall affordability, and challenges with biopharmaceuticals Health Data: Insurance Source: https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2022-summary-of-findings/attachment/figure-c-34/ Health Data: InsuranceHealth Data: Inefficiencies and Pharma https://social.eyeforpharma.com/commercial/cost-conundrum-pharmas-role-us- healthcare-infographic Perspective on potential inefficiencies and scope for improvement Health Data: Pharma Profit Margins https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs- supplements/info-2017/rx-prescription-drug- pricing.html Health Data: Pharma Costs https://blog.transparentrx.co m/2016/02/employers-take- aim-to-curb-high-cost- of.html Pharmacy is 20% of employer- sponsored medical benefits.
