(Y ou will have two equations.) ψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx) where x = ± L 2 = 0 ψ (− L 2 ) = A sin (k (− L 2 )) + B cos (k (− L 2 )) = 0 You can rewrite sin(−x) as − sin(x) and cos(−x) as cos(x) Adding and taking the dif ference of these two above functions 1 & 2 1. We will deduce the form of the solutions for a potential that is symmetric about x=0, that is, the potential is zero for -L/2<x<L/2 and infinite for |x|>L/2 ψ ( L 2 ) = A sin (k ( L 2 )) + B cos (k ( L 2 )) = 0 (1) −A sin (k ( L 2 )) + B (cos (k ( L 2 ))) = 0 (2) 1) + 2) = B cos (k ( L 2 )) = 0 1) − 2) = 0 = 2A sin (k ( L 2 )) c) What can you conclude about the allowed values of k for sin(kx) solutions and cos(kx) solutions? For sin(kx) k = nπ L  where n is an even integer For cos(kx) k = nπ L  where n is an odd integer d) What is the functional form of the ground state (longest wavelength) wavefunction for this well? For ground state n = 1 k = π L ψ1 = B cos ( πx L ) ignore scale on above graph i couldnt figure out how to be rid of them e) What is the wavefunction for the first excited state wavefunction for this well? k = 2π L ψ2 = A sin ( 2πx L ) ignore scale on above graph i couldnt figure out how to be rid of them","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
