Remember our solution to the angular term produced 𝐿𝑜𝑝 2 Ψ = 𝑙 𝑙 + 1 ℏ2Ψ, or 𝐿 = 𝑙 𝑙 + 1 ℏ From which we know that the the magnitude of the angular momentum is quantized. 4 Quantum Angular Momentum It can be shown that 𝐿𝑜𝑝 2 , 𝐿𝑧,𝑜𝑝 = 0, therefore it is possible to simultaneously find eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum and the z-component of the angular momentum.

If a particle of charge q, mass m and speed v circulates with radius r, it forms a current loop with average current 𝐼 = 𝑞/𝑇 where 𝑇 = 2𝜋𝑟/𝑣 . The magnetic moment of a current loop is 𝜇 = 𝐼𝐴, so 𝜇 = 𝑞𝑣 2𝜋𝑟 𝜋𝑟2 = 𝑞𝑣𝑟 2 . But wait, we also know that 𝐿 = Ԧ𝑟 × Ԧ𝑝 = 𝑚𝑟𝑣 ෠𝐿 so Ԧ𝜇 = 𝑞 2𝑚 𝐿 6 State Energy in a Magnetic Field If a system with a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, the energy of interaction will be: −𝜇 ∙ 𝐵 = − 𝑞 2𝑚 𝐿 ∙ 𝐵 so for a field along the z axis a term will be added to the Hamiltonian: 𝐻𝐵 ∼ 𝑞𝐵 2𝑚 𝐿𝑧,𝑜𝑝 The energy of the eigenfunction is therefore expected to shift by: Δ𝐸𝐵 = 𝑞𝐵 2𝑚 𝑚𝑙ℏ = 𝜇𝐵𝐵𝑚𝑙 where 𝜇𝐵 = 𝑒ℏ 2𝑚 ≈ 5.79 × 10−5 eV/T is called the Bohr magneton. 7 Zeeman Effect The energy of a magnetic dipole assumes discrete energies associated with the magnetic moment. Δ𝐸𝐵 = − Ԧ𝜇 ∙ 𝐵 = −𝜇𝐿,𝑧𝐵 = −𝑚𝑙𝜇𝐵𝐵 Where 𝜇𝐵 = 𝑒ℏ 2𝑚𝑒 = 5.8 × 10−5 𝑒𝑉 𝑇 8 For B=1 T (strong!) Δ𝐸~10−4 𝑒𝑉 And Δ𝜆 𝜆 = 𝜆2 ℎ𝑐 Δ𝐸~0.03 𝑛𝑚 out of about 600 nm for a typical optical transition. (This is a hard experiment, and Zeeman did it with a much weaker field in the 1890’s. He shared the 1902 Nobel prize for his spectroscopic work.) Anomalous Zeeman Effect • Our theory so far predicts that a magnetic field will split a spectral line into an odd number of shifted lines. • Instead, Zeeman observed this: 9 The theory is missing something. The anomalous Zeeman effect in sodium. (Top) The so-called sodium D-lines, a close-lying doublet of wavelengths 589.0 and 589.6 nm in the absence of a magnetic field. (Bottom) Splitting of the lines into six and four components in a magnetic field. This image was photographed by Pieter Zeeman in 1897. The Stern-Gerlach Experiment • The Stern-Gerlach experiment enables the separation of atoms in a beam into different magnetic dipole moments. • A uniform magnetic field exerts a torque on a dipole, but no net translational force. • A dipole in a non-uniform field experiences a net force. 1011 Dipole (N and S poles) at different locations in a non−uniform field 𝐵𝑧(𝑁) = 𝐵𝑧0 + 𝑧0 𝜕𝐵𝑧 𝜕𝑧 and 𝐵𝑧(𝑆) = 𝐵𝑧0 − 𝑧0 𝜕𝐵𝑧 𝜕𝑧 Assigning pole strengths ± 𝑔0 to the dipole, 𝐹𝑧 ≅ 𝑔0 𝐵𝑧(𝑁) − 𝐵𝑧(𝑆) = 2𝑔0𝑧0 𝜕𝐵𝑧 𝜕𝑧 = 𝜇𝑧 𝜕𝐵𝑧 𝜕𝑧 12 For a force 𝐹𝑧 = 𝜇𝑧 𝜕𝐵𝑧 𝜕𝑧 , we can estimate the deflection of the beam Δz after it passes along the length of the magnet gap. Δ𝑧 = 1 2 𝑎𝑧𝑡2 with 𝑎𝑧 = 𝜇𝑧 𝑀 𝜕𝐵𝑧 𝜕𝑧 and 𝑡 = 𝑥 𝑣𝑥 and estimating 𝑣𝑥 = 3𝑘𝐵𝑇 𝑀 Δ𝑧 = 1 2 𝜇𝑧 𝜕𝐵𝑧 𝜕𝑧 𝑥2 6𝑘𝐵𝑇 13 The Stern-Gerlach Experiment: Observation Theory so far predicts that Ag atoms passing perpendicular to a B field gradient will not be deflected. They are deflected into two lines. From deflection magnitude and Zeeman spectra: 𝜇𝑒 ≈ 𝜇𝐵 No B field B field 14 Pauli proposed that the observed experimental structure could arise if the a new two-valued degree of freedom could be assigned to the electron itself. Maybe the electron is spinning. Imagine a ball of spinning charge: Classical radius: 𝑟𝑒 = 𝑞2 𝜖0𝑚𝑒𝑐2 If we use the classical radius, we find that the edge of the electron must spin at 10x the speed of light. A full quantum theory is required. 15 Electron Magnetic Moment The observed splittings imply that the electron has a magnetic moment. A new spin quantum number mS was proposed to explain the experiments. The intrinsic spin angular momentum is Ԧ𝑆 where Ԧ𝑆 = 𝑠 𝑠 + 1 ℏ and 𝑆𝑧 = 𝑚𝑠ℏ and 𝑚𝑠 = −𝑠, … , 𝑠 in integer steps (2s + 1 allowed values) mS must be two-valued (Stern-Gerlach Exp.) and does not appear to have a term with 𝜇=0, so it was proposed that s = 1/2 and mS = -1/2 or + 1/2 Two independent indices ml and mS are used to specify states according to the z component of L and S. 16 Electron Spin Magnetic Moment The electron magnetic moment can be found from the splittings, but also can be derived from first principles (too hard for this course). Ԧ𝜇𝑠 = − 𝑞𝑒 𝑚 Ԧ𝑆 (Note that this relation differs by a factor of two from the angular momentum – moment relation.) Δ𝐸 = −𝜇𝑠 ∙ 𝐵 = −𝜇𝑠𝑧𝐵 • We can describe the possible electronic states of an electron in hydrogen by listing the quantum numbers (n, l, ml, ms), where – ml (ms) is the projection of L (S) on the z axis. – ml<(l(l+1))1/2 and ms=+ or – ½. • Spectroscopic notation was developed before quantum numbers were understood and described the appearance of some spectral lines. • The levels with n=1, 2, 3, 4 are listed with that number since it is a good measure of the transition energies. • The angular momentum quantum number is specified using s, p, d, f, g for l=0, 1, 2, 3, 4. (s=sharp, p=principal, d=diffuse, f=fundamental, g and h are notes to follow f.) 17 Quantum State and Optical Terminology • We now have two sources of magnetic moment and consequent energy shift. • We are tempted to think that they are just two effects that are independent of one another, but no, it is more complicated. • The two magnetic moments are coupled. (Orbital angular momentum creates a magnetic field that defines a z-direction for the spin moment (and vice versa).) • Because 𝐿 and Ԧ𝑆 are coupled, they interact with an external magnetic field in such a way that the total angular momentum: Ԧ𝐽 = 𝐿 + Ԧ𝑆 is a conserved quantity 18 Total angular momentumFine Structure • The spin of the electron also gives rise to energy splitting of lines due to the magnetic field induced by the angular momentum of the proton around the electron. 19 • The magnetic field due to the orbiting proton can be estimated semi- classically. 𝐵 = 𝜇0𝑖 2𝑟 ~ 𝜇0 2𝑟 𝑒𝑣 2𝜋𝑟 And taking 𝑚𝑣𝑟 = 𝐿 = 𝑛ℏ (where n is the primary quantum number) Δ𝐸 = 2𝜇𝐵𝐵~𝜇0𝑚𝑒8/(256𝜋4𝜖0 3ℏ4𝑛5) Δ𝐸 ≅ 𝑚𝑐2𝛼4/𝑛5 ≈ 10−5𝑒𝑉 Where 𝛼 = 𝑒2/4𝜋𝜖0ℏ𝑐=1/137. Total angular momentum The total angular momentum (J) is the vector sum of the orbital and electron angular momenta (spin). Ԧ𝐽 = 𝐿 + Ԧ𝑆 The total angular momentum is conserved in all interactions (and not necessarily L or S individually). The total angular momentum has the value: |𝐽| = 𝑗(𝑗 + 1)ℏ with possible values j = 𝑙 − 𝑠 , 𝑙 − 𝑠 + 1, 𝑙 − 𝑠 + 2, . . . 𝑙 + 𝑠 and with 𝑗𝑧 = 𝑚𝑧ℏ 20 Spectroscopic notation In spectroscopic notation we label the value of the total angular momentum quantum number j with a subscript following the letter code for orbital angular momentum. As an example: The notation 3p3/2 denotes a single electron in the n=3, l=1, j=3/2 state. Spectroscopic notation can also be used to describe the state of an atom with more than one electron. The angular momentum and spin are the sum for all the electrons in the system. As an example: The notation 3P1/2 can denote a sodium atom with its electron in the n=3, l=1, j=1/2 state. The electrons in the filled shells are paired off in such a way that the total angular momentum and spin are zero. 21 Spectroscopic notation example What is the total angular momentum and its z- component for an electron in the ground state of hydrogen? And what is its spectroscopic notation? 𝑙 = 0, 𝑠 = 1/2 so 𝑗 can only have the value 𝑗 = 𝑙 + 𝑠 = 1/2 and therefore 𝑚𝑗 = +1/2 or −1/2. The spectroscopic notation is thus 1𝑠1/2 The total angular momentum is |J|= 𝑗(𝑗 + 1)ℏ = 3 2 ℏ 22 Example 2 What are the possible values for the total angular momentum for an electron in an n=4, p state? 𝑙 = 1 and 𝑠 = 1/2 so 𝑗=3/2 or 1/2 and 𝐽 = 1 2 1 2 + 1 ℏ = 3 2 ℏ with 𝐽𝑧 = ±1/2 or 𝐽 = 3 2 3 2 + 1 ℏ = 15 2 ℏ with 𝐽𝑧 = ± 3 2 , ± 1 2 Spectroscopic notation is therefore: 4p1/2 or 4p3/2 23 Summary • Orbital angular momentum gives rise to an orbital magnetic moment – The energy shift of states due to magnetic moment interaction with external field is observed as the Zeeman effect • Electron spin also gives rise to a magnetic moment – Evidence for electron spin of ½ unit is found from the Anomalous Zeeman and Stern-Gerlach experiments (even splittings) – Fine structure spectroscopic energy shifts indicate that the spin and orbital magnetic moments interact with one another. • The total spin and orbital angular momentum couple to one another so that the total angular momentum Ԧ𝐽 = 𝐿 + Ԧ𝑆, with |𝐽| = 𝑗(𝑗 + 1)ℏ with possible values j = 𝑙 − 𝑠 , 𝑙 − 𝑠 + 1, 𝑙 − 𝑠 + 2, . . . 𝑙 + 𝑠 and with 𝑗𝑧 = 𝑚𝑧ℏ. • Spectroscopic Notation 24","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
