IMPORTANT NOTE: Only 2 of these problems will be graded for credit (at 10 points each)!! We will not disclose which problems are being graded before the deadline. This means that you will need to submit completed answers to all questions or risk getting a 0 if we grade a problem you didn’t do. 1. Calculate the differential scattering cross section d d )( and the total cross section t for the elastic scattering of a particle from an impenetrable sphere, the potential is given by 0)( =rU for r > a and =)(rU for r ≤ a, where a is the radius of the sphere. The total scattering cross section is    = d d d t )(  2. The effective gravitational acceleration measured at the surface of the Earth is the superposition of gravity and centrifugal acceleration: 𝑔⃗𝑒𝑓𝑓 = (𝑔⃗ − 𝜔⃗⃗⃗ × (𝜔⃗⃗⃗ × 𝑟⃗)) [do not just assume that g  = 9.81, calculate it out at each position from weight and Newton’s law of gravitation.] For your calculations, use the given constants at the end of the problem statement. Calculate the effective gravitational accelerations at (a) the North Pole, and (b) the Equator. (c) If a long jumper can jump 9m at the North Pole, how far can the athlete jump at the equator? Ignore wind resistance, temperature and a runway made of ice. Assume that the long jumper lifts off under an angle of 45°. (do not include the Coriolis effect in your calculations) [Rp = 6356.7523 km, Re = 6378.1370 km, M = 5.972 x 1024 kg, ω = 7.2921159 x 10-5 rad/s, G = 6.67408 x 10-11 m 3/(kg s 2)] [Problem 3 on next page] 3. a) Define a coordinate system on the Earth at a colatitude of θ (The angle measured down from the North pole to the point on the Earth). The coordinate system origin at this point on Earth is oriented such that z is pointed radially outward along the radius of Earth, y is pointed to the North, and x is pointed to the East. Draw a picture of this coordinate system. b) Take the velocity of the object to be given in the form ),,( zyxr  = . The Earth rotates at some constant angular velocity ω pointed “up” along the axis of rotation. [This means that ω is not directed exactly along any of the coordinate defined in (a)] Assume that the object only moves under the influence of gravity and the Coriolis Force. Using equation (10.34) from your textbook with S = 0, SHOW that the general expression for the x, y, and z accelerations for an object just above the surface of the Earth are of the form: 𝑥̈ = 2𝜔(𝑦̇ 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 − 𝑧̇𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃) 𝑦̈ = −2𝜔𝑥̇ 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 𝑧̈ = −𝑔 + 2𝜔𝑥̇ 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 c) We will now make a zeroth order approximation where ω = 0 (as if there isn’t any rotation of the Earth). Assume that the object is thrown with some initial velocity ),,( 0000 zyx vvvv =  . Using the initial condition and the zeroth order approximation for the accelerations from part (b), find the velocities 𝑥̇, 𝑦̇ , 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑧̇. Plug these velocity equations into the general accelerations from part (b). d) Now we explore the specific case of a ball thrown vertically upward (+z) with an initial speed v0 from a point on the ground at colatitude of θ [Assume that the ball is thrown from the origin of your coordinate system (0,0,0)]. Change the general expression from part (c) by setting the initial velocity in x and y to 0. Now integrate the accelerations found at the end of part (c), with the initial conditions, to find the deflection from the Coriolis Force in the x and y direction when the ball hits the ground. [Hint: use the z expression to find the time when the ball will return to the ground and plug it into the x and y expressions.]","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
