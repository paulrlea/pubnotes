In one dimension, the probability of finding the particle between x1 and x2 is ׬𝑥1 𝑥2 Ψ∗Ψ𝑑𝑥. • The product of the wavefunction with itself Ψ∗Ψ is called the probability density. 2 Connection between wave and particle parameters • Momentum-Wavelength: – 𝜆 = ℎ/𝑝; 𝑝 = ℏ𝑘 • Energy – Wave frequency: – 𝐸 = ℏ𝜔 • Energy – Momentum – Classical kinetic energy: 𝑇 = 𝑝2/2𝑚 – 𝑇 = 𝐸 − 𝐸0 = 𝑝2𝑐2 + 𝑚𝑐2 2 − 𝑚𝑐2 3 Working with wavefunctions • Physical rules – Normalizable – Continuity – “Smoothity” – Single valued • Consequences – Conservation rule: 𝜕 Ψ 2 𝜕𝑡 + ∇ ∙ Ԧ𝑗 = 0 – 𝑗𝑥 = Ψ∗ 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑥 − Ψ 𝜕Ψ∗ 𝜕𝑥 (probability current) 4 Wavepackets and Transforms • We can construct a free wavepacket with spatial envelope 𝜓(𝑥) from traveling wave eigenfunctions. 𝜓 𝑥 = 1 2𝜋 ׬ 𝐴 𝑘 𝑒𝑖𝑘𝑥𝑑𝑘 with 𝐴 𝑘 = 1 2𝜋 ׬ 𝜓 𝑥 𝑒−𝑖𝑘𝑥𝑑𝑥 – Note that this transform pair leads to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle 5 Averages and expectation values • The average value of an observable 𝑞 can be computed from the wavefunction: 𝑞 = ׬ Ψ∗𝑞𝑜𝑝Ψ𝑑𝑥 The operator for position is 𝑥𝑜𝑝 Momentum: 𝑝𝑜𝑝 = −𝑖ℏ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Kinetic energy: 𝑇𝑜𝑝 = 𝑝𝑜𝑝 2 2𝑚 = − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 6 Orthogonality and Completeness All physical solutions to the SE can be composed as a sum of eigenfunctions Ψ 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝑐1Ψ1 + 𝑐2Ψ2 + ⋯ • The probability of observing Ψ in state Ψ1 is 𝑐1 2. – 𝑐1(0) = ׬ Ψ1 ∗Ψ𝑑𝑥 – 1 = Σ𝑛 𝑐𝑛 2 78 Linearity and Superposition If there exist two distinct state functions of a system with Hamiltonian H, then for arbitrary constants c1 and c2 the linear combination c1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝜓2 also satisfies the TDSE: ෡𝐻 − ෠𝐸 𝑐1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝜓2 = 𝑐1 ෡𝐻 − ෠𝐸 𝜓1 + 𝑐2 ෡𝐻 − ෠𝐸 𝜓2 = 0 An arbitrary linear combination represents a quantum state of the system. This property of an operator is known as linearity. 9 Operators – Operators must act on a function – Operators act on every function to their right unless their action is constrained by brackets – The product of operators implies successive operation (starting with the rightmost). – The sequence of operations does not necessarily commute. – addition or subtration of operators means to distribute the operations 10 Operators and Eigenvalues In quantum physics, the form of the eigenvalue equation for an observable መ𝐴 with eigenstate 𝜓𝑎 and eigenvalue 𝑎 is: መ𝐴𝜓𝑎 = 𝑎𝜓. The collection of all eigenvalues is called the spectrum of this operator. The most familiar eigenstate is the stationary state. Ψ𝐸 = 𝜓𝐸𝑒−𝑖𝐸𝑡/ℏ which satisfies: ෡𝐻Ψ = 𝐸Ψ In an eigenstate of an observable, the uncertainty in that observable is zero. 11 Hermitian Operators/Hermiticity ෠𝑄 is Hermitian if for any two physically admissible state functions: නΨ1 ∗ ෠𝑄Ψ2𝑑𝑥 = න(෡Q∗Ψ1 ∗)Ψ2𝑑𝑥 If an operator is Hermitian, the expectation value of that operator will be real. All operators for physically measurable quantities are Hermitian. 12 Hermiticity: Real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenfunctions • The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real. • The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are the only values that we can observe in a measurement of that observable. AND The eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator are orthogonal, constitute a complete set, and satisfy closure. 13 Dirac braket notation Dirac Notation − \"bra\"= \"ket\"= 𝑄 = ȁΨ1 ෠𝑄Ψ1 = න 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒 Ψ1∗ ෠𝑄Ψ1𝑑𝑥 =expectation value ȁΨ1 ෠𝑄Ψ2 = න 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒 Ψ1∗ ෠𝑄Ψ2𝑑𝑥 =matrix element ȁΨ1 Ψ1 = න 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒 Ψ1∗Ψ2𝑑𝑥 =overlap integral 1) Take the complex conjugate of the function inside the 2) Act with the operator on the function to its right. 3) Integrate the integrand over all space. It can be tiresome to write the same integrals repeatedly. Dirac notation saves some ink, and provides conceptual flexibility. 14 Operator Example The Parity Operator: ෡Π What are its properties? Definition ෡Π𝑓( Ԧ𝑟) = 𝑓(− Ԧ𝑟) ෡Π𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑥) = 𝑓(−𝑥, −𝑦, −𝑧) ෡𝜫 is linear ෡Π 𝑐1𝑓1(𝑥) + 𝑐2𝑓2(𝑥) = 𝑐1𝑓1(−𝑥) + 𝑐2𝑓2(−𝑥) = 𝑐1 ෡Π𝑓1(𝑥) + 𝑐2 ෡Π𝑓2(𝑥) 15 ෡𝜫 is Hermitian න𝜓1 ∗(𝑥) ෡Π𝜓2(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = න ෡Π𝜓1(𝑥) ∗ 𝜓2(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥? Working on the LHS: න𝜓1 ∗(𝑥) ෡Π𝜓2(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = න𝜓1 ∗(𝑥) 𝜓2(−𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 change the dummy variable of integration න −∞ ∞ 𝜓1 ∗(𝑥) 𝜓2(−𝑥)𝑑𝑥 = න ∞ −∞ 𝜓1 ∗(−𝑥) 𝜓2(𝑥)𝑑(−𝑥) = − න ∞ −∞ ෡Π𝜓1(𝑥) ∗ 𝜓2(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 = න −∞ ∞ ෡Π𝜓1(𝑥) ∗ 𝜓2(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 And since it is Hermitian it’s eigenfunctions must form a complete, orthogonal set. – Let’s check. 16 Physical meaning of expansions • The collection of expansion coefficients in a state function is merely an alternate way to represent this physical state. They contain the same information as the state function itself. • The expansion coefficients may be useful. – The wave function explicitly shows the dependence of the state function on space and time. If we are interested in another property, such as energy, it may be more informative to represent the state function in terms of energy eigenstates. – The coefficients cq are properly called, the probability amplitudes for the observable Q. – Knowledge of the probability of a certain outcome may provide physical insight into the situation. Commuting Operators • The commutator is the combination of two operators in which the difference is taken between the operations performed in different order: Commutator≡ 𝐴𝑜𝑝, 𝐵𝑜𝑝 = (𝐴𝑜𝑝𝐵𝑜𝑝 − 𝐵𝑜𝑝𝐴𝑜𝑝) • Whether two operators commute or not can tell us a lot about the nature of the eigenfunctions of the operators without even solving the Schrodinger equation. 17 Information from the Commutator • A complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of two Hermitian operators exists iff the operators commute. • If two operators do not commute and their commutator can be expressed as 𝐴𝑜𝑝, 𝐵𝑜𝑝 = 𝑖𝐶𝑜𝑝 where 𝐶𝑜𝑝 is a Hermitian operator, then an uncertainty relation of the form Δ𝐴Δ𝐵 ≥ 𝐶 2 must hold. 18 Uncertainty • The uncertainty of an arbitrary observable is given by: Δ𝐴 = 𝐴 − 𝐴 2 = 𝐴 − 𝐴 2 • If many measurements are analyzed, then Δ𝐴 is the standard deviation of the measurements. • The variance is defined as Δ𝐴 2 = 𝐴2 − 𝐴 2 • If we define 𝑈𝑜𝑝 = 𝐴𝑜𝑝 − 𝐴 , then න𝜓∗𝑈𝑜𝑝 2 𝜓𝑑𝑥 = Δ𝐴 2 19 Spin Matrices 2 Let’s find the matrix for 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 . We know that a particle in a spin up state satisfies: 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 𝜒+ = 𝑠 𝑠 + 1 ℏ2𝜒+ = 3 4 ℏ2𝜒+ 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 𝜒− = 𝑠 𝑠 + 1 ℏ2𝜒− = 3 4 ℏ2𝜒− To find the eigenfunctions and values we write S2 as a matrix with unknown elements: 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 = 𝑒 𝑓 𝑔 ℎ So that 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 𝜒+ = 𝑒 𝑓 𝑔 ℎ 1 0 = 3 4 ℏ2 𝑒 𝑔 = 3 4 ℏ2 1 0 And thus 𝑒 𝑔 = 3 4 ℏ2 0 . Similarly, 𝑓 = 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑔 = 3 4 ℏ2 Spin 3 Putting the coefficients into the matrix representation: 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 = 3 4 ℏ 2 1 0 0 1 We can also deduce the operators for 𝑆𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑆𝑦. 𝑆𝑥 = ℏ 2 0 1 1 0 and 𝑆𝑦 = ℏ 2 0 −𝑖 𝑖 0 and using a standard notation:𝑆𝑥 = ℏ 2 𝜎𝑥 Where 𝜎𝑥 = 0 1 1 0 … The sigma’s are called the Pauli spin matrices.

Solutions for the Schrodinger equation curve toward the x-axis in classically allowed 𝐸 > 𝑉 regions and away from the axis in classically forbidden regions. 2. For bound states, the wavefunction must go to zero for large distances outside the well. (must be normalizable) 3. Curvature increases for larger 𝐸 − 𝑉(𝑥) . 4. Solutions are continuous and smooth if the potential has no infinite steps. 5. Energy eigenfunctions have an integer number of antinodes on classically allowed regions. 6. The wavefunction amplitude is usually larger in regions with small E>V. * From https:’’www.asc.ohio-state.edu/physics/ntg/H133/handouts/wavefunctions.pdf 26Quantum Physics 1 - Persans Bound state wavefunctions for symmetric potentials 27 Same rules: + • Ground state has one antinode, centered • Alternating odd and even functions.

This leads to the requirement that the eigenfunctions be either even or odd. 𝜓𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛(𝑥) = 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < − 𝑎 2 𝐵 cos 𝑘 𝑥 for − 𝑎 2 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 2 𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 > 𝑎 2 (Note that we set C=G.) 𝜓𝑜𝑑𝑑(𝑥) = 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < − 𝑎 2 𝐵 sin 𝑘𝑥 for − 𝑎 2 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 2 −𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 > 𝑎 2 (Note that we set C=-G.) Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 32 Now we use the physical properties of the wavefunction at the boundaries to find the constants B and C, and the energies. Considering the even solutions first: 1) The wavefunction must be continuous at the boundary at +a/2 and –a/2. For x=-a/2 and +a/2: 𝐵 cos 𝑘𝑎 2 = 𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑎 2 2) The derivative of the wavefunction must be continuous at the boundaries. For x=-a/2 and +a/2: 𝐵𝑘 sin 𝑘𝑎 2 = 𝐶𝐾𝑒−𝐾𝑎 2 Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 33 Even solutions: Plot both the left hand and right hand side of tan 𝜉 = 𝜉0 2−𝜉2 𝜉 as a function of 𝜉. • Intersections are allowed energies • tan 𝜉 goes to ∞ each time 𝜉 goes through odd 𝜋 2. • If well depth is small, then only one solution can be found. • If well depth is large, solutions approach infinite well. Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 34 • Summary of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues To be consistent with Appendix B1 in Townsend, we change variables to avoid writing constants repeatedly.

A Model Molecule We will use the Dirac Delta function as a simplified representation of an electron bound to an atom. We will address the case of an electron bound to a proton in a Coulomb potential later in this course. Consider two delta function potentials near one another. 42 2𝑚 ℏ2 𝑉 𝑥 = − 𝜆 𝑎 [𝛿 𝑥 − 𝑎 + 𝛿 𝑥 + 𝑎 ] Model Molecule Wavefunction Shape • We expect that the solution will look something like this:. 43 Model Molecule Wavefunction • Since 𝐸 < 𝑉 everywhere except for the two points a and –a, and the wavefunction must be normalizable, the solutions must be of the form: 𝜓 𝑥 = ൞ 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < −𝑎 𝐴 exp 𝐾𝑥 + 𝐵 exp −𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 − 𝑎 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 𝐷 exp −𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎 < 𝑥 • Where 𝐾 = 2𝑚 𝐸 ℏ2 • The lowest energy solution must be an even function, so C=D and A=B. 44 Model Wavefunction (2) Applying the symmetry conditions: 𝜓 𝑥 = ൞ 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < −𝑎 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 − 𝑎 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 𝐶 𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎 < 𝑥 Continuity at x=a yields: 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 = 𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑎 And the condition on the discontinuity in the derivative at x=a yields: −𝐾𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑎 − 𝐴𝐾 sinh 𝐾𝑎 = − 𝜆 𝑎 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 46 Putting the two conditions together: −𝐾𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 − 𝐴 sinh 𝐾𝑎 = − 𝜆 𝑎 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 And dividing by 𝐴 cosh 𝐾𝑎 tanh 𝐾𝑎 = 𝜆 𝑎 − 1 Which can be solved numerically. Here is a graphical representation to illustrate Where the dashed line is the energy for a single well. The particle has lower energy when bound to two wells near one another – binding. 47 The Step Potential • State general solutions in each region. • Carefully eliminate non-physical possibilities. • Match wavefunctions the boundary. – Two possibilities E>V and E<V. 0 U x x=0 E http://www.abdn.ac.uk/physics/vpl/qstep/index.html 48 An example • Let’s consider the situation where a wave is incident from the left onto a barrier at x=0. • The wavefunction for pure momentum wave moving left is: ( , ) ikx i tx t Ae −= • What can the wave do? • It can bounce back, going the other way. • It can pass through the boundary.

Quantum Physics Review 74 The energy of a magnetic dipole assumes discrete energies associated with the magnetic moment. Δ𝐸𝐵 = − Ԧ𝜇 ∙ 𝐵 = −𝜇𝐿,𝑧𝐵 = −𝑚𝑙𝜇𝐵𝐵 75 For B=1 T (strong!)

The theory of orbital angular momentum and magnetic moment is predicts small but measurable shifts in optical transition energies known as the Zeeman Effect. Quantum Angular Momentum It can be shown that 𝐿𝑜𝑝 2 , 𝐿𝑧,𝑜𝑝 = 0, therefore it is possible to simultaneously find eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum and the z- component of the angular momentum.

A new spin quantum number mS was proposed to explain the experiments. The intrinsic spin angular momentum is Ԧ𝑆 where Ԧ𝑆 = 𝑠 𝑠 + 1 ℏ and 𝑆𝑧 = 𝑚𝑠ℏ and 𝑚𝑠 = −𝑠, … , 𝑠 in integer steps (2s + 1 allowed values) mS must be two-valued (Stern-Gerlach Exp.) and does not appear to have a term with 𝜇=0, so it was proposed that s = 1/2 and mS = -1/2 or + 1/2 Two independent indices ml and mS are used to specify states according to the z component of L and S.Quantum Physics ReviewQuantum Physics Review 78 Electron Spin Magnetic Moment The electron magnetic moment can be found from the splittings, but also can be derived from first principles (too hard for this course). Ԧ𝜇𝑠 = − 𝑞𝑒 𝑚 Ԧ𝑆 (Note that this relation differs by a factor of two from the angular momentum – moment relation.) Δ𝐸 = −𝜇𝑠 ∙ 𝐵 = −𝜇𝑠𝑧𝐵 • We now have two sources of magnetic moment and consequent energy shift. • We are tempted to think that they are just two effects that are independent of one another, but no, it is more complicated. • The two magnetic moments are coupled. (Orbital angular momentum creates a magnetic field that defines a z-direction for the spin moment (and vice versa).) • Because 𝐿 and Ԧ𝑆 are coupled, they interact with an external magnetic field in such a way that the total angular momentum: Ԧ𝐽 = 𝐿 + Ԧ𝑆 is a conserved quantity Quantum Physics Review 79 Total angular momentumTotal angular momentum The total angular momentum (J) is the vector sum of the orbital and electron angular momenta (spin). Ԧ𝐽 = 𝐿 + Ԧ𝑆 The total angular momentum is conserved in all interactions (and not necessarily L or S individually). The total angular momentum has the value: ȁ𝐽ȁ = 𝑗(𝑗 + 1)ℏ with possible values j = 𝑙 − 𝑠 , 𝑙 − 𝑠 + 1, 𝑙 − 𝑠 + 2, . . . 𝑙 + 𝑠 and with 𝑗𝑧 = 𝑚𝑧ℏ 80 Spectroscopic notation In spectroscopic notation we label the value of the total angular momentum quantum number j with a subscript following the letter code for orbital angular momentum. As an example: The notation 3p3/2 denotes a single electron in the n=3, l=1, j=3/2 state. Spectroscopic notation can also be used to describe the state of an atom with more than one electron. The angular momentum and spin are the sum for all the electrons in the system. As an example: The notation 3P1/2 can denote a sodium atom with its electron in the n=3, l=1, j=1/2 state. The electrons in the filled shells are paired off in such a way that the total angular momentum and spin are zero. 81 Summary • Orbital angular momentum gives rise to an orbital magnetic moment – The energy shift of states due to magnetic moment interaction with external field is observed as the Zeeman effect • Electron spin also gives rise to a magnetic moment – Evidence for electron spin of ½ unit is found from the Anomalous Zeeman and Stern-Gerlach experiments (even splittings) – Fine structure spectroscopic energy shifts indicate that the spin and orbital magnetic moments interact with one another. • The total spin and orbital angular momentum couple to one another so that the total angular momentum Ԧ𝐽 = 𝐿 + Ԧ𝑆, with |𝐽ȁ = 𝑗(𝑗 + 1)ℏ with possible values j = 𝑙 − 𝑠 , 𝑙 − 𝑠 + 1, ȁ ȁ 𝑙 − 𝑠 + 2, . . . 𝑙 + 𝑠 and with 𝑗𝑧 = 𝑚𝑧ℏ. • Spectroscopic Notation Quantum Physics Review 82 Identical Particles • Wavefunctions of multiple particles must account for the fact that identical particles are indistinguishable. • Pauli Exclusion Principle: No two electrons in the same system can be in the same state. • These effects lead to profound changes in the physical world. • How does particle symmetry requirement affect properties of atoms? 83Identical Particles Constructing a probability density that does not change under particle exchange 84 Ψ𝑎 = 1 2 𝜓𝐴(𝑥1)𝜓𝐵(𝑥2) − 𝜓𝐴(𝑥2)𝜓𝐵(𝑥1) In the antisymmetric state, P is a maximum when the particles are far apart and is zero along the x1=x2 line.
