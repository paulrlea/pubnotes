You are given the following historical data on the quantity of money (X) and national income (Y )(both in million of dollars). Also assume Assumptions 1, 2, 3 hold and the variance is (conditional) homoskedasticity: Year Quantity of Money (X) National Income (Y ) 1989 2.0 5.0 1990 2.5 5.5 1991 3.2 6.0 1992 3.6 7.0 1993 3.3 7.2 1994 4.0 7.7 1995 4.2 8.4 1996 4.6 9.0 1997 4.8 9.7 1998 5.0 10.0 (a) Estimate the regression of national income Y on the quantity of money X and provide estimates of their standard errors assuming Assump- tions 1 to 4 hold. (Do this by HAND with a calculator and show your work). Answer: ˉY = 7.55 ∑ Yi = 75.5 ∑ Y 2 i = 597.03 ˉX = 3.72 ∑ Xi = 37.2 ∑ X 2 i = 147.18 ∑ XiYi = 295.95 n = 10 ˆβ1 = ∑ XiYi − n ˉX ˉY ∑ X 2 i − n ˉX 2 = 295.95 − 10 × 3.72 × 7.55 147.18 − 10 × 3.722 = 15.09 8.796 ≃ 1.7156 ˆβ0 = ˉY − ˆβ2 ˉX = 7.55 − 1.7156 × 3.72 ≃ 1.168 So the estimated equation is ˆYi = 1.168 + 1.7156Xi Since the error terms are conditionally homoskedastic (Assumption 4 holds), so the estimated standard errors of coefficients estimates are 1 given by s.e ( ˆβ0) = √ s2 n ∑ X 2 i ∑ √Xi − ˉX)2 = 0.4834 s.e ( ˆβ1) = √ s2 ∑ √Xi − ˉX)2 = 0.1260 s2 = ∑ ˆe2 i n − 2 = ∑ (Yi − ˆYi)2 n − 2 = ∑ (Yi − ˆβ1 − ˆβ2Xi)2 n − 2 = 0.1397 (b) How do you interpret the intercept and the slope of the regression line? Answer: The estimated intercept ˆβ0 says that if the quantity of money is zero, then the average national income will be 1.168 mil- lion dollars. But since there is no value of quantity of money is close to zero in the sample, indeed zero is outside of the sample range, so the above interpretation may be meaningless. And the estimate of intercept ˆβ1 means that the level of national income would increase by $1.716 million on average if the quantity of money increases by one million. (c) Test the significance of X at 5% significance level by assuming As- sumptions 1-4 are satisfied. Answer: H0 : β1 = 0 vs H1 : β1 ̸= 0 Under H0. t = ˆβ1 − β1 s.e.( ˆβ1) = ˆβ1 s.e.( ˆβ1) ∼ t8 Note the realized or actual t is given by tact = 1.7156 0.1260 = 13.62 and the critical value t8,0.025 = 2.306. Since |tact| > t8,0.025. we reject the null at 5% significance level based on the statistical evidence, and conclude that X (the quantity of money) is a significant factor in determining Y (the national income). Alternatively, we can do the p-value approach. Under H0, t ∼ t8 distribution, So p − value = P (|t| > |tact|) = 2P (t < −13.62) ≈ 0 since p−value < α = 0.05, we reject the null at 5% significance level. (d) If you had sole control over the money supply and wished to achieve a level of national income of 12.0 in 1999, at what level would you set the money supply? Explain. 2 Answer: According to the estimation results, we have the following average relationship. 12 = 1.168 + 1.7156X So, the quantity of money needed to obtain the given national income level in 1999 is $6.351 million. So, with this level of the quantity of money, we can get $12 million national income on average. But since the quantity of money of $6.351 million is outside the sample range, the prediction of national income of $12 million may not hold. (e) Compute the coefficient of determination R2. Answer: Since the estimated model contains a constant term (inter- cept β0), then R2 is defined and given by R2 = 1 − SSR T SS = 1 − ∑n i=1 ˆe2 i∑n i=1(Yi − ˉY )2 = 1 − (n − 2)s2 ∑n i=1 Y 2 i − n ˉY 2 = 1 − 8 × 0.1397 597.03 − 10 × 7.55 = 0.959 So 95.9% of the variation in Y (national income) is explained by X(the quantity of money ) in this simple regression model. (f ) Construct the 95% confidence interval for the parameter β1 (the co- efficient for X), how do you interpret this confidence interval? Answer: 95% confidence interval for the parameter β1 is given by [ ˆβ1 − tn−2, α 2 ∙ s.e.( ˆβ1), ˆβ1 + tn−2, α 2 ∙ s.e.( ˆβ1)] = [ ˆβ1 − t8,0.025 ∙ s.e.( ˆβ1), ˆβ1 + tn−2, α 2 ∙ s.e.( ˆβ1)] = [1.7156 − 2.306 × 0.126, 1.7156 + 2.306 × 0.126] = [1.425, 2.006] (Loose interpretation) We are 95% confident that the true β1 lies between 1.425 and 2.006. Note that it does NOT indicate that 95% of the sample values occur in that range [1.425, 2.006], Nor does it say that the probability of true β1 lies in the interval [1.425, 2.006] is 0.95 (actually the probability of true β1 lies in this interval is either 0 or 1). (Precise interpretation, not required) If one can take repeated samples from the population, estimate the equation using OLS and construct a confidence interval for each sample base on [ ˆβ1 − t8,0.025 ∙ s.e.( ˆβ1), ˆβ1 +tn−2, α 2 ∙s.e.( ˆβ1)], then 95% of these constructed intervals will contain the true β1. 3","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
