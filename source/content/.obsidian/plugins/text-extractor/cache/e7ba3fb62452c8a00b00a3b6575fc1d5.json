When do we use separation of variables in x, y, z (or 10 other coordinate systems) to solve 𝛻2V(r)=0? • There is excitement about knowing V(r) in a region of space which is free of electric charge, bounded by conducting surfaces and where the geometry of the problem is best described in Cartesian coordinates (or any of other 10 coordinate systems). • One exemplary area of application are “electrostatic lenses” used for managing accelerating electron beams in e.g. electron microscopes (TEM/SEM). Electrostatic lenses consist of conducting metal electrodes at electric potential for manipulation of electrons.
