Suppressing aggregation quenching aggregation quenching – formation of dimers and cofacial aggregates leading to level splitting which prevents radiative decay Solution: prevent close-packing of chromophores • by diluting with matrix substance (leads to phase separation) • by chemical design - change shape of molecules to reduce stacking - prevent phase separationPHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo 1a. Preventing stacking - polythiophenes P. Barta, et al. J. Appl. Phys. 84, 6279-6284 (1998) • large dihedral angles in HHTT configuration leads to lower crystallinity • 𝜂𝑃𝐿 increases in HHTTPHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo 1a. Preventing stacking - oligothiophenes • numbers are solid-state PL efficiency • packing dominated by O-H interaction (rather than π- stacking G. Gigli, R. Cingolani, G. Barbarella, L. Favaretto and F. Cacialli, Appl. Phys. Lett. 75, 439-441 (1999PHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo 1b. Optical device design • multiple layers with various refractive indices: • use intrinsic interference effects • enhance interference with mirrors • improve outcoupling • reduce waveguiding • create microcavities J.

Improving no. of radiative excitons • TTA (Triplet-Triplet Annihilation) • fusion of two triplets into a singlet (and other species): 𝑇1 + 𝑇1 → 𝑆𝑛 + 𝑆0 • mainly in anthracene derivatives • usually requires higher driving voltage • max theoretical PLQY: 62.5%, in practice <40% • TADF (Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence) • aka reverse ISC: triplet promoted to singlet • possible when kT comparable to Exchange Energy • max theoretical PLQE: 100% • HLCT (Hybrid Local Charge Transfer) • requires donor-acceptor molecule with similar triplet and singlet energies • creates coupled charge-transfer state (easy conversion) and local excited state (efficient and fast fluorescence) • max theoretical PLQY: 100%PHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo 2b. Harvesting phosphorescence - theoretical max PLQY 100% if assisted by ISC - use small molecular weight fluorescent host to decrease concentration quenching - 3 possible paths (Cleave at al.): - Foerster transfer of singlets from host + ISC - Dexter transfer of triplets from host - e-h capture directly in the guest emitter V. Cleave, et al. Adv. Mater. 11, 285 (1999) Issues: - usually high TTA in phosphorescent materials - difficult to find blue emitters - efficiency drop at large currents (saturation of emissive sites due to long lifetime) - Dexter transfer slow because of rangePHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo 2b. Transfer requirements Foerster transfer: • energy of host molecule > guest • spins of host and guest remain unchanged before and after transfer • emission spectrum of host overlaps with absorption spectrum of guest (transition coupling) Dexter transfer: • energy of host molecule > guest • total spin of electrons conserved • emission spectrum of host overlaps with absorption spectrum of guest (transition coupling) • orbital wave functions of host and guest overlapPHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo Overview of optimisation strategies 1.

Phys. 84, 6859 (1998)PHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo 3b. Balancing charge transport - reduce excess majority carriers (generally holes) - introduce separate electron and hole transporting layers - holes: aromatic triamines, carbazole compounds, organosilicons, organometals, etc. - electrons: planar aromatic compounds wth large conjugate structures, metal complexes (e.g. Alq3), oxadiazoles, perfluorinated materials, thiophene oligopolymers - formation of heterojunctions - increased efficiency and improved characteristics thanks to recombination at polymer- polymer junctions - possibility to control the position of recombination region (reduce electrode quenching) - increased driving voltage (additional barrier in the device) and reduction of operative lifetime - complex fabrication procedurePHAS0058, Lecture 2 Dr Monika Szumilo Progression of device structure Bauri J, Choudhary RB, Mandal G (2021) Recent advances in efficient emissive materials-based OLED applications: a review.
