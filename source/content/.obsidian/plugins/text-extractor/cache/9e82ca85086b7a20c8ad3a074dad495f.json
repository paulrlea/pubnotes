Radiation intensity is expected to follow the inverse square law and is thus proportional to , which can be observed by varying the distance from a detector to a radioactive source. By placing sheets of material between the source and detector , attenuation can be observed. Assuming that the sheets are composed of the same material, the transmission probability is given by , where is the total thickness of the material and is a material-dependent attenuation coef ficient. Furthermore, by scattering radiation from a target rod, Compton scattering can be observed, and the experimental dif ferential cross section can be measured. From these quantities, the mass and classical radius of an electron can be found. This data can also be parametrized for a rod of unknown material in order to assess its chemical composition. γ 1 r2 T = e−μx x μ P ro cedure This lab is split into four sections: inverse square law , attenuation, Compton scattering, and dif ferential cross section.

The data acquired in the lab was collected using a scintillation detector that was connected to a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The MCA readout sorts events into dif ferent channels, which correspond to a certain voltage signal. T o convert from channel number to energy , it is assumed that the channels follow a linear relationship with energy such that , where is the energy and is the channel number . To find the coef ficient , one must fit a spectrum with known photopeak energies to the channels. This is done by selecting photopeaks that correspond to -ray emissions of known energy and fitting Gaussians to the peaks to find their centroids: Fit function for Gaussian peak. represents the centroid of the peak.

To minimize background radiation from the Cs-137 source, the detector was aimed at a wall, 90 relative to the opening of the Cs-137 source (which was kept sealed for this section). Because the barium source was weakly radioactive, we prioritized measurements that were much closer to the detector rather than much farther away . Two methods were used to analyze the inverse square law data. In both cases, a Gaussian was fit to the photopeak with the highest amplitude. For the first method, the height of this peak was used to fit to a function , where and were free parameters. In the second method, the area was computed using the analytical form for the area under a Gaussian peak: In the equation above, is the error function. Again, these areas were fit to an arbitrary power function of . In both cases, the value of was compared to the expected value .

The transmission probability for an individual -ray can be expressed as a decaying exponential: Since depends on the material (and generally , the photon energy), it can be found by measuring the decrease in photopeak amplitude as a function of material thickness . Experimentally , this was accomplished by measuring the emission spectrum of Cs-137 while varying the number of copper sheets between the detector and the source. The largest photopeak was fit to a Gaussian, which provided the amplitude of each peak. Each amplitude was then divided by the amplitude of the zero sheet fit and correlated with a thickness (product of the number of sheets used and the thickness of one sheet). From this, an exponential fit was generated and the attenuation coef ficient of copper was found. (Note: there is a discontinuity between the theory document and instructions document where the former specified aluminum sheets while the latter specified copper sheets. W e used copper sheets to perform measurements in this section.) γ T = e−μx μ x S ectio n 3 : C o mp to n S catterin g Photons incident on a massive particle scatter with a new energy given by the Compton scattering equation: In this section, radiation from the Cs-137 source is incident on a rod of either aluminum or an \"unknown\" material (the material composition is not necessary for this section). By varying the detector angle , the photopeak corresponding to incident -rays with will shift. After fitting a Gaussian to this peak, the centroid is converted from channels to energy , and thus provides the shifted photon energy . Since photons are scattering from electrons in the rods, fitting this data to the Compton scattering equation will yield the mass of an electron.

The experimental dif ferential cross section is calculated as follows: is the integral of the shifted photopeak, which was calculated using the same method outlined in Section 1. is the detector ef ficiency , which is a function of energy: and is accurate to the hundreth. is the number of electron scatterers in the material and is given by , where is the material density , is the scattering volume, is Avogadro's number is the weight factor of an element, is its atomic number , and is its molar mass. is the solid angle of the detector , given by , where is the diameter of the scintillator (=5.08 cm) and is the distance from the center of the rod to the detector . is the photon flux at the rod, and there are two approaches to calculating it. Approach 1 uses the following equation: Here, is the activity of the Cs-137 source, is the fraction of decays that result in a photon with energy , and is the distance from the source to the center of the rod. Approach 2 assumes that the inverse square law holds and uses the flux present at the detector measured at 0 with no rod to compute the flux at the rod: Using both methods, the experimental cross section can be plotted as a function of a normalized calculated cross section by computing the cross section as a function of for . The resulting plot is expected to be linear with a slope of . For both approaches, this generates a linear fit that provides the classical radius of an electron. To identify the material of the second rod, the normalized calculated cross section is multiplied by the newly found radius of the electron. This is plotted against a manipulated experimental cross section, which is simply equal to the dif ferential cross section times . When plotted against the calculated theoretical cross section, the plot will again be linear; however , the slope will now be equal to . This is calculated for both approaches, then compared to several computed values for common machining materials, namely pure aluminum, pure copper , 6061 aluminum, 360 brass, and 304 stainless steel. = ( ) (1 + ) dσ dΩ r2 2 1 + θcos2 1 + α(1 − cos θ)2 (1 − cos θα2 )2 (1 + θ)(1 + α(1 − cos θ))cos2 r α = Eγ mc2 Eγ 661.7keV = dσ dΩ Σ′ γ IΔΩϵnθ Σ ′ γ ϵ ϵ = −0.5E(MeV ) + 0.58 nθ = ρV Σnθ NA wi Zi Mi ρ V NA wi Zi Mi ΔΩ ΔΩ = π(D/2)2 R2 2 D R2 I =I1 fA0 4πR2 1 = 10 mCiA0 f = 0.841 661.7 keV = 31 cmR1 ∘ = , = +Id A r2 d rd R1 R2 = , =Ir A r2 r rr R1 = =Ir Id r2 d r2 r Id ( +R1 R2)2 R2 1 θ r = 1 r2 nθ nθ nθ 4/12/2021 James_Drake_Section1_ComptonScattering file:///C:/Users/drakej3/Downloads/James_Drake_Section1_ComptonScattering (4).html 6 /16 A n alysis Un certain ty All counts were taken to have uncertainty of , where is the number of counts.

N −−√ N S ectio n 0 : C alibratio n In order to calibrate the MCA, we first measured three background measurements for each source (three facing the wall, three facing the Cs-137 source). These were averaged and subtracted from all future measurements. The spectra of Cs-137 and Ba-133 were obtained using the scintillation detector .

The energy for each channel is given by the following: Though the uncertainty in this coef ficient is low (relative error ), it could be further improved by using additional peaks with known energies. However , in later sections of this lab, it becomes clear that this error is acceptable.

All distances were measured with a ruler and thus have uncertainty . To compute the error in the integral of each photopeak, the multivariable error approach is taken. Due to the complicated nature of the analytical form of the integral, the exact form of the error is omitted; however , it is calculated within the Gaussian area function. ∘ ±0.5 mm 4/12/2021 James_Drake_Section1_ComptonScattering file:///C:/Users/drakej3/Downloads/James_Drake_Section1_ComptonScattering (4).html 9 /16 Both approaches are in good agreement, with Figure 5's height fit producing an and the area approach of Figure 6 yielding . Although the actual value for the inverse square law is not within the uncertainty of either fit, the fit is still very close to theoretical predictions. The reduced chi squared values both support the quality of the fits as well. T o improve on these measurements, it may be worth investigating decays at larger distances, as there is a significant measurement gap between and . Additionally , further isolating the Ba-133 from the nearby Cs-137 could lead to a reduced background and thus cleaner data. Comparatively , the area fit produced a reduced chi squared that was an order of magnitude smaller than the height fit, so it seems that calculating the area of the peaks provides a more accurate representation of the inverse square behavior of the photopeaks (though both are clearly adequate for demonstrating this ef fect). = −1.77 ± 0.05, = 14.67nh χ~2 = −1.78 ± 0.04, = 1.71na χ~2 n = −2 r = 0.16m r = 0.31m S ectio n 2 : A tten uatio n First, a measurement of the Cs-137 spectrum was taken without any copper plates between the detector and the source. Then, after blocking the source with the lead brick, a sheet of copper was added to the holder and placed halfway between the source and the detector . In each trial, the brick was removed and data acquisition started once the brick rested on the table. Once the brick was put back in place, another sheet was added and this procedure was repeated. The thickness of the copper sheets was assumed to be the same for each sheet, and the error on the digital calipers used to measure thickness was one-twentieth of a millimeter . 4/12/2021 James_Drake_Section1_ComptonScattering file:///C:/Users/drakej3/Downloads/James_Drake_Section1_ComptonScattering (4).html 10 /16 The data points in Figure 7 were generated by fitting the photopeak corresponding to an energy of , and thus the attenuation coef ficient for copper at this energy is found to be . NIST lists the attenuation coef ficient per density for in copper to be (https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/ElemT ab/z29.html (https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/ElemT ab/z29.html) ); when multiplied by the density of copper , we find . Thus, the measured is within the correct order of magnitude. Note that this literature comparison is between values for dif ferent photon energy , and a better comparison could be made with either an analytical form of or a computational fit using additional data from NIST . Potential sources of error arise from the stacking method of the plates, which involved leaning the plates against each other and caused minor slanting and thus minor thickness dif ferences, and material imperfections. Furthermore, the reduced chi squared value suggests that error was overestimated. T o reduce error , longer scans should be taken, as longer scans observe more events and thus have lower relative error . 661.7 keV μ = 19.43 ± 0.32m−1 E = 600 keV μ/ρ = 0.07625 /g cm2 = 8.96ρCu  g cm −3 μ = 0.6832 = 68.32cm −1  m −1 μ μ/ρ = 0.25χ~2 S ectio n 3 : C o mp to n S catterin g For each rod, scattering measurements were taken at angles ranging from 20 to 80 , in increments of 10 . The error in the angle was equal to one degree. The analysis involved fitting a Gaussian to the shifted photopeaks, then converting its centroid to an energy value. These energies were then correlated with the Compton scattering equation and an ODR fit provided the mass of the electron in .

For the aluminum rod, the linear relationship between the experimental and calculated cross section is as follows: For the unknown rod, the linear relationship between the experimental and calculated cross section is as follows: The error in the calculated cross section (as a function of and ) was found using multivariable error analysis, with the partial derivatives calculated using the central dif ference method. The error in the experimental cross section was found using multivariable error analysis, although its analytical form is much easier to compute: For Approach 1, ; conversely , Approach 2's error is non-zero because of the uncertainty in the flux at the detector and distance between the detector and the rod.

Both have good values (3.65 and 3.49 respectively), meaning that the linear fit model is a good approach for the data. Given that the literature value for the classical radius of an electron is , it is clear that Approach 1 produces a more accurate result, though both fits are still close to the correct order of magnitude and produce very nearly correct values.

List of for unknown material using Approaches 1 and 2, compared to several common machining materials . Figures 12 and 13 demonstrate the linear fits for using approaches 1 and 2 respectively , and Figure 14 compares the results of those fits to proposed values of for common machining materials. Originally , I expected the rod to be made of copper or bronze, and I leaned towards copper due to the dullness of the rod and its screw threads. Despite the good quality of the fits ( respectively), the data remains inconclusive, though Approach 1 yields a value that is somewhat close to those calculated for brass and copper . Both approaches suf fer from errors caused by dif ferences between the actual and measured electron radius. This is especially prevalent in the second approach, where the radius is about five times larger than the actual value. This issue is exacerbated by the squaring of the radius: if the measured value , the square , which gets larger as the dif ference between measured and literature value increases. Thus, this error could be a result of using an incorrect value of , which is supported by the drastic increase in in Approach 2. Considering that the unknown rod scattering data provided an excellent fit for Section 3, I do not think that the data is the source of the poor values of . It may instead suggest that the aluminum measurements should be improved so that they yield an electron radius that is closer to the actual value. Alternatively , both sets of data could be improved by taking longer measurements, as longer measurement times yield better statistics. = 1.12 × ± 0.03 ×  mre 10−15 10−15 = 13.45 × ± 0.35 ×  mre 10−15 10−15 χ~2 2.82 ×  m10−15 ×nθ 10 24 7.68 ± 0.40 1108.62 ± 50.66 558.15 ± 28.51 13.99 14.09 4.52 4.46 12.64 nθ nθ nθ = 5.16, 3.60χ~2 = − δrre,meas re,lit = − 2 δr + (δrr2 e,meas r2 e,lit re,lit )2 re nθ nθ 4/12/2021 James_Drake_Section1_ComptonScattering file:///C:/Users/drakej3/Downloads/James_Drake_Section1_ComptonScattering (4).html 16 /16 C o n clusio n Below is a table summarizing important values found during this experiment: Figure 15.
