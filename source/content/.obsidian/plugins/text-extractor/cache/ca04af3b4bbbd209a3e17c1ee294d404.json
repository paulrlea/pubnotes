These non-propagating fields contain subwavelength information. • Light-Matter Coupling: the strength of interaction between light and matter increases dramatically, enabling phenomena like: • Enhanced absorption and emission rates • Strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes • Purcell effect (enhanced spontaneous emission) • Dielectric Confinement: Light can be confined in high-index dielectric nanostructures through total internal reflection, creating resonant modes with enhanced field strengths. • Local Density of Optical States (LDOS): Describes available electromagnetic modes for photon emission at a specific position and frequency, directly affecting spontaneous emission rates. • Photonic Bandgaps: Periodic nanostructures (photonic crystals) can create frequency ranges where light propagation is forbidden, analogous to electronic bandgaps in semiconductors. • Optical Nonlinearities Dr Monika Szumilo Plasmonics – self study material plasmons—collective oscillations of free electrons in metals (quasiparticles) surface plasmon polariton (SPP) - a hybridized excitation arising from the coupling between photons and collective oscillations of free electron gas at metal-dielectric interfaces - subwavelength confinement - support high frequencies - typically metals or metal-like materials that exhibit negative real permittivity Dr Monika Szumilo Nanomagnetism 𝑅𝑠𝑑 = 36 𝐴 𝐾1 𝜇0𝑀𝑠 2 Critical single-domain radius: A – exchange stiffness K – anisotropy constant 𝜇0 - vacuum permeability Ms – saturation magnetisation • Single-domain particles exhibit different magnetic reversal mechanisms (coherent rotation rather than domain wall motion), which directly impacts coercivity and switching behavior in spintronic devices. • Just below the single-domain threshold, particles often display maximum coercivity (resistance to demagnetization) • As particles approach and drop below this size, they become increasingly susceptible to thermal fluctuations, eventually leading to superparamagnetic behavior (where magnetization randomly flips direction due to thermal energy).
