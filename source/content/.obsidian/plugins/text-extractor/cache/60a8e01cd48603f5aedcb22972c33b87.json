In December 2013, the FDA approved a new drug, sofosbuvir, for the treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C. The drug, commonly known as Sovaldi, was developed by Gilead Sciences, a U.S. biotechnology company. The initial price tag of a 12- week treatment of Sovaldi was reported as approximately $84,000, or nearly $1,000 per pill. This resulted in considerable media attention and an ensuing pricing controversy. Editorials and op-eds sprung up around the country debat- ing Sovaldi’s price tag and the broader debate over fair drug pricing. Some poli- ticians expressed outrage over the cost of new drugs, while others argued for free market pricing and rewards for the considerable R&D costs that biopharmaceuti- cal companies incur when bringing a new drug to market. The often niche drug pricing debate had officially spilled over into the mainstream conversation. Pay- ers, policymakers, pharma, patients, and providers all voiced strong— and some- times contrasting— opinions. At CHI, we aim to help these stakeholders increase their knowledge and under- standing of healthcare value, which we view as a function of quality, access, and cost. Thus, we decided to further explore the value of Sovaldi and how the costs and benefits of the drug relate to the broader discussion of the treatment of Hep- atitis C. Our goal is to offer a more informed and analytical approach to the dis- cussion of the value of Sovaldi. One question that immediately arose was “How does the price of Sovaldi compare to the long term costs of the treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C?” Our goal was to analyze the complex interrelationships and broader macroeconomic principles relating to the costs and benefits of a drug, as well as the long term costs of treating Chronic Hepatitis C. By analyzing the societal cost implications of Chronic Hepatitis C, we aim to help patients, providers, pharma, pharmacy, payers, and policymakers increase their knowledge and understanding of the value of this treatment—as well as the com- plex relationships between drug costs and the longer term costs of a disease. We hope that you find this white paper to be both thought-provoking and useful, and we welcome your feedback. We thank you for your interest, and we hope you enjoy our comprehensive analysis.

The twelve week treatment runs $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 for an entire regimen. These lofty costs immediately engendered a public de- bate about cost and value in healthcare, placing the pharmaceutical industry and health insurers in direct confrontation with state and federal agencies responsible for allocating fi- nancial resources. Decision-makers in these organiza- tions are tasked with determining who covers costs, the degree of financial resources for treatment, and whether the benefits of treatment outweigh economic costs to society. These deci- sions are central to the drug pricing conversation. At issue is the justifica- tion of drug pricing based on remu- neration for millions of dollars in re- search costs and the criterion that de- lineates reasonable profit from out- right extortion. Answers will shape the nexus of healthcare drug utilization and resource allocation for patients, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, taxpayers, and insurance and regula- tory agencies. The figures surrounding Sovaldi’s public debate are sobering. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that if the 3 million Americans infected with HCV were to be treated with Sovaldi at an average cost of $100,000 per treat- ment, the amount the U.S. spends on prescription drugs in one year would double from $300 billion to $600 bil- lion (Appleby, 2014). The costs of spe- cialty drugs like Sovaldi are expected to quadruple to $400 billion by 2020, which would account for 9.1% of na- tional health spending (UnitedHealth Center for Health Reform & Moderni- zation, 2014). The confluence of in- creasing drug costs and limited re- sources may elicit contentious topics such as determining who should re- ceive treatment. Should those in tax- payer-funded programs have the same access as the sickest patients? Should severity of disease dictate allocation priorities? The American Association for the study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases of Society believe Sovaldi should be the preferred treat- ment for all who are viremic. The De- partment of Veterans Affairs, however, argues for a treatment reserved only for those with advanced liver disease, a complication from chronic HCV in- fection. Currently, 47 states provide limited coverage of Sovaldi for their Medicaid populations. Half these states implement policies of “prior au- thorization” that require a patient be in the worst stages of hepatitis C for eligibility. States practicing these poli- cies are those with the largest Medi- caid populations and the most patients who suffer from HCV. Evaluating the costs of HCV treatment equips policy makers with the knowledge to enact policies that engender the best health outcomes at the “right” price. “The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that if the 3 million Americans infected with HCV were to be treated with Sovaldi at an average cost of $100,000 per treat- ment, the amount the U.S. spends on pre- scription drugs in one year would dou- ble from $300 billion to $600 billion.” THE SOVALDI PRICING DEBATE 6 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C The first step in answering these cost- benefit ethical and practical dilemmas is identifying the perspective from which costs and benefits are assessed. An individual suffering from a chronic illness weighs the costs and benefits of treatment differently from a policy maker who views costs from an aggre- gated perspective. An insurer may view the costs of treatment differently from a hospital that treats the disease and provides ancillary care. We take a so- cietal perspective. Costs are viewed as an aggregated sum to assess the cost burden of hepatitis C to the United States. Because states and local governments will have varied budget constraints when evaluating the costs of chronic illness, a cost anal- ysis will vary at the community level. However, the following thought exer- cise illustrates the importance of cost analyses when allocating finite re- sources across populations and is not limited to a national level. A second consideration is that cost- savings do not always equate to cost- effectiveness. A study published in Oc- tober 2014 found that the use of sofos- buvir-based treatment in prison popu- lations was cost-effective. Analysis showed, however, that treatment could cost as much as $30 billion for the Federal Bureau of Prisons and oth- er entities (Goldhaber-Fiebert et. al., 2014). Thus, while the treatment may be cost-effective, it may not be afford- able. Consequently, we will take a ho- listic approach to analyzing the costs of drug treatment with respect to drug pricing policies. Lastly, the time horizon is significant in chronic disease cost analyses. Costs may surpass the benefits of cost- saving treatments in the short term, but large cost-savings opportunities may eclipse initial expenses. Policy makers must be forward-thinking when assessing resource utilization and distribution. The time of drug in- tervention may vary depending on the severity and prevalence of disease. Chronic HCV exhibits a protracted dis- ease progression. In this evaluation, we choose a time horizon of ten years for analysis and discussion. METHODS OF EVALUATING SOCIETAL COST EFFECTIVENESS “Policy makers must be forward-thinking when assessing re- source utilization and distribution.” 7 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C Of the 4.1 million Americans who have been exposed to the hepatitis C (HCV) virus in the United States, 3.2 million Americans, or 1.3% of the population, suffer from chronic HCV infection (Armstrong et. al., 2006; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). A blood-borne disease that in- fects the liver, HCV accounts for one- third of all liver transplantations in the United States. Currently, the viral infec- tion is most often acquired by intrave- nous drug use. Prior to blood screen- ings in the early 1990’s, the virus was commonly spread through blood trans- fusions and organ transplantations. Table 1 provides a glimpse of the prev- alence of HCV infection in the United States by demographics. The most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) reveals HCV infection is more common in men than in women. The highest incidence of infection is among 40-49 year-olds and is owed to blood transfusions that predate uni- versal screening of blood donors. Prevalence is twice as high for non- Hispanic blacks than for both non- Hispanic whites and Mexican Ameri- cans. The large variation is almost en- tirely attributable to differences in old- er age groups. Non-Hispanic blacks between the ages of 40 and 49 experi- ence a prevalence of 9.4%. The demo- graphic group with the highest preva- lence is non-Hispanic black men in the age group 40-49 with an infection rate of 13.6%. Most individuals with HCV infection were born between 1945 and 1960. The prevalence of infection is likely greater than the aforementioned sta- tistics due to underrepresentation of high risk groups. One limitation of the PREVALENCE AND CLINICAL PROGRESSION OF HCV INFECTION Table 1 | Prevalence by Demographic Demographic Rate of Infection Total Men 2.1% Total Women 1.1% Non-Hispanic Blacks 3.0% Non-Hispanic Whites 1.5% Mexican Americans 1.3% Adapted from Armstrong et al. (2006). Prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in the United States, 1999 through 2002. Annals of Internal Medicine, 144, 705–714. “3.2 million Ameri- cans, or 1.3% of the population, suffer from chronic HCV in- fection.” 8 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C “A 2013 report by the New England Journal of Medicine estimates that of the 3.2 million Americans living with the virus, only about half have been diagnosed.” NHANES study is that it does not include homeless or incarcerated individuals. In one study, research- ers detected HCV antibodies, an in- dicator for viral infection, in 41.7% of homeless veterans (Cheung et. al., 2002). The incarcerated population in the U.S. has a similarly high HCV exposure rate. One study estimates that 12% to 45% of the prison popu- lation has been exposed to the HCV virus (Weinbaum et al., 2005). Re- lated studies estimate a prevalence of 30% to 40% for inmates (Gough et. al., 2010; Vescio et. al., 2008). This means that of the 6,899,000 reported incarcerated individuals in the United States (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2014), between 2,070,000 and 2,760,000 may have been ex- posed to HCV. The estimate of 3.2 million with chronic HCV is taken from the National Health and Nutri- tion Examination Survey between 1999 and 2002 and is still the most cited estimate of the prevalence of HCV in the U.S. The most accurate estimate of those with chronic HCV may in fact be much higher. The most ominous aspect of HCV is its ability to cause severe liver dam- age years before symptoms appear. A 2013 report by the New England Journal of Medicine estimates that of the 3.2 million Americans living with the virus, only about half have been diagnosed. Moreover, fewer than 40% of those infected receive medical care for the condition. In 2009, there were an estimated 16,000 cases of acute hepatitis C in the United States (Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention, 2014). A short-term illness lasting up to 6 months, acute infection is typically asymptomatic. However, 70% to 90% of those with HCV infection will develop chronic infection (Jakate, 2013). Those with chronic HCV may exhibit nonspecific symptoms of fa- tigue, nausea, weight loss, arthralgi- Figure 1 | HCV Disease Pr ogr ession 9 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C as, or weakness. Of these, 20% to 40% will develop cirrhosis and related com- plications over a 10 to 20 year horizon (Jenkins & Aronsohn, 2013). Hepatic failure occurs in one-third of patients with HCV cirrhosis after 10 years (Planas et. al., 2004). Figure 1 illus- trates hepatitis C progression from acute infection to death and corre- sponding percentages of individuals who advance into each stage. Chronic HCV begins six months after infection and continues for decades. Chronic infection causes inflammation of the liver, resulting in liver fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. Approximate- ly 20% to 40% of patients will develop cirrhosis 20 years post infection, and 41% by 30 years (Thein et. al., 2008). Hepatic failure occurs in one-third of individuals with HCV cirrhosis for over 10 years. Five-year survival for those who experience hepatic failure is 50% (Planas et. al., 2004). The rate of liver degeneration from HCV varies by individual. The slow progression and asymptomatic nature of the disease leaves many individuals unaware of their condition. For this reason, most cases are undiagnosed until after the onset of liver disease when costs for treatment are highest. 10 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C PART 2: Comparison of Treatment Costs and Analysis 11 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C Chronic diseases such as hepatitis C are costly in many ways. Direct costs include payments for treatment and side effects, physician visits, and drug costs. Indirect costs, while not explicitly measured, are incurred by lost time from work, reduced productivity, and decreased quality of life. Chronic dis- eases are especially costly as both di- rect and indirect costs compound over one’s lifetime. Consideration of both direct and indirect costs of disease and medical treatment is essential for de- termining the true value of resource allocation in health systems. Chronic diseases account for about $3 of every $4 dollars spent on healthcare, or about $7,900 per Amer- ican with at least one chronic illness (Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention, 2007). Direct and indirect costs in the U.S. for HCV were an esti- mated $5.46 billion in 1997. Direct medical costs are predicted to increase to $10.7 billion for the period 2010 through 2019, mostly due to the in- creasing number of HCV patients with advanced liver disease (Wong et. al., 2000). Estimated health care costs for managed care organization enrollees with HCV were $20,961 per patient per year (PPPY) from 2002 through 2006 (Davis et. al., 2011). One retro- spective analysis, estimated that all- cause health care costs to commercial insurers for individuals with HCV were $14,915, or twice as high as costs for non-HCV enrollees with similar health statuses (McAdam-Marx et al., 2011). They found all-cause PPPY in- cremental costs were more than $27,000 in patients with decompen- sated cirrhosis and $93,000 for those requiring liver transplant. A similar study (Gordon et. al., 2012) segmented the costs of HCV to the U.S. health system by severity of dis- ease. They found annual all-cause healthcare costs to be $24,176 for pa- tients with chronic HCV infection. They derived average annual cost esti- mates of $17,277 for patients with noncirrhotic liver disease, $22,752 for patients with compensated cirrhosis, and $59,995 for patients with end- stage renal disease. Pharmacy, ambu- latory, and inpatient care accounted for 90% of costs for noncirrhotic liver disease and 93% for compensated cir- rhosis and endstage renal disease. Khoury et. al. (2012) estimated total direct costs between $694 and $1,660 million per year. Accounting for sever- ity of disease, they approximated the cost of hepatocellular carcinoma as $140 million per year and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis at $1,421 million per year. Indirect costs include forgone earn- ings or production due to hospitaliza- tion, ambulatory care, premature death, and work loss. Some studies estimated indirect costs of $490 per year per diagnosed individual (Everheart & Ruhl, 2010). Khoury et. al. (2012) found indirect costs for HCV per individual per year totaled $10,316. Of this, $2,107 was lost to absenteeism and $8,209 was lost to presenteeism. They found average to- tal costs were $27,000 per untreated HCV infected patient per year. Varia- tion in indirect costs are due to defini- tions of direct and indirect costs in “Chronic diseases ac- count for about $3 of every $4 dollars spent on healthcare, or about $7,900 per American with at least one chronic ill- ness.” COSTS OF HCV UNTREATED empirical studies and the time at which the study is conducted. As chronic HCV progresses, costs as- sociated with its treatment increase. The only treatment for end stage liver disease is orthotopic liver transplanta- tion (replacing the liver of the recipi- ent with a donor liver). It is estimated that HCV is responsible for one-third of all liver transplants in the United States. The average cost of liver trans- plantation was an estimated $201,110 in 2010 U.S. dollars (Hilst et. al., 2009). Estimates from the C. Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth Universi- ty approximate that at a cost of $280,000 per liver transplant, the costs from liver transplantation for hepatitis C alone total $300 million each year. Moreover, the Institute esti- mates the average lifetime cost for hepatitis C, excluding liver transplan- tation, to be $100,000 per individual. Thus, if 80% of the 4.5 million Ameri- cans who may be infected develop chronic liver disease, the collective lifetime cost would be $360 billion. Assuming a 40-year survival rate, the annual health care costs for the U.S. population with chronic hepatitis C reaches $9 billion (C. Everett Koop Institute, 2015), which is compounded by the fact that recurrence of the HCV virus is nearly universal in transplant patients (Tsoulfas et. al., 2009). In a study by the University of California Los Angeles of 500 patients evaluated over ten years, researchers found a median reoccurrence of HCV infection of three years (Ghobrial et. al., 2001). 12 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C “Thus, if 80% of the 4.5 million Ameri- cans who may be in- fected develop chron- ic liver disease, the collective lifetime cost would be $360 billion.” 13 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C Aside from physician visits for diagnos- ing, treating, and monitoring disease complications from chronic illness, costs are incurred from the drug itself. Successful treatment for HCV may pre- vent or slow disease progression, cur- tailing future costly outcomes such as liver transplantation. Drug therapies yield sunk costs if the treatment drug proves ineffective, produces intolerable adverse side effects, or causes death. The criterion for success of any HCV treatment is a sustained viral response (SVR), defined as a negative HCV ri- bonucleic acid level as measured by a polymerase chain reaction 24 weeks after final treatment (Dawravoo & Martin Cohen, 2013). Standard treat- ment for hepatitis C includes a combi- nation of pegylated interferon and rib- avirin (PEG-RBV) for 48 weeks, taken twice daily. The genotype of the pa- tient is a significant determinant of success. Of the 6 major genotypes, genotype 1 is the most common in the United States and represents 70% of Americans. Patients with genotype 1 exhibit the lowest response rate, around 40%, to PEG-RBV. In addition to its low success rate, PEG-RBV pro- duces universal side effects that in- clude fatigue, flu-like symptoms, anxi- ety, skin rash, anemia, depression, and gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea (U.S. Department of Vet- erans Affairs). A comprehensive listing of negative symptoms and frequencies follows. Side effects reduce adherence to therapy and induce suboptimal dos- COSTS OF USUAL CARE Table 2 | PEG-RBV Therapy Side Effects and Estimated Frequencies Side Effect Frequency (%) Fatigue 54-64 Headache 47-62 Myalgias (muscle pain) 42-56 Pyrexia (fever) 43-46 Rigors (chills) 24-48 Insomnia 37-40 Nausea 29-43 Alopecia 28-36 Irritability 24-35 Arthralgias (joint pain) 27-34 Anorexia 21-32 Depression 22-31 Dermatitis 21-24 Adapted from McGowan, C., & Fried, M.

In some trials 10% to 14% of patients discontin- ued treatment due to adverse ef- fects. Furthermore, dose reduc- tions, which strongly correlate to reduced success rates, occurred in 32% to 42% of patients (Fried et. al., 2002; Manns et. al., 2001). Due to adverse treatment-related events, it is recommended that pa- tients taking PEG-RBV receive rou- tine laboratory testing at weeks 2, 4, and every 4 to 8 weeks thereaf- ter, increasing direct medical costs in physician visits and testing. Few studies have evaluated the di- rect economic cost of PEG-RBV treatment. One such study uses a medical claims database of 20,002 individuals to evaluate direct eco- nomic costs of treatment over a five -year period. Solomon et. al. (2011), found that HCV-treated pa- tients had higher overall costs rela- tive to HCV-untreated patients which were driven mainly by phar- maceutical drugs of PEG-RBV drug therapy. Treated patients had fewer hospitalizations and lower average length-of-stay, but more outpatient physician visits due to active treat- ment monitoring requirements. For HCV-treated patients, total di- rect medical costs were $28,547 versus $21,752 for non-treated HCV patients. For untreated-HCV patients, costs were $17,419 for outpatient pharmacy expenditures, $894 for outpatient physician vis- its, $3,942 inpatient costs, and $366 in emergency room costs. 15 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C At $84,000 per treatment, Sovaldi is expensive. Traditional drug treatments are less expensive but exhibit low suc- cess rates and many side effects. Con- versely, Sovaldi exhibits high success rates, effectively curbing complications from HCV infection and repressing continued liver damage. As a result, long term costs decrease. Patients us- ing Sovaldi also experience fewer side effects, which increases adherence and reduces wasteful spending on discon- tinued treatment and unforeseen ad- verse events. With 16,000 cases of HCV infection reported each year (Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention, 2009), HCV will remain a significant burden on health systems without appropriate intervention. Less than one-third of patients with chronic HCV have been referred for disease management, and of those only 3% to 6% are treated (North et. al., 2013). As noted earlier, the high prevalence of HCV in the Ba- by Boomer generation will only add to the economic burden of HCV as the cohort ages. Current estimates find that the Baby Boomer generation ac- counts for 75% of those with chronic HCV in the United States (Younossi, 2014). It has been estimated that by 2020, the proportion of patients with cirrhosis will increase from 16% to 20%, hepatocellular carcinoma will increase by 81%, and liver-related deaths will increase by 180% (Davis et. Al., 2003). Although HCV-related complications and costs are expected to rise, breakthrough drugs like Soval- di present a viable solution. Sovaldi’s high SVR is expected to decrease long- term outcomes associated with HCV progression. Patients taking Sovaldi experience SVR rates between 87% and 93% (Lawitz et. al., 2014). Fur- ther, SVR is associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and hepatocellular carcino- ma in HCV-infected patients (van der Meer, 2012). The most common side effects of Sovaldi are fatigue, head- ache, and nausea. In Phase III trials of Sovaldi, 2% of patients discontinued treatment compared to 4% in the pla- cebo group. 5% of patients in the treat- ment group experienced serious side effects compared to 3% in the placebo group (Lam et. al., 2014). Clinical tri- als report a 95% success rate for Soval- di treatment. “Although HCV- related complications and costs are ex- pected to rise, break- through drugs like Sovaldi present a via- ble solution.” ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF SOVALDI 16 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C The costs of untreated HCV as well as associated treatments are detailed in the literature. Cost-effectiveness anal- yses of HCV treatment commonly eval- uate treatments in QALYs (quality- adjusted life years), providing a com- posite measure of overall health and well being in response to a treatment intervention. Incremental cost effective- ness ratios (ICERs) are also utilized to determine the comparative advantages of various treatments. Many HCV anal- yses have compared the relative costs of untreated HCV patients with those who experience drug intervention. As noted previously, many studies focus on the costs of each stage of HCV. The framework for this empirical investiga- tion is a simple cost analysis. Using published data, costs of annual per- patient usual care treatment are com- pared to the annual per-patient costs of treatment with Sovaldi over a ten year period. To begin, it is assumed that 3.2 million people are currently infected with chronic HCV in the United States. Of these, it is assumed that only half are aware of their infection and only 20% are referred for treatment. This trans- lates to 10% of the 3.2 million infected individuals who potentially begin treatment. Furthermore, we assume that 100% of this cohort elect to begin treatment with Sovaldi at a 95% suc- cess rate. Thus, if each year 16,000 new infections are documented, 1,600 new individuals will begin a treatment regimen annually in this model. Be- cause the costs of death are difficult to quantify over an aggregated popula- tion, the number of deaths per year are omitted from the analysis. In the case of Sovaldi treatment, 5% will fail at achieving a successful SVR. Once an individual fails treatment it is as- sumed he will not elect additional treatment and incur the annual direct and indirect costs of untreated HCV. Costs are calculated over a ten year period and indexed to 2010 US dol- lars. Treatment with Sovaldi costs $79,000 in 2010 US dollars.

Based on the literature, 50% of those who elect usual care treat- ment will achieve a successful SVR. Costs for untreated HCV and usual care treatments are taken from published literature. Values used in the analysis are derived from aver- aging costs from selected sources. Table 3 exhibits findings from se- lected empirical studies. (A sum- mary table of costs indexed to 2010 US dollars is located in the Appen- dix.) Only studies that demarcate un- treated costs of HCV and costs of usual care are included for analysis. Additionally, only studies that ex- clude HIV coinfection are included to provide a more robust represen- tation of HCV-related costs. Of note is the work by McAdam-Marx et. al. (2011), who retrospectively evaluate claims data to determine per pa- tient per year (PPPY) costs for HCV disease states. They find PPPY costs range from more than $27,000 PPPY in patients with decompen- sated cirrhosis to more than $93,000 in patients in need of liver transplantation. Rosenberg et. al. (2000) is omitted from empirical analysis as their data includes cases of HIV coinfection. Following the assumptions listed, the calculated costs for Sovaldi and usual care treatment are noted ac- cordingly: Year 1: (320,000*cost of Sovaldi) = Total costs in Year 1 Year 2: (5% unsuccessful in Year 1*costs untreated) + (# of new entrants*cost of Sovaldi)= Total costs in Year 2 Year 3: (% unsuccessful from Years 1 & 2*costs untreated) + (# of new entrants* cost of Sovaldi)= Total costs in Year 3 The same logic is applied in years four through ten. Similarly, the equation for annual Usual Care (UC) costs is: Year1: (320,000*cost of UC) = Total costs in Year 1 Year 2: (50% unsuccessful patients*cost untreated) + (# of new entrants*cost of UC) = Total costs in Year 2 Year 3: (% unsuccessful patients from Years 1 and 2*cost untreated) + (# of new entrants* cost of UC) = Total costs in Year 3 “They find PPPY (per patient per year) costs range from more than $27,000 PPPY in patients with decompensated cir- rhosis to more than $93,000 in patients in need of liver trans- plantation” 18 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C The same logic is applied in years four through ten. Completing the calculations through ten years yields results shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 | Costs of Sovaldi vs. Usual Car e Tr eatment Table 4 | Costs Per Year by Treatment Year Sovaldi Usual Care 1 $25,280,000,000 $9,378,560,000 2 $524,592,000 $4,028,812,800 3 $526,582,960 $4,048,722,400 4 $528,572,920 $4,068,632,000 5 $530,564,880 $4,088,541,600 6 $532,555,840 $4,108,451,200 7 $534,546,800 $4,128,360,800 8 $536,537,760 $4,148,270,400 9 $538,528,720 $4,168,180,000 10 $540,519,680 $4,188,089,600 19 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C Compounding ten years of costs, we found that costs from treating HCV with Sovaldi are greater than usual care treatment in the short run. Howev- er, by year six, the costs for usual care treatment outweigh the costs for treat- ment with Sovaldi. Yearly costs for usu- al care are much higher than those for Sovaldi due to lower success rates. Alt- hough the cost of Sovaldi treatment is initially high, the opportunity to avoid costs from HCV-related complications in the future outweighs the initial finan- cial burden. As with all cost analyses, limitations should be considered. Average costs per patient per year are taken from a number of published studies that em- ploy different empirical methods with differing population sizes. The number of individuals who die each year due to HCV were omitted due to the difficulty in ascribing a monetary value to the loss of life. However, given that three- fourths of those with chronic infection are ages 40-49, the absence of work- life productivity lost may not be signif- icant. This analysis assumes a con- stant number of newly infected indi- viduals and costs for each treatment, resulting in linearly projected costs. As Baby-Boomers’ complications from HCV become more pronounced with disease progression, costs may actual- ly be greater in the future without drug intervention. It is also important to note that costs used in this analysis are aggregated across all HCV-infected individuals. HCV-related costs become increasingly greater with disease pro- gression. Average costs are sensitive to the number of people in each disease state. For example, if more people ad- vance to the costliest stages of HCV than there are people in the earlier stages, average costs per individual will increase substantially. Moreover, HCV exhibits significant variation in prevalence among racial groups. As a societal lens was adopted for this pa- per, costs in this analysis do not ac- count for racial variability. One topic excluded from the analysis is that of HIV coinfection. HIV coinfection oc- curs in 25% of those infected with HCV and triples the risk for liver dis- ease, liver failure, and liver-related death from HCV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, March 2014). An important consideration is that this analysis also does not account for the benefit of reducing the number of in- dividuals with the potential to spread disease. The benefit of reducing the number of viral individuals may ne- gate short-run costs. It is difficult, however, to quantify material benefits of preventing future infections. In re- viewing the literature, no studies were found that address this topic. Future empirical analyses would benefit from computing these intangibles for the purpose of supporting a more compre- hensive understanding of the HCV cost burden. “By year six, the costs for usual care treatment outweigh the costs for treat- ment with Sovaldi.” ANALYSIS 20 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C While the comparative effectiveness of two treatments was omitted from this analysis, the subject of drug costs was explored. Developing a cohort of indi- viduals infected with chronic HCV in the U.S., costs per patient were as- cribed to two treatments. Building on a framework of assumptions from pub- lished literature, costs of two treat- ments were projected ten years into the future. While Sovaldi was more costly in the first five years, it becomes cost- saving in the years thereafter. Policy makers must be forward- thinking when enacting policy. While upfront costs of new drug therapies appear excessive, the potential future savings may be worth the price. Drugs with promising success rates reduce the number of future infections by di- minishing the number of infected indi- viduals. This is especially important for diseases that are initially asympto- matic such as HCV. Since 50% of indi- viduals with HCV are unaware of their infection, any drug therapy, policy prescription, or combination that lim- its future infection must be consid- ered. Developing sound policy pre- scriptions for select HCV drug treat- ments should consider the following: How many individuals are in the treat- ment population? What is the distri- bution of disease severity in the popu- lation? What is the racial composition of the population? What is the time horizon for treatment? What are the aggregated direct and indirect costs of competing treatments? And lastly, who will pay for cost-saving treat- ment? The number of individuals within a treatment population is positively cor- related with costs. If the number of patients is so high that costs become unwieldy, the decision to strategically allocate pecuniary resources becomes necessary. The severity of disease and degree of liver degeneration increases the direct and indirect costs of treat- ment. It may benefit a community more in the long-run to subsidize a costly treatment like Sovaldi if many young adults are infected. By spending more in the short-run and reducing HCV complications for young adults, costly future indirect costs stemming from work-loss, increased hospitaliza- tions, and liver transplantation may be avoided. The disproportionate effects of HCV infection on race may warrant specialized policy action. For example, a population that is significantly non- Hispanic Black, due to its high infec- tion rate and disease prevalence, may warrant a policy that targets those at- risk populations. Preventive screen- ings may present an appropriate mechanism to defray HCV costs to these populations. Additionally, the time frame for implementation pro- vides a lens from which to assess costs, as cost-savings and cost-effectiveness are not always concordant. Usual care treatment presents significant cost- savings in the short term, but Sovaldi may be more cost-effective in the long run. As the majority of those with chronic HCV are aging, they will experience costly HCV complications and increase the economic burden of HCV. Taxpay- er funded programs like Medicare and Medicaid will pay for expensive HCV- related complications for infected in- dividuals. In summary, the total HCV- related costs to society are substantial and will only increase in the near fu- ture. With state and federal govern- ment entering the drug pricing discus- sion, conversations should consider cost not as a fixed price tag, but as an investment to reduce future costly health outcomes. “In summary, the to- tal HCV-related costs to society are sub- stantial and will only increase in the near future. With state and federal govern- ment entering the drug pricing discus- sion, conversations should consider cost not as a fixed price tag, but as an invest- ment to reduce future costly health out- comes.” EXPANDING THE CONVERSATION 21 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C Value plays a pivotal role in policy pre- scriptions regarding the allocation of financial resources to medical care. Costs and benefits from treatment must be considered to accurately assess the true value of drug interventions to soci- ety. Evaluating the costs of untreated HCV disease progression, standard pegylat- ed interferon and ribavirin treatment, and treatment with Sovaldi provides a comprehensive understanding of po- tential societal cost-savings. We find that Sovaldi’s current pricing is justi- fied from a societal value perspective. While Sovaldi’s price is more costly than alternate treatments in the short term, its high success rate drives in- creased value in the long term. Due to its high success rate, Sovaldi may re- duce future infections and costly treat- ments for advanced liver degenera- tion, defraying even larger future costs. Drug prices are not simple one-off costs. They reflect both immediate and future benefits in the way of increasing quality of life, reducing costly opera- tions, and hindering the spread of fu- ture disease. To the contrary, they re- flect additional costs by adverse effects from treatment or reduced adherence. Evaluating direct and indirect costs over an appropriate time horizon re- veals the true value of any drug inter- vention. Sovaldi, at $84,000 per treat- ment, exhibits justifiable societal val- ue. “Sovaldi, at $84,000 per treatment, exhib- its justifiable societal value.” CONCLUSION 22 The Value of Sovaldi: Societal Cost Issues of New Interventions on Hepatitis C REFERENCES Appleby, Julie.
