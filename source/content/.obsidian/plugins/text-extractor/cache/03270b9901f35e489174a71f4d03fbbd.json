A mass m is free to slide on a frictionless table and is connected by a string, of length I ‘which passes through a hole in the table, to a mass M which hangs below (see figure below). Assume that M moves in a vertical line only, and assume that the string always remains taut a) Find the Lagrange equations of motion for the variables r and ¢/shown in the figure. (vou do not need to find solutions to these differential equations) b) Under what condition does m undergo circular motion? Solve for the circular motion radius, ro, in this case. ©) What is the frequency of small oscillations (in the variable r) about this circular ‘motion?
