A matrix representation of expansions This will provide a compact way of describing eigenvalue expansions. First let’s consider expressing an ordinary two dimensional vector in Cartesian coordinates. Ԧ𝑟 = 𝑟𝑥 Ƹ𝑖 + 𝑟𝑦 Ƹ𝑗 By convention we can represent this as a column vector with the coefficients for each unit vector: Ԧ𝑟 = 𝑟𝑥 𝑟𝑦 Eigenfunction expansions Assume the operator 𝐴𝑜𝑝 has two orthonormal eigenfunctions, 𝜓1 𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜓2(𝑥) with eigenvalues 𝑎1𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎2. An arbitrary state of the particle is given by: 𝜓 𝑥 = 𝑐1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝜓2. Similarly to spatial vectors we can express 𝜓(𝑥) as a vector of components. 𝜓 𝑥 = 𝑐1 𝑐2 So that 𝜓1 = 1 0 and 𝜓2 = 0 1 In bra-ket notation: | ۧ𝜓 = 𝑐1 𝑐2 is a column vector. Eigenfunction expansions ۦ𝜓| = 𝜓∗ = 𝑐1 ∗ 𝑐2 ∗ is a row vector, so that the inner product yields the probability density: 𝜓|𝜓 = 𝑐1 ∗𝑐1 + 𝑐2 ∗𝑐2 We can extend this to calculate the inner product (overlap integral) of two arbitrary states: 𝜓 = 𝑐1Ψ1 + 𝑐2𝜓2 = 𝑐1 𝑐2 and 𝜙 = 𝑑1𝜓1 + 𝑑2𝜓2 = 𝑑1 𝑑2 So 𝜓|𝜙 = 𝑐1 ∗𝑑1 + 𝑐2 ∗𝑑2 = 𝑐1 ∗ 𝑐2 ∗ 𝑑1 𝑑2 Matrix representation of an operator How do we represent 𝐴𝑜𝑝 in ۧ|𝜓′ = 𝐴𝑜𝑝 ۧ|𝜓 ? Where ۧ|𝜓 = Σ𝑖𝑐𝑖 ۧ|𝑢𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ۧ|𝜓′ = Σ𝑖𝑐𝑖 ′ ۧ|𝑢𝑖 where 𝑐𝑖 ′ = 𝑢𝑖|𝜓′ = 𝑢𝑖|𝐴𝑜𝑝|𝜓 and so 𝐴11 𝐴12 … 𝐴21 𝐴22 … … … … where 𝐴𝑖𝑗 = 𝑢𝑖 𝐴𝑜𝑝 𝑢𝑗 Matrix expression or an operator - by example The operator 𝐴𝑜𝑝 thus does the following to the wavefunction: 𝐴𝑜𝑝𝜓 = 𝑐1𝑎1𝜓1 + 𝑐2𝑎2𝜓2 or 𝐴𝑜𝑝𝜓 = 𝐴𝑜𝑝 𝑐1 𝑐2 = 𝑎1 0 0 𝑎2 𝑐1 𝑐2 The fact that the 𝐴𝑜𝑝 matrix is diagonal actually tells us that 𝜓1𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜓2 are eigenfunctions of 𝐴𝑜𝑝. As an example of using matrix representations: Let’s define the operator 𝐵𝑜𝑝according to: 𝐵𝑜𝑝 ≡ 𝑐2𝜓1 + 𝑐1𝜓2 (note the switcheroo) In vector form: 𝐵𝑜𝑝 𝑐1 𝑐2 = 𝑐2 𝑐1 The B matrix that does this is: 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 𝑐1 𝑐2 = 𝑐2 𝑐1 So we see that 𝐵𝑜𝑝 and 𝐴𝑜𝑝 do not share any eigenfunctions, because the B matrix has no diagonal components.. Let’s now try to find the eigenvalues of 𝐵𝑜𝑝𝜓 = 𝑏𝜓. 0 1 1 0 𝑐1 𝑐2 = 𝑏 𝑐1 𝑐2 = 𝑏𝑐1 𝑏𝑐2 = 𝑏 0 0 𝑏 𝑐1 𝑐2 Or −𝑏 1 1 −𝑏 𝑐1 𝑐2 =0 You might recognize problems of this type from linear algebra. In order for there to be a non-trivial solution, we must have: −𝑏 1 1 −𝑏 = 0 and thus 𝑏2 = 1 𝑜𝑟 𝑏 = ±1 For 𝑏 = 1, we have −1 1 1 −1 𝑐1 𝑐2 =0 or 𝑐1 = 𝑐2 and the eigenfunction of 𝐵𝑜𝑝 expressed in terms of eigenfunctions of 𝐴𝑜𝑝 is 𝜓𝐵1 = 𝑐1 1 1 and if we normalize it: 𝜓𝐵1(𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑒𝑛) = 1 2 1 1 For 𝑏 = −1, we have 1 1 1 1 𝑐1 𝑐2 =0 or 𝑐1 = −𝑐2 and the eigenfunction of 𝐵𝑜𝑝 expressed in terms of eigenfunctions of 𝐴𝑜𝑝 is 𝜓𝐵−1 = 𝑐1 1 −1 and if we normalize it: 𝜓𝐵−1(𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑒𝑛) = 1 2 1 −1 This was complicated way to solve a simple problem, but it displays the way in which matrix approaches can be used. Spin • Assume the eigenfunctions of the z-component of the spin of a spin ½ particle are 𝜒+for a spin aligned along a magnetic field and 𝜒− for an anti-aligned spin, so that: 𝑆𝑧𝜒+ = ℏ 2 𝜒+ and 𝑆𝑧𝜒− = − ℏ 2 𝜒− • An arbitrary state can be represented by a vector of the coefficients: 𝜒𝑎𝑟𝑏 = 𝑐+ 𝑐− 𝜒+ = 1 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜒− = 0 1 Spin Matrices Representing the eigenfunctions as vectors: 𝜒+ = 1 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜒− = 0 1 We can find the matrix operator by assuming 𝑆𝑧 = 𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 𝑑 And we want 𝑆𝑧𝜒+ = ℏ 2 𝜒+ or 𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 𝑑 1 0 = 𝑎 𝑐 = ℏ 2 1 0 So that 𝑎 = 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐 = 0. We also want 𝑆𝑧𝑜𝑝𝜒− = ℏ 2 1 𝑏 0 𝑑 0 1 = − ℏ 2 0 1 So that 𝑏 = 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑑 = −1 The operator for the z-component of the spin angular momentum can therefore be represented as: 𝑆𝑧𝑜𝑝 = ℏ 2 1 0 0 −1 Spin Matrices 2 Let’s find the matrix for 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 . We know that a particle in a spin up state satisfies: 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 𝜒+ = 𝑠 𝑠 + 1 ℏ2𝜒+ = 3 4 ℏ2𝜒+ 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 𝜒− = 𝑠 𝑠 + 1 ℏ2𝜒− = 3 4 ℏ2𝜒− To find the eigenfunctions and values we write S2 as a matrix with unknown elements: 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 = 𝑒 𝑓 𝑔 ℎ So that 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 𝜒+ = 𝑒 𝑓 𝑔 ℎ 1 0 = 3 4 ℏ2 𝑒 𝑔 = 3 4 ℏ2 1 0 And thus 𝑒 𝑔 = 3 4 ℏ2 0 . Similarly, 𝑓 = 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑔 = 3 4 ℏ2 Spin 3 Putting the coefficients into the matrix representation: 𝑆𝑜𝑝 2 = 3 4 ℏ 2 1 0 0 1 We can also deduce the operators for 𝑆𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑆𝑦. 𝑆𝑥 = ℏ 2 0 1 1 0 and 𝑆𝑦 = ℏ 2 0 −𝑖 𝑖 0 and using a standard notation:𝑆𝑥 = ℏ 2 𝜎𝑥 Where 𝜎𝑥 = 0 1 1 0 … The sigma’s are called the Pauli spin matrices. Spin Matrices • Note that the matrices for 𝑆𝑧 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑆2 are diagonal, indicating that 𝜒+ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜒− are eigenfunctions of these operators. • The matrices for 𝑆𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑆𝑦 are not diagonal, indicating that 𝜒+ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜒− are not eigenfunctions of these operators. Some Matrix Math • We can now find the commutator of 𝑆𝑥𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑆𝑦. 𝑆𝑥, 𝑆𝑦 = ℏ 2 4 0 1 1 0 0 −𝑖 𝑖 0 − ℏ 2 4 0 −𝑖 𝑖 0 0 1 1 0 = ℏ2 4 𝑖 0 0 −𝑖 − −𝑖 0 0 𝑖 = ℏ2 2 𝑖 0 0 −𝑖 so 𝑆𝑥, 𝑆𝑦 = 𝑖ℏ𝑆𝑧","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
