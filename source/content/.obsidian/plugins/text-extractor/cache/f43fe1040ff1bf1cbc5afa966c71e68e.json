Calculate the probability that the position of the two particles finds them both in the left hand side of the box, that is 0<𝑥1<𝐿/2 and 0<𝑥2<𝐿/2, for each of these symmetry combinations. Carry out this calculation symbolically showing steps and then evaluate the probability.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
