Consider observations (Yit, Xit) from the linear panel data model Yit = Xitβ1 + αi + λit + uit, where t = 1, ∙ ∙ ∙ , T ; i = 1, ∙ ∙ ∙ , n; and αi + λit is an unobserved individual specific time trend that potentially correlated with Xit. How would you estimate β1 consistently? Please write down your procedure in details. 2. Suppose we have the following AR(2) process yt = 0.3yt−1 + 0.1yt−2 + εt, where εt ∽ W N (0, 1) (a) Determine whether yt is weakly stationary? Please justify your an- swer. (b) Compute E(yt), V ar(yt) and Cov(yt, yt−k) for k = 1, 2. (c) Compute the ACF ρk for k = 1, 2. (d) Compute the PACF akk for k = 1, 2. 3. Suppose we have the following AR(1) process yt = 2 + yt−1 + εt, where εt ∽ W N (0, 1) for all t, y0 ∽ W N (0, 1) and is independent of εt for all t, (a) Compute E(yt), V ar(yt) and Cov(yt, yt−k) for k = 1, 2. (b) Compute the ACF ρk for k = 1, 2. (c) Compute the PACF akk for k = 1, 2. 1","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
