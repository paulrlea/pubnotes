Explain in words what each term represents. Words 2) What is the approximate frequency, energy, and wavelength of a red light photon like that from the laser in the interference labs? Wavelength (nm)_______; Frequency(Hz)_________; Energy (Joules):_________Energy (eV):________ 3) A 650 nm laser emits power of 0.001 W. How many photons per second does the laser emit? __________photons/s 4) Light of wavelength 400 nm is incident on a surface with intensity of 0.50 W/m2. The wavelength of the light is increased to 700 nm while maintaining the same intensity. Does the flux per area (photons/m2s) increase, decrease, or remain the same? Explain. 5) When ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 400 nm falls on a certain metal surface, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is 1.10 eV. What is the kinetic energy if the wavelength is changed to 350 nm?
