Where Ψ∗( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡) denotes the complex conjugate of Ψ( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡). Notes 3 Quantum Physics 1 8 Principle of Superposition If Ψ1 and Ψ2 represent two physically realizable states of a system, then the linear combination Ψ = 𝑐1Ψ1 + 𝑐2Ψ2 is also a physically realizable state of the system. Notes 3 Quantum Physics 1 9 Normalization • Sometimes you will be given wave functions that lead to an integrated probability that is not already 1. (or that have an unspecified multiplicative constant.) • Before you try to do any calculation with a wavefunction, you should make sure it is properly normalized.* Given an un−normalized wavefunction Ψ′ such that න −∞ ∞ Ψ′ ∗ ( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡)Ψ′( Ԧ𝑟, 𝑡)𝑑𝑣 = 𝑀 just multiply Ψ′ by the constant 1 M to create a new function: Ψ(x,t) = Ψ′(x,t) 𝑀 that will be normalized. * exception: pure momentum wave Notes 3 Quantum Physics 1 10 Physical constraints on wavefunctions • A physical wavefunction must be normalizable. (The particle must be somewhere.) • A physical wavefunction must be single valued. (It can’t have two probabilities of being at the same point.) • A physical wavefunction must be continuous. • The spatial derivatives must be continuous unless there is an infinite potential energy step. Notes 3 Quantum Physics 1 11 Expectation value • In quantum mechanics, the ensemble average of an observable for a particular state of the system is called the expectation value of that observable.

Notes 4 Quantum Physics 1 13Notes 4 Quantum Physics 1 14 Momentum Probability Amplitude Note that 𝐴(𝑘) clearly contains information about momentum because 𝑘 = 𝑝/ℏ. It is useful (later) to be able to describe the state function directly in terms of momentum states. Φ(𝑝) ≡ 1 ℏ 𝐴 𝑝 ℏ (the momentum probability amplitude) Then we can rewrite the wavefunction as; Ψ(𝑥, 0) = 1 2𝜋ℏ න −∞ ∞ Φ(𝑝)𝑒𝑖𝑝𝑥/ℏ𝑑𝑝 and Φ(𝑝) = 1 2𝜋ℏ න −∞ ∞ Ψ(𝑥, 0)𝑒−𝑖𝑝𝑥/ℏ𝑑𝑥. Note that the factor of 1/ ℏ is required for proper normailzation of Ψ and Φ. Operators Mathematically, an operator serves to map a function onto another function: Example: 𝑶𝒐𝒑𝒇 𝒙 = 𝒂𝒇 𝒙 𝟐 + 𝒙 An operator that produces the momentum expectation value from the spatial wavefunction is 𝒑𝒐𝒑 = ℏ 𝒊 𝝏 𝝏𝒙 Kinetic energy: ෠𝑇𝜓 = −ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2 𝜕𝑥2 𝜓 Position: ො𝑥 = 𝑥 Constant: መ𝐶 = 𝐶 Class 6 - Operators and the Schrodinger Equation Quantum Physics 1 15 Eigenvalue Equations • The eigenvalue equation is a special class of operator equation where the operator operating on a function yields the original function times a constant.
