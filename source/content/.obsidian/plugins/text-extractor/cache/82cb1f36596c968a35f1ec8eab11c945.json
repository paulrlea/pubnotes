Problem 1: General physics a) Organic semiconductors offer advantages such as flexibility and biocompatibility but are slower than silicon. Propose a specific application where these advantages outweigh the disadvantages, and justify your choice. [2] b) A polymer chain with alternating single and double bonds has a conjugation length of 10 monomers. How does increasing the conjugation length affect the bandgap of the material? Provide a brief explanation with reference to HOMO and LUMO levels. [2] c) Describe how the presence of polarons in an organic semiconductor affects its optical properties. [2] Problem 2: OLEDs a) Discuss the importance of luminance for OLED performance. [2] b) Assuming that singlet and triplet excitons have the same formation probability, say what is the maximum value of the electroluminescence quantum efficiency in an OLED as a fraction of the photoluminescence quantum efficiency. Assume that radiative transitions are strictly dipole allowed. Explain your reasoning. [3] c) Briefly explain aggregation quenching. [1] d) Suggest how the addition of long alkyl chains in a semiconducting polymer affects charge mobility, PL efficiency and spectrum of emitted light. Consider a HT structure (minimised steric hindrance). [3] Problem 3: OPVs a) Explain the meaning of the so-called “AM1.5 condition” for the measurement of the effi- ciency of solar cells. [2] b) What is the maximum theoretical efficiency of a single junction solar cell? List and briefly describe 3 factors that limit it. [2] 1 Physics of Advanced Materials PHAS0058 c) A photovoltaic device made from an organic semiconductor absorbs photons with an energy of 2 eV. If the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is 60%, calculate the number of electron-hole pairs generated per second when the device is illuminated with a light intensity of 100 mW/cm². Assume 100% absorption for simplicity. [2] d) A solar cell is illuminated with a power of 30 mW of monochromatic light at a wavelength at which the current-voltage characteristic features a fill factor F F = 0.5, a short circuit current ISC = 3 mA, and an open circuit voltage VOC = 1.2 V. (a) Calculate the efficiency of the cell under these conditions. [1] (b) Explain briefly whether or not the result found is plausible for a state-of-the-art organic solar cell. [1] Problem 4: OFETs a) Explain the meaning of the Förster radius as deduced from the mathematical expression below. kET = τ −1 0 × (RF R ) 6 [1] b) Based on the equation in a), calculate a symbolic expression of the donor-acceptor distance at which the energy transfer rate is half the “experimental” radiative decay rate (i.e. not the intrinsic one). [2] c) Calculate this distance for a donor acceptor system for which the Förster radius is 4.5 nm. [2] d) Comment your result and say if it is in agreement with your expectations, and why.
