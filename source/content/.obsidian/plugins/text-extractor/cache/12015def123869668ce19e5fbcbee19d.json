Section 2: Voltage Divider Objective: Create and use a voltage divider for use in section 3, the Op-Amp circuit. Utilize previous circuits knowledge and analyze voltage divider theoretically and experimentally. Equipment: Resistors, Multimeter, Osciliscope, Jumper Cables, 555 Timer circuit from section 1, 9v battery and harness. Procedure: Perform calculations to determine theoretical voltage attenuation given certian resistors value. Target for voltage attenuation is 10x. Use breadboard, resistors, and jumpers to create circuit outlined in diagram above. Apply voltage and use multimeter to verrify the calculated voltage attenuation is accurate. Beginning with the target attenuation (10x), we can calculate the ratio of resistance we need. $$ ElectronicsLab - Jupyter Notebook http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Documents/School/ExPhys/E... 7 of 15 6/10/24, 19:48 V_(out) = \\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} \\cdot V_(in) $$ Rearrange to solve for attenuation Rearrange this to solve for the required resistance This is the required ratio between our two resistors.

You can clearly see the attenuation, however, the scaling on channel 2 was increased relative to channel 1 to retain clarity. Measurements of with a steady power supply yielded an experimental of 0.951 volts, with a of 9.60 volts. Analysis: Looking at these results, we can easily calculate the experimentally measured attenuation. With a of 9.60 and a of 0.951, gain is calculated by: As seen here, the experimental value matched the theorized value for our measured resistances to the extent of the accuracy of our measuring equipment. Conclusions: This experiment veriﬁed that the experimentally measured attenuation matched the theoretically calculated attenuation to the highest accuracy we could measure with our lab equipment. We were not able to perfectly match our goal of 10x attenuation due to a lack of properly matched resistors.

Equipment: ElectronicsLab - Jupyter Notebook http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Documents/School/ExPhys/E... 9 of 15 6/10/24, 19:48 T-I Op-amp chip, breadboard, circuits from Section 1 and 2, oscilloscope, multi- meter, pair of resistors to yield desired gain and 9v power supply. Procedure: First begin by calculating the appropriate gain while taking care to ensure that the ampliﬁer is not being pushed beyond its limits. Since section 2 yielded an attenuation of 10x, the operational ampliﬁer circuit has to have a less then 10x gain. To achieve this, a pair of resistors has to follow the following relation: Where and are labeled in the diagram below ![Pasted image 20240609115252.png](<attachment:Pasted image 20240609115252.png>) After computing the theoretical gain from the resistors, we can proceed to compute the experimental gain.

This evidence veriﬁes the operation of the inverting Op-Amp circuit being regulated by the equations stated above. Analytical Design Problem: Given this non-inverting ampliﬁer circuit, we need to ﬁnd how to calculate the gain based on values of and . We can accomplish this using the golden rules: 1.

Using golden rule #1 we were able to derive the gain from the circuit design by treating it as a potential divider in reverse. Section 4 Objective: The objective of this section was to combine passive elements such as capacitors and inductors to create a low-pass frequency ﬁlter. This will build upon the previous sections, using the ampliﬁed signal from section 3 as an input. Equipment: Previously built circuits, capacitors, resistors, multi-meter, oscilloscope, jumper wires, 9v power supply. Procedure: To create and test this low pass ﬁlter, we need to combine a resistor and a capacitor in the diagram shown below: ![Pasted image 20240610151757.png](<attachment:Pasted image 20240610151757.png>) The problem gives us values to use for the capacitor and resistor, 47 and 4.7 respectively. We will ﬁrst calculate the theoretical voltage attenuation at 100Hz and 10kHz. After performing these calculations, we next must experimentally verify them. However, we are not given a 47 capacitor, but we have 95 capacitors. We can combine 2 95 capacitors in series to achieve our desired capacitance. Using these components and building the circuit, the next step is to connect the output of section 3 into the of the low pass ﬁlter. Next, we are to test the circuit with a 100Hz signal and a 10kHz signal. Finally, we will take measurements and compare this to our theoretical ﬁndings.
