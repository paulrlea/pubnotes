Solutions for the Schrodinger equation curve toward the x-axis in classically allowed 𝐸 > 𝑉 regions and away from the axis in classically forbidden regions. 2. For bound states, the wavefunction must go to zero for large distances outside the well. (must be normalizable) 3. Curvature increases for larger 𝐸 − 𝑉(𝑥) . 4. Solutions are continuous and smooth if the potential has no infinite steps. 5. Energy eigenfunctions have an integer number of antinodes on classically allowed regions. 6. The wavefunction amplitude is usually larger in regions with small E>V. * From https:’’www.asc.ohio-state.edu/physics/ntg/H133/handouts/wavefunctions.pdf 6Quantum Physics 1 - Persans Illustrated “intuitive” rules 7 * from Townsend Ch 4 1.

Quantum Physics 1 - PersansQuantum Physics 1 - Persans 9 from Eisberg and Resnick Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 10 The Finite Square Well Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 11 𝜓(𝑥) = 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 + 𝐷𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < − 𝑎 2 𝐴 sin 𝑘 𝑥 + 𝐵 cos 𝑘 𝑥 for − 𝑎 2 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 2 𝐹𝑒𝐾𝑥 + 𝐺𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 > 𝑎 2 where 𝑘 = 2𝑚𝐸 ℏ and 𝐾 = 2𝑚 𝑉0−𝐸 ℏ 𝑉(𝑥) = ቐ0 ; − 𝑎 2 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 2 1; 𝑥 > 𝑎 2 Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 12 We can guess that the solutions will look like those of the infinite square well, but with relaxed decay at the boundaries Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 13 The physical requirement that the wavefunction must be normalizable means that it cannot blow up at ±∞, 𝑠𝑜 𝜓(𝑥) = 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < − 𝑎 2 𝐴 sin 𝑘 𝑥 + 𝐵 cos 𝑘 𝑥 for − 𝑎 2 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 2 𝐺𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 > 𝑎 2 Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 14 Symmetry of the potential leads to the requirement that the probability density for an eigenfunction be an even function of x. This leads to the requirement that the eigenfunctions be either even or odd. 𝜓𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛(𝑥) = 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < − 𝑎 2 𝐵 cos 𝑘 𝑥 for − 𝑎 2 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 2 𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 > 𝑎 2 (Note that we set C=G.) 𝜓𝑜𝑑𝑑(𝑥) = 𝐶𝑒𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 < − 𝑎 2 𝐵 sin 𝑘𝑥 for − 𝑎 2 < 𝑥 < 𝑎 2 −𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑥 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 > 𝑎 2 (Note that we set C=-G.) Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 15 Now we use the physical properties of the wavefunction at the boundaries to find the constants B and C, and the energies. Considering the even solutions first: 1) The wavefunction must be continuous at the boundary at +a/2 and –a/2. For x=-a/2 and +a/2: 𝐵 cos 𝑘𝑎 2 = 𝐶𝑒−𝐾𝑎 2 2) The derivative of the wavefunction must be continuous at the boundaries. For x=-a/2 and +a/2: 𝐵𝑘 sin 𝑘𝑎 2 = 𝐶𝐾𝑒−𝐾𝑎 2 Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 16 And dividing eq 2 by eq 1: (𝑘 sin 𝑘𝑎 2 )/(cos 𝑘𝑎 2 ) = 𝐾 𝑘 tan 𝑘𝑎 2 = 𝐾 Similarly, for the odd parity states, (𝑘 cos 𝑘𝑎 2 )/(−sin 𝑘𝑎 2 ) = 𝐾 𝑘 cot 𝑘𝑎 2 = −𝐾 These equations are transcendental equations that cannot be solved in closed form, but can be solved numerically. A graphical approach yields insight. Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 17 From these equations alone, we can find the allowed energies: K k = tan 𝑘𝐿 2 for odd n (even parity) K k = − cot 𝑘𝐿 2 for even n (odd parity) The even parity state will be the lowest energy state. These equations cannot be solved in closed form, but we can find the numerical solutions using \"solve\" in Maple or by plotting each side as a function of k. On the next slide we′ll switch to terms of energy because everyone does. Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 18 Let 𝜉 = 𝑘𝑎 2 (a measure of kinetic energy in the well) 𝜉0 = 𝑎 ℏ 𝑚𝑉 2 (a measure of the depth of the well) Then tan 𝜉 = 𝜉0 2 − 𝜉2 𝜉 −cot 𝜉 = 𝜉0 2 − 𝜉2 𝜉 Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 19 Even solutions: Plot both the left hand and right hand side of tan 𝜉 = 𝜉0 2−𝜉2 𝜉 as a function of 𝜉. • Intersections are allowed energies • tan 𝜉 goes to ∞ each time 𝜉 goes through odd 𝜋 2. • If well depth is small, then only one solution can be found. • If well depth is large, solutions approach infinite well. Quantum Physics 1 - Persans 20 Odd solutions: Plot both the left hand and right hand side of − cot 𝜉 = 𝜉0 2−𝜉2 𝜉 as a function of 𝜉. • Intersections are allowed energies • −cot 𝜉 goes to ∞ each time 𝜉 goes through even 𝜋 2. • If well depth is small, then only no solution can be found. • If well depth is large, solutions approach infinite well.

The only parameter with which to achieve agreement of the wavefunction with expected behavior is 𝐸. 25 The starting point • We can choose the starting point based on symmetry. • For the finite well, even solutions have zero slope at the center. (Let’s take 0= 1=1.) • Expected asymptotic behavior: For z growing to large values (outside the well) we expect the wavefunction to go to zero. • Now we will go to the Jupyter Notebook: The+Shooting+Method+for+solving+finite+well.ipynb The Dirac Delta Function • Definition: ׬−∞ ∞ 𝛿 𝑥 − 𝑥0 𝑓 𝑥 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑥0 • 𝛿 𝑥 − 𝑥0 = ቊ 0 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 ≠ 𝑥0 ∞ 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑥 = 𝑥0 • ׬ 𝛿 𝑥 − 𝑥0 𝑑𝑥 = 1 • 𝛿 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 • 𝛿 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 26 Some Dirac Delta Representations • 𝛿 𝑥 = 𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝛼 → ∞ 𝛼 𝜋 𝑒−𝛼𝑥2 • 𝛿 𝑥 = 𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝛼 → 0 1 𝜋 𝛼 𝑥2+𝛼2 • 𝛿 𝑥 = 𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝛼 → 0 1 𝜋 sin𝑥 𝛼 𝑥 • 𝛿 𝑥 = 1 2𝜋 ׬−∞ ∞ 𝑒−𝑖𝑘𝑥𝑑𝑥 2728 The delta function potential http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/751.mf1i.fall02/OneDimSchr.htm 22 2 ˆˆ () 2 HE xE mx      =  − + = with negative, for an attractive potential. 29 𝜓 = 𝐴𝑒𝐾𝑥 + 𝐵𝑒−𝐾𝑥 So for negative x, 𝜓− = 𝐴𝑒𝐾𝑥 and for positive x, 𝜓+ = 𝐵𝑒−𝐾𝑥 Continuity of the wavefunction gives 𝜓− = 𝜓+ 𝑠𝑜 𝐴 = 𝐵.
