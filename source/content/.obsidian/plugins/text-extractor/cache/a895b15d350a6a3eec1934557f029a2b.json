Φ1 = 𝑀𝑖2 3 Example: Self-Inductance of a Solenoid • Calculate the self-inductance (often just called the inductance) 𝐿 of an ideal solenoid of 𝑁 turns, length 𝑙, and radius 𝑟𝑠 : 𝐿𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 = Φ𝐵,𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝑖 = Φ𝐵,𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝑖 = 𝐵𝐴𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝑖 𝐿𝑁𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 = 𝑁 𝜇𝑜𝑛𝑖 𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝 𝑖 ⇒ 𝐿𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑑 = 𝜇0𝑁 𝑁 𝑙 𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝 = 𝜇0𝑁2𝜋𝑟𝑠 2 𝑙 = 𝜋𝜇0𝑛2𝑟𝑠 2𝑙 , Φ𝐵,𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝 = flux through a single turn, and 𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝 = 𝜋𝑟𝑠 2 = area of a turn. • 𝐿 is independent of current or magnetic field of the solenoid. • SI unit of inductance is the Henry (H)*: 1 H = 1 Wb/A = 1 T m2/A . *ask for a Albany-Troy story 4 𝑩 𝑟𝑠 Example: Self-Inductance of a Solenoid (2) • To get a sense of a typical inductance value, an inductor in an electrical circuit might have 1000 turns, a radius of 0.50 cm, and a length of 1.0 cm: 𝐿 = 𝜋 4𝜋×10−7T m A 1000 2 (0.01 m) 0.0050 m 2 = 9.9 × 10−3 H. 5 𝑩 𝑟𝑠 Activity: Self-Inductance of a coaxial cable • Determine the inductance of a one meter segment of a long straight coaxial cable. (See activity instructions) • The inner wire diameter d is 0.80 mm. The diameter D of the inside surface of the outer conductor is 5.0 mm. The insulator is non-magnetic. 6 D d Inductance and EMF • Differentiating the inductance – current relation gives 𝑑Φ𝐵 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑑 𝑑𝑡 𝐿𝑖 = 𝐿 𝑑𝑖 𝑑𝑡 , Combined with Faraday’s law, yields: EL = −𝐿 𝑑𝑖 𝑑𝑡 . • When current changes in an inductor, an emf is induced that opposes the imposed change (Lenz’s law). • Physical consequence: when current is turned on or off in a circuit (e.g., closing a switch), a “back emf” EL is generated in the inductor that opposes that change. If the change in current is sudden, the back emf can be quite large in magnitude! 7 Lecture Question • An ideal solenoid has length 𝑙 = 1.5 cm, cross-sectional area 𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝 = 0.78 cm2, and number of turns 𝑁 = 2500. At time 𝑡 = 0.0 s a steady current 𝑖0 = 2.0 A flows through the solenoid. Suppose the current were to be cutoff as shown in the graph at right. (This is consistent with pulling a power supply plug from the wall.) The magnitude of the emf induced in the inductor is closest to: A. 1.2 × 105 V. B. 1.3 × 103 V. C. 21 V. D. 1.6 × 104 V.

Change in Potential Across an Inductor (2) • Ideal inductors are made of conductors with effectively zero resistance. To have finite current density in this type of inductor, the total electric field that acts on charges inside the conductor must be essentially zero: 𝑬𝑡𝑜𝑡 = 𝑬𝑐 + 𝑬𝑛𝑐 = 0 ⇒ 𝑬𝑐 = −𝑬𝑛𝑐 . • ∴ Conservative electric field 𝑬𝑐 in the inductor is opposite in direction and has same magnitude as the induced non-conservative field, 𝑬𝑛𝑐. 12 • Electric potential is defined in terms of conservative electric fields; follows that potential difference between inductor leads is 𝑉 𝑏 − 𝑉 𝑎 = − ׬𝑎 𝑏 𝑬𝑐 ⋅ 𝑑Ԧ𝒍 = ׬𝑎 𝑏 𝑬𝑛𝑐 ⋅ 𝑑Ԧ𝒍 = −𝐿 𝑑𝑖 𝑑𝑡 ⇒ 𝑉 𝑎 − 𝑉 𝑏 = 𝐿 𝑑𝑖 𝑑𝑡 . Inductors in Circuits 13 • Circuit shown: box enables us to control the current 𝑖 in the circuit. • Potential difference between the terminals of the inductor 𝐿 is: 𝑉𝑎𝑏 = 𝑉(𝑎) − 𝑉(𝑏) = 𝐿 𝑑𝑖 𝑑𝑡 . • Consider inductor response for different situations. Inductors in Circuits (2) 14 • For resistors in circuits, flow shown above is always a drop in potential across a resistor. • Result for an inductor in a circuit will depend on how the current is changing with time. Inductors in Circuits (3) 15 • Steady (i.e., constant) current: no emf and no potential difference across the inductor. Inductors in Circuits (4) 16 • Current increasing in the direction of the current: induced back-emf in circuit opposes increase of the current in sense shown. ➢ For this case, emf due to 𝑬𝑛𝑐 in the inductor is directed from terminal 𝑏 to terminal 𝑎. ➢ Conservative electric field 𝑬𝑐 in the inductor is directed oppositely, from terminal 𝑎 to terminal 𝑏. ➢ Conservative electric fields point from high electric potential to low electric potential: follows that 𝑉 𝑎 > 𝑉 𝑏 ⇒ 𝑉𝑎𝑏 > 0. Inductors in Circuits (5) 17 • Current decreasing with time in the direction of the current. ➢ Emf of the inductor tries to replenish (i.e., add to) diminishing current in the sense shown, going from 𝑎 to 𝑏.  𝑬𝑛𝑐 for this case goes from 𝑎 to 𝑏. ➢ Conservative electric field 𝑬𝑐 is oppositely directed, from 𝑏 to 𝑎. ➢ Follows that 𝑉 𝑏 > 𝑉(𝑎) for this case. That is, 𝑉𝑎𝑏 < 0. Inductors in Circuits – Remembering the emf sign • It can help to think of the potential induced by the changing current in the inductor as the potential necessary to maintain the current in the rest of the circuit. • If current in the inductor is decreasing, the inductor will try to keep the current going in the rest of the circuit like a battery. 18 Load Load Magnetic Energy Stored in Inductors 19 • When inductor voltage 𝑉𝑎𝑏 ≠ 0 and current 𝑖 ≠ 0, power can be supplied to an inductor. Amount of power will be 𝑃𝐿 = 𝑖 𝑉𝑎𝑏 = 𝑖𝐿 𝑑𝑖 𝑑𝑡 . • Energy stored in the inductor as magnetic energy found by integrating supplied power over time: 𝑈𝐵 = ׬ 𝑃𝐿 𝑑𝑡 = ׬ 𝑖𝐿 𝑑𝑖 𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑡 = 𝐿 ׬0 𝑖 𝑖′𝑑𝑖′ = 1 2 𝐿𝑖2 . ➢ Unlike a resistor, where energy is dissipated (i.e., lost from system), power 𝑃𝐿 to the inductor is stored as energy in the magnetic field of the inductor. ➢ If current in the circuit 𝑖 → 0, stored magnetic energy is returned to the circuit. Energy Density of the Magnetic Field 20 • Similar to electrostatics, define the energy density of a magnetic field as 𝑢𝐵 ≡ 𝑈𝐵 𝑣 , where 𝑣 = volume of a system. • For a solenoid of length 𝑙 and cylindrical cross-section area 𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝, 𝑣 = 𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑙 = 𝜋𝑟𝑠 2𝑙, 𝐵 = 𝜇0𝑛𝑖, and 𝐿 = 𝜋𝜇0𝑛2𝑟𝑠 2𝑙. Follows that 𝑢𝐵 = 1 2𝐿𝑖2 𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑙 = 1 2 (𝜇0𝜋𝑟𝑠 2𝑛2𝑙)𝑖2 𝜋𝑟𝑠 2𝑙 = 1 2 𝜇0 𝑛𝑖 2 = 1 2 𝜇0 𝐵 𝜇0 2 , ⇒ 𝑢𝐵 = 𝐵2 2 𝜇0 . • Although derived for a solenoid, expression found for 𝑢𝐵 is independent of any device. Above relation is true for all situations. Energy Density of the Magnetic Field (2) 21 • Energy density 𝑢𝐵 can be considered an intrinsic property of a magnetic field. Similar to that for the energy density of the electric field, 𝑢𝐸 = 1 2 𝜖0𝐸2. • SI units of energy density 𝑢𝐵 are J m3 . This is equivalent to N m2 . These units are the same as for pressure. • Energy densities 𝑢𝐵 and 𝑢𝐸 naturally appear in the discussion of wave energy and momentum of electromagnetic waves (light). Mutual Inductance 22 • Inductance effects not limited to emf effect of a device on itself. Inductance can also occur between different devices. In those cases we refer to there being a mutual inductance. • Consider two separate, yet nearby coils: magnetic field of one can create a magnetic flux in the other (and vice-versa). Change of the magnetic field in one (by a change in its current) can induce a change in the magnetic flux of the other ⇒ one coil induces emf in the other. Mutual Inductance (2) 23 • Consider two neighboring coils of wire. If current in coil 1 changes, it induces an emf in coil 2, and vice versa. • Proportionality constant for this pair of coils is the mutual inductance, 𝑀. • Define mutual inductance of coil 2 with respect to coil 1 as 𝑀21 = 𝑁2Φ𝐵2 𝑖1 , and that of coil 1 with respect to coil 2 as 𝑀12 = 𝑁1Φ𝐵1 𝑖2 . • Being inductances, mutual inductances 𝑀21 and 𝑀12 are independent of magnetic field and current in either coil. They depend only on the geometry of the coils and physical constants. Mutual Inductance (3) 24 • From their definitions, it follows that coil emfs are E1 = −𝑁1 𝑑Φ𝐵1 𝑑𝑡 = −𝑀12 𝑑𝑖2 𝑑𝑡 , E2 = −𝑁2 𝑑Φ𝐵2 𝑑𝑡 = −𝑀21 𝑑𝑖1 𝑑𝑡 . • With a little more detail and math than we will be using in PHYS 1200, one can show from general considerations that there exists a reciprocity relation, such that, for general loop circuits 1 and 2, 𝑀12 = 𝑀21 = 𝑀 , and from which it follows for the magnetically linked coils, E1 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖2 𝑑𝑡 , E2 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖1 𝑑𝑡 .","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
