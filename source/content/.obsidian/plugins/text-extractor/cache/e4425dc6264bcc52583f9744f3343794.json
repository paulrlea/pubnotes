This is not intended to be a comprehensive list. If you are unsure about something, ask your lab instructor or lecturer. Not cheating: Most learning is done through discussion with your peers and instructors. It is encouraged. Students are expected to actively participate in a collaborative group when working on the in-class activity. Discussion with peers or instructors is encouraged. Discussion with peers or instructors on homework is encouraged. Cheating: Each student must turn in her/his own activity write-up. No student will be allowed to submit an activity in the name of any other student. The same policy applies to homework and in-class assignments. If you are caught copying or handing in work that is not your own, you will receive a non-droppable zero for that assignment and will be warned that this is not acceptable behavior. If unacceptable behavior persists after warning, it may result in an F for the course and a letter to the Dean of Students. Collaboration (giving or taking information) or copying of any sort or using any aid that is not allowed during an exam is cheating. It will result in immediate failure and a letter to the Dean of Students. Altering a returned exam and asking for a re-grade is cheating. If you become aware of another student cheating on an exam or in any other aspect of the course, it is your responsibility and also in your best interests to inform the professor so that appropriate action may be taken. The reputation of Rensselaer as a premiere institute of research and learning rests on the integrity of its students, faculty, and staff. If you have any question concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clari6fication.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
