Section 1 The primary research objective of this lab was to produce an accurate measurement for muon lifetimes on earth's surface. Secondary objectives included verrifiyng the lab's equipment for this project through testing frequency response, saturation voltage, FPGA response time and discriminator functionality . Additionally , we used the derived muon lifetimes to derive the Fermi coupling constant as well as the ratio of positive to negative muons. Sectio n 1 : Freq uen cy Resp o n se The objective of this section was to verrify the frequency response of the amplifier over the range of frequencies we will need for this experiment. Eq uip men t: Muon physics electronics box Oscilliscope Pro cedure Applied various frequency 100mV peak-to-peak sine wave from a Function Generator to the PMT Input of the electronics box. Measured the Amplifier Output and calculated the ratio V out/V in, representing the amplifier's gain, for each frequency tested. Accounted for the attenuation resistors between the amplifier output and the front panel connector by multiplying this ratio by 21 (1050/50), considering a 1% uncertainty in this factor , to determine the actual amplifier gain. D a ta The matrepr extension is already loaded. To reload it, use: %reload_ext matrepr Figure 1: Plot of Gain vs Frequency A n a ly sis: The frequency response for this amplifier circuit is very flat. Throughout the 50kHz-1mHz range, the response remains identical. It is hard to estimate the exact maximum decay rate, but it is likely well in excess of 1 megahertz, or much less then 1 microsecond. C o n clusio n s: The frequency response of the amplifier is very flat. There is a constant and steady gain of 1 throughout the 50kHz to 1mHz regime. This is expected and beneficial to our experiements occuring later on. Sectio n 2 : Sa tura tio n o utp ut vo lta ge The objective of this portion of the lab was to determine the saturation voltage for our amplifier used in this exeperiment. Eq uip men t Oscilliscope Muon electronics box Pro cedure Applied various voltage 100kHz sine waves from a Function Generator to the PMT Input of the electronics box. Took measurements of each peak-peak output voltage for each input voltage Noted any fallof f points or discrepancies D a ta Figure 2: Plot of output voltage as a function of input voltage Figure 3: Gain as a function of input voltage A n a ly sis: Voltage saturation began to occur above 100mv . The effect was slight though, and the amplifier continued to perform moderately well past its saturation point. The FPGA did not appear to be af fected, and the waveforms appeared to qualtiatively be in sync. C o n clusio n s The amplifier performed as expected, with voltage gain dropof f occuring above 100mv . The gain calculated resulted in larger errors towards the higher end of the voltage spectrum due to error propagation between input voltage and output voltage. Sectio n 3 : D iscrimin a to r The objective of this section was to examine the behavior of the discriminator function of the Muon Physics electronics setup. This was acomplished by adjusting the threshold value and observing the changes in the time difference. Eq uip men t Oscilliscope Muon electronics box Digital Multimeter Pro cedure Applied a 100kHz 100mV sine signal into the PMT input of the elctronics box. Adjusted the descriminator threshold to various levels and observed the behavior recoreded on oscilliscope. Used oscilliscope to measure time interval and voltage max using cursor search feature. Repeated for every discriminator value D a ta Figure 4: T ime difference as a function of Descriminator V oltage Figure 5 Amplifier voltage on rising edge as a function of discriminator voltage Figure 6: Single discriminator and amplifier signal waveform Figure 7: Several discriminator and amplifier signal waveforms A n a ly sis: This section detailed the usage of the descriminator , and its sensitivity to voltage fluctuation. By setting the threshold at any level desired, it allows an arbitrary waveform to be converted into a series of pulses. C o n clusio n : The descriminator functioned as intended. The waveforms qualitatively looked good and had sharp rising and falling edges. The time dif ference and amplifier voltage were roughly linear , and error in those may be due to the inpercision of the oscilliscope cursors. Sectio n 4 : Timin g p ro p erties o f FPGA The objective of this section was to verrify the properties of the FPGA communication interface with the PC used to record muon events later on. Importantly , we determined the maximum and minimum event times observable by the computer . Eq uip men t Oscilliscope Muon electronics box Scintillator (and LED pulser) Desktop with Muon software Digital Multimeter Pro cedure We switched from using the function generator to using the pulse input of the scintillator tube. Measured the time between successive pulses using the cursors on the oscilliscope. Next, we repeated this same measurement using the computer interface. These measurements were repeated for various values of pulse length, from 0.5us to 20us. D a ta Figure 8: Oscilliscope timings vs Computer timings with a linear curve fit All points greater then 30us were trimmed out to remove sources of interference. The detector appears to reach a timeout at 40us. A n a ly sis: The maximum event time appears to be 40100 ns, or 40.1 us. This would corrospond to the timeout time mentioned in the literature. The minimum event time is shorter then the first data point 0.5us, as linearity was preserved throughout the range of pulse times tested. C o n clusio n s: The FPGA's response range was satisfactory . All muon events relayed to the FPGA should be able to be recorded via the computer interface. The response compared to the oscilliscope is highly linear , with a slope of 1.003. The error of 0.003 was more likely due to oscilliscope cursor error , as it was dif ficult to align the oscilliscope cursors at the exact same point each time. Sectio n 5 :Muo n Phy sics The objective of this portion of the lab was to measure the lifespan of a muon on earth. These results would then be used to calculate the Fermi constant as well as the ratio of positive to negative muons. Eq uip men t Oscilliscope Muon electronics box Scintillator Desktop with Muon software Digital Multimeter Pro cedure Configured the discriminator of the muon electronics box to 210mV Adjusted the HV input of the scintillator to 700V Connected the Scintillator , Muon box, and computer . Figure 9: Configuration of Scintillator , Muon electronics box, and Desktop PC Began data collection on the computer Waited 30 minutes, and verrified data collected matched the expected Muon spectrum. Waited ~3 days for data to be collected, returned and uploaded data onto personal computers. D a ta Data was collected over a slightly less then 3 day period.

This ratio is given by: Where is the decay rate of positively charged muons, identical to the free-space decay rate . is the decay time of negatively charged muons, which decay faster in matter .

Our values for muon lifetime were slightly lower then expected but this can also be attributed to negative muons decaying in matter quicker . If we were able to detect muons in free space, we would be able to derive the free space Muon decay time. Our best fitting muon decay time using method 1 was 2382.9163 ± 196.2220 nanoseconds, with a reduced chi squared of 1.61. This is within uncertainty of the literature value of muon lifetime, however , knowing that the detected muon lifetime should be slightly less, this is slightly of f. An explanation for this is the approach utilized a flat rate error , which heavily weighted bins with fewer data-points. In an exponentially decaying model like this one, this means that the higher-value bins were much more heavily weighted, increasing the overall calculated muon lifetime. Using a much better approach, taking the standard deviation of each bin, we derived a muon decay time of 2173.951 29.538 nanoseconds, slightly below the free space lifetime as predicted. However , despite this, we had a highly over-constrained graph due to the large errors in the latter part of the spectrum. This is evidenced by the derived reduced chi squared of 0.002. Using this second value, we calculated the Fermi constant and muon ratio . These values were respectively calculated at and , both falling within literature estimated values. The Muon ratio had a large error due to all three muon decay times, both given and derived, having non-negligible errors, resulting in a relatively large propagated error . ρ = 5.8249714472 Δρ = √( Δt) 2 + ( Δtp) 2 + ( Δtm) 2 =        ⎷ ((−(tp ∗ 1/tm/(tp − t) 2 ∗ (tm − tp))) ⋅ Δt)2 + ((tp ∗ 1/tm/(tp − t) 2 ∗ (tm − t) − (tm − t) ∗ 1/tm/(tp − t) 1) ⋅ Δtp)2 + ((tp ∗ 1/(tp − t)/tm2 ∗ (tm − t) − tp ∗ 1/(tp − t)/tm1) ⋅ Δtm)2 = 8.3391551635 = 8.3391551635 × 10 0 = 8 × 10 0 ∂ρ ∂t ∂ρ ∂tp ∂ρ ∂tm ρ = 6 ± 8 ± ρ = (1.19 ± 0.08) × 10 −5GF (ℏc)3 ρ = 6 ± 8","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
