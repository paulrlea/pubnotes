Show that for G = SU (5), the anomaly cancels between the 5∗ and the 10. Note that for SU (N), we can, with no loss of generality , take A, B, and C to be the same, so that the anomaly is determined by the trace of a generator cubed (namely, TrT 3 ). It is rare that we get something cubed in physics, and so any cancellation between irreducible representations can hardly be accidental. Easiest to use diagonal generator . T = diag ( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 , − 1 2 , − 1 2 ) Taking this diagonal generator , we evaluate the trace of the generator cubed in the 5* dimensional representation. All entries are real: (multiply by 6) T ∗ = diag (2, 2, 2, −3, −3) Cubing this matrix: T ∗3 = diag (8, 8, 8, −27, −27) Taking the trace: Tr(T ∗3) = −30 Now for the 10-dimensional representation: Basis for 10-d representation: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5) Converting the 5-d diagonal matrix to a 10-d representation T10 d = diag(d1 + d2, d1 + d3, d1 + d4, d1 + d5, d2 + d3, d2 + d4, d2 + d5, d3 + d4, d3 + d5, d4 + d5) T10 d = diag(4, 4, −1, −1, 4, −1, −1, −1, −1, −6) Cubing this diagonal matrix: T 3 10 d = diag(64, 64, −1, −1, 64, −1, −1, −1, −1, −216) Taking the trace: TrT 3 10 d = 3(64) − 222 = 192 − 222 = −30 30 − (−30) = 0 Problem 3 N9.3 Work out how the 3-indexed antisymmetric 10 dimensional tensor in SO(10) decomposes on restriction to SO(4) ⊗ SO(6). Decomposing Using the following equation (credit Nate Laposky and Hannah Turner) Λ3(V ⊕ W ) = Λ3(V ) ⊕ (Λ2(V ) ⊗ W ) ⊕ (V ⊗ Λ2(W )) ⊕ Λ3(W ) We can plug in our representations: Λ3(10) = Λ3(4, 1) ⊕ (Λ2(4, 1) ⊗ (1, 6)) ⊕ ((4, 1) ⊗ Λ2(1, 6)) ⊕ Λ3(1, 6) And from this we can start pulling out our representations: We have a (4,1) representation from Λ3(4, 1) From (Λ2(4, 1) ⊗ (1, 6)) we get (6, 6) From ((4, 1) ⊗ Λ2(1, 6)) we get Λ2(6) ≅15 → (4, 15) From Λ3(1, 6) we get the 20 dimensional representation of SO(6) (1, 20) Decomposing Using the following equation (credit Nate Laposky and Hannah Turner) 3 indexed antisymmetric 10-d tensor has 120 elements.
