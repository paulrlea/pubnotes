IMPORTANT NOTE: Only 2 of these problems will be graded for credit (at 10 points each)!! We will not disclose which problems are being graded before the deadline. This means that you will need to submit completed answers to all questions or risk getting a 0 if we grade a problem you didn’t do. 1. Three oscillators of equal mass, m, are coupled such that the potential energy of the system is given by:  )()( 2 1 32213 2 22 2 3 2 11 xxxxkxkxxkU ++++= with 213 2 kkk = . (a) Calculate the eigenfrequencies of the system. (b) What is the physical interpretation of the zero-frequency mode? 2. Two equal masses, m, are constrained to move on a frictionless plane, one on the positive x axis and one on the positive y axis. They are attached to two identical springs, with force constant k, whose other ends are attached to the origin. In addition, the two masses are connected to each other by a third spring with force constant k12. The springs are chosen so that the system is in equilibrium with all three springs relaxed (length equal to rest length). Consider a small displacement of the masses from the equilibrium position. a) What are the eigenfrequencies? b) Find the eigenvectors of the system. c) Describe (using words) the 2 normal modes of the system. 3. Consider a system of carts and springs like that in Figure 1 EXCEPT that there are three equal-mass carts and four identical springs. Solve for the three eigenfrequencies, the three eigenvectors, and describe the motion (using words) of the corresponding normal modes. Figure 1","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
