SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 An alo g Co mp uter Theo ry When we think of computers we think of digital computers, which store and manipulate discrete data in binary form. Analog computers use any set of electrical and mechanical properties to model solutions to problems. By using the electrical properties of circuits, we can model differential equations as a rate of change in voltage. Op -Amp s ( Op eratio n al Amp lifier) An op-amp has two voltage inputs: one positive (V+) non-inverting input, one negative (V -) inverting input; two power inputs: one positive (V S+), one negative (V S-); and a voltage output (V o ut), shown in figure 1. Figure 1: Basic op-amp symbol Recall ‚Äú The Golden Rules‚Äù for understanding Op-Amp operation with external feedback (from Electronic Lab documentation): Here are some simple rules for working out op-amp behavior with external feedback: First, the gain of the op-amp (open loop i.e. without feedback - ref. Figure 1) is so high that a fraction of a millivolt between its input terminals will swing the output over its full range. If the non-inverting (+) input is grounded, and the inverting (-) input has a small positive input voltage, the op-amp will output -9V ( if +/-9V ar e applied to the power terminals ), because the voltage difference is positive and applied to the non-inverting input. Open-loop circuits are valuable in electronics when measuring high and low signals, where high and low ef fectively correspond to ON and OFF states, respectively , but for our application, closed-loop circuits are much more SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 valuable. GOLDEN RULE 1 : The output attempts to do whatever is necessary to make the voltage difference between the inputs zero Second, op-amps draw very little input current. GOLDEN RULE 2 : The inputs (both the inverting and non-inverting) draw no current Op-amps have two powering terminals - for our lab, these are +9V and -9V using the rechargeable batteries. ( Note: Ther e is a voltage range for powering the terminals. In general, you will need to look up the datasheet for the specific op-amp to identify the range but for this lab, the +/-9V is valid for all the Op-Amps that ar e found in the lab ). Inv erting A mplifier Closed loop circuits include a feedback loop from the output, typically to the negative input.The behavior of the inverting op-amp was covered in our earlier Electronic Lab. A negative feedback, closed-loop circuit is shown in figure 2, where R_f is the mechanism of the feedback. Figure 2: closed-loop circuit In a closed-loop circuit, the op-amp adjusts output voltage such that the input voltage in both inputs are close to the same, meaning when is grounded, and therefore is equal to zero, theùëâ+ op-amp will decrease the potential dif ference of such that it too will go to zero. This satisfiesùëâ‚àí SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 the rule that current cannot flow into the input terminals. The current, Iin , into the input resistor R_in therefore must be the same as the current, If , in the feedback resistor R_f according to Kirchhof f‚Äôs current law . Notice the use of Ohm‚Äô s Law. Changing the values of R_in and R_f allows us to change the output voltage accordingly . Notice that if R_in = R_f , then V_out = -V_in , which is why this circuit is known as an inverting circuit. Integrating A mplifier By using a reactive element in the feedback loop of the op-amp, one can develop an integrator (figure 3). In this case, the feedback is performed with a capacitor . Figure 3 : In tegratin g Amp lifier SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 The curren t flo win g thro ugh the cap acito r fo llo ws a similar an alysis as fo r the in vertin g amp lifier ( figure 2 ) . Ho wever, un like the resisto r, this feedback curren t, If , gen erates a chan ge in the vo ltage acro ss the cap acito r which is essen tially C.dV_ o ut/dt. D ifferentiating A mplifier Fo r differen tiatin g amp lifiers, the cap acito r is n o w at the in p ut o f the o p -amp an d the resisto r is used as the feedback elemen t. Figure 4 sho ws the circuit o f an o p -amp p erfo rmin g differen tiatio n o f the in p ut sign al, V_ in . Figure 4 : Differen tiatin g Amp lifier Now the input current, Iin , is driven by the rate of change of input voltage V_in across the capacitor , C. SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 Summing A mplifier Op-amps can also be used for voltage addition following the same application of Kirchhof f‚Äôs current law in a closed-loop, negative feedback circuit. The current flowing in the feedback loop, If , is the sum of the individual currents that make up Iin . Notice below , the voltage is summed and inverted. Inversion is a small price to pay for the simplicity of a negative feedback loop circuit, as opposed to a positive feedback loop circuit, which will not be discussed in this lab. Inversion and addition are shown in figure 5: Figure 5: Example of a summing amplifier with two inputs. SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 Input and output voltages are variables; for the harmonic oscillator , the input voltage is the initial displacement of the mass. The computer solution is simply a voltage waveform whose time dependency is the same as that of the desired variable. Curve fittin g fo r exp o n en tially decayin g sin e curves All of the fits in this lab can be modelled using the product of a sine function and an exponential term. This kind of curve fit therefore requires five fit parameters: the amplitude, the voltage of fset, the frequency and phase of the sign, and the constant in the exponential term. The scipy .odr curve fit is able to determine all parameters within one fit very efficiently . Remember to include the number of parameters as degrees of freedom when computing chi squared . If you get a fit that is obviously very wrong, include an argument with an array of initial guesses to the argument of the fit function, e.g. p0=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in the order of the parameters of your initial function. You can use the ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù function on the scope to get initial guesses for your parameters e.g. amplitude, frequency and decay time. Differen tial Eq uatio n s an d their so lutio n s Since this is a model and not a physical system with a mass and a spring, we use the usual nomenclature of assigning m to the mass attached to the spring and k to the spring constant. The familiar general solutions below should help you set up the curve fit functions. It might be expected to also see an of fset from having the square pulse as a constant added to the dif ferential equation. Equations that define motion of a simple harmonic oscillator: With the familiar general solution: Differential equation for the damped or driven harmonic oscillator are : SUMMER 2 0 2 1 V1 With the gen eral so lutio n : The damped and driven harmonic oscillator dif fer only in the sign of Œ≥ - when this term is positive the system is damped and when negative it is driven. In this experiment, we will focus only on dampening the simple harmonic oscillator . Either way, this is an undercritically damped/driven harmonic oscillator because Œ≥<< k. The general solution stated above is the real part only , since the quadratic formula returns complex roots for the under critical case when obtaining the general solution.
