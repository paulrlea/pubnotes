Suppose the classical assumptions hold and you run the OLS regressions for y = β1 + β2x + ε and x = α1 + α2y + ξ using the same set of data. You obtain the OLS estimates ˆα1, ˆα2, ˆβ1, ˆβ2 with ˆσ2 x = 1 n ∑n i=1(xi − ˉx)2, and ˆσ2 y = 1 n ∑n i=1(yi − ˉy)2. Then which of the following is true?

Suppose the classical assumptions hold and you run the simple linear regression for the model: yi = α + βxi + ε using the sample data with sample size n = 100. You obtain estimates as ˆα = 2, ˆβ = 0.8, ˆσ2 = 4 and s.e( ˆβ) = 0.108.

If you reject a joint null hypothesis H0 : β2 = β3 = 0 using the F-test in a multiple hypothesis setting y = β1 + β2x2 + β3x3 + ε, then (a) the F-statistic must be negative. (b) R2 is close to one. (c) all of the hypotheses are always simultaneously rejected. (d) a series of individual t-tests may or may not give you the same conclusion. II Questions (60 points) 1. (20 points) There are 100 children in a small town. Someone wants to know what fraction of the children have obesity. They take a random sample of 50 children. 30 out of 50 children had obesity. (a) Suppose that, in fact, 70 children in the town have obesity. Find the probability that more than 40 children have obesity in a random sample of 50 children. (b) Obtain a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of children in the town with obesity. 2. (20 points) Sir Francis Galton, a cousin of James Darwin, examined the relationship between the height of children and their parents towards the end of the 19th century. It is from this study that the name ”regression” originated. His data contains 896 children. Let height denote the height of a child and M idheight the average height of his parents. (Following Galton’s methodology, both variables were adjusted so that the average female height was equal to the average male height.) The estimated relationship is given by ̂heighti = ˆβ1 + ˆβ2M idheighti with ˆβ1 = 22.26, ˆβ2 = 0.668, R2 = 0.104, ˆσ = √SSE/(n − 2) = 3.39 and s.e( ˆβ2) = 4.369. the mean of Midheight is M idheight = 66.75. (a) Interpret ˆβ1 and ˆβ2. (b) Interpret R2 and compute adjusted R2. (c) Compute the confidence interval for E(heighti) when M idheighti = 70. (d) Compute the prediction interval for heighti when M idheighti = 70. 3.
