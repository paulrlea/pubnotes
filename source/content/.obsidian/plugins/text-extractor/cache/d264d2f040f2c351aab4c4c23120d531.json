Many basic physical processes are periodic. Many periodic processes are harmonic or can be approximated as periodic.  Fourier series and transforms are important.  Fourier series and transforms allow us to determine how much of what frequency is required to fabricate a certain waveform. This is important for signal processing. (Do we have a detector or amplifier with a broad enough frequency response?) It also turns up in quantum theory. 3 Simple Harmonic Functions The simplest periodic processes are described by the sine or cosine function (examples: pendulum for small oscillations, tuning fork, string, sound waves, light waves, quantum wave functions) For a process that repeats itself f times per second: )Re(cos2cos tiAetAftAu   For a process that repeats itself in space 1/ times per meter along the x direction: )Re(cos 2 cos ikxAekxAxAu    And for a traveling wave (e.g. - sound, light):    )Re(cos tkxiAetkxAu   k=wavenumber=2/; =angular frequency=2f It is frequently easier to do mathematics using the complex notation and then take the real part of the result after the calculation is complete. 4 Anharmonic periodic waves: the Fourier series In general any periodic function can be represented as the sum of sine and cosine functions with wavelengths equal to the wavelength of the periodic function divided by an integer (/n) for a spatial wave. mkxBmkxA A xf m mm sincos 2 )( 1 0     All we need to do is find the coefficients.

You will find that the product of spatial and wavenumber widths is always equal to or greater than one. Since the deBroglie hypothesis relates wavelength to momentum, p=h/ we thus conclude that xp>=h/2. This is a statement of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We can do the same arithmetic for time and frequency, which can be translated into an uncertainty relation for energy and lifetime. 26 Useful trigonometric identities: 1cossin 2 cos1 2 cos 2 cos1 2 sin ))cos()(cos( 2 1 coscos ))cos()(cos( 2 1 sinsin 2 cos 2 cos2coscos ) 2 cos() 2 sin(2sinsin 22                                   AA AA AA BABABA BABABA BABA BA BABA BA 27 Standing waves kxII tkx tkxtkxEE 2 1 01 2101 sin4 cossin2E=E :identity sinB+sinA theusing and ))sin()(sin(     One way to get standing waves: reflection 28 Two waves of different frequencies: beats                                          kI tx k II tx k txkE txkk txkkEE txkEE txkEE cos12 22 cos4 22 coscos 2 1 cos )( 2 1 cos2 )cos( )cos( 1 2 1 01 2121 212101 22012 11011 29 Group velocity The beat envelope need not travel at the same speed as the individual waves! -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 1 101 201 5% k diff 30 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 1 101 201 5% k diff + 0.5 phase 31 The phase velocity of a single monochromatic wave is given by: kv p / The beat envelope moves with velocity: g eg p p pe p e vc dk dn n k n c vv ncv dk dv kvv kv kv /n refraction ofindex group 1 so /light for = since and / g              32 The Delta Function When we considered the cosine wavetrain of length a, we found: 0 0 0 1 2 ( ) cos cos cos( ) cos( ) sin( ) sin( ) ( ) ( ) a pa a ppa pp pp A k E k x kx dx E k k x k k x dx k k a k k a Ea k k a k k a             and we noted that the amplitude at a peak of this function grows linearly with a as the wavetrain length grows. At the same time, the width shrinks linearly with a, so that the area under the peak remains constant. The Dirac delta  function has the characteristic that is in infinitesimally narrow, but has area of one.
