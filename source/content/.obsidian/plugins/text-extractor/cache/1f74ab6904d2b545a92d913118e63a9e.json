Some mathematical facts about the Laplace equation: • It is a homogenous, 2nd order, linear partial differential equation. • In mathematical sciences, it is classified as an elliptic differential equation. • Analytically, the Laplace equation can solved by the methods of separation of variables in 11 coordinate systems. • So, any electrostatic problem where the geometry can be appropriately described by one of the 11 coordinate systems, the Laplace equation can be solved by separation of variables. • In PHYS4210 we limit ourselves to separation of variables in Cartesian coordinates x, y, z & spherical coordinates r, q, f .

Math tutorials Orthogonality of harmonic functions Simple Fourier Series Double Fourier Series 3. Determination of the Fourier coefficients of the general solution by boundary conditions Finding the general solution: v Example illustrated in Figure 2.9 V Math tutorial: Orthogonality of harmonic function Kronecker d : dnm=1 for n=m and dnm=0 for n≠m. The dimension of the integral is length, I missed writing down L. It does not matter in the end because the solution to the integral is “0” for n≠m. ] Math tutorial: Expanding a function in a Fourier series Kronecker d : dnm=1 for n=m and dnm=0 for n≠m. Math tutorial: Double Fourier Series Kronecker d : dnn’=1 for n=n’ and dnn’=0 for n≠n’. Same for dmm’. Follow up on last slide Anm=16 V0 / (p2 n m) Now we apply the previously discussed math to the general solution: x, y, z, with separation constants a, b, g • That’s it for today’s class. • Next class, I will provide a summary of the essentials for problem solving with an overview of common rectangular geometries and boundary conditions.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
