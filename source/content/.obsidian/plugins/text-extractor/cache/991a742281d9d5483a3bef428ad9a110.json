We already know from our prior math that the angular part of the Laplacian has the same eigenfunctions as the Hamiltonian. Let′s look more closely at the 𝐿 operator. We think: ෠𝐿 2𝜓 = 𝐿 2𝜓. Classically: 𝐿 = Ԧ𝑟 × Ԧ𝑝, so let′s do the math. 14 Angular momentum operators In Cartesian coordinates: 𝐿 = Ԧ𝑟 × Ԧ𝑝 = 𝑖 𝑗 𝑘 𝑥 𝑦 𝑧 𝑝𝑥 𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑧 𝐿𝑥 = 𝑦𝑝𝑧 − 𝑧𝑝𝑦 = ℏ 𝑖 𝑦 𝜕 𝜕𝑧 − 𝑧 𝜕 𝜕𝑦 𝐿𝑦 = 𝑧𝑝𝑥 − 𝑥𝑝𝑧 = ℏ 𝑖 𝑧 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 − 𝑥 𝜕 𝜕𝑧 𝐿𝑧 = 𝑥𝑝𝑦 − 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = ℏ 𝑖 𝑥 𝜕 𝜕𝑦 − 𝑦 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 15 Angular momentum in spherical coordinates (1) 𝐿𝑥 = ℏ 𝑖 −sin𝜑 𝜕 𝜕𝜃 − cot𝜃 cos𝜑 𝜕 𝜕𝜑 𝐿𝑦 = ℏ 𝑖 −cos𝜑 𝜕 𝜕𝜃 − cot𝜃 sin𝜑 𝜕 𝜕𝜑 𝐿𝑧 = ℏ 𝑖 𝜕 𝜕𝜑 16 Commutator: Reminder A simultaneous eigenstate is one whose state function is an eigenstate of two operators: ෠𝑄𝜓𝑞,𝑟 = 𝑞𝜓𝑞,𝑟 and ෠𝑅𝜓𝑞,𝑟 = 𝑟𝜓𝑞,𝑟 Because they are eigenstates: 𝑄 = 𝑞 Δ𝑄 = 0 and 𝑅 = 𝑟 Δ𝑅 = 0 ෠𝑄, ෠𝑅 = ෠𝑄 ෠𝑅 − ෠𝑅 ෠𝑄 = 0 1) Operators that commute define a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions. 2) Two operators that share a complete set of eigenfunctions commute. 17 Useful commutator/operator relations 𝐴, 𝐵 = 𝐴𝐵 − 𝐵𝐴 𝐴, 𝐵 = − 𝐵, 𝐴 𝐴, 𝐵 + 𝐶 = 𝐴, 𝐵 + 𝐴, 𝐶 𝐴, 𝐵𝐶 = 𝐴, 𝐵 𝐶 + 𝐵 𝐴, 𝐶 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶 + 𝐵, 𝐶, 𝐴 + 𝐶, 𝐴, 𝐵 = 0 18 What can we tell about L? We can learn quite a bit about angular momentum without doing any integrals. We can show that 𝐿𝑧, and 𝐿𝑥 cannot have a complete set of common eigenstates by considering the commutator 𝐿𝑧, 𝐿𝑥 . 𝐿𝑧 = 𝑥𝑝𝑦 − 𝑦𝑝𝑥; 𝐿𝑥 = 𝑦𝑝𝑧 − 𝑧𝑝𝑦; 𝐿𝑦 = 𝑧𝑝𝑥 − 𝑥𝑝𝑧 𝐿 2 = 𝐿𝑥 2 + 𝐿𝑦 2 + 𝐿𝑧 2 𝐿𝑥, 𝐿𝑧 = 𝑦𝑝𝑧 − 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑥𝑝𝑦 − 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = 𝑦𝑝𝑧, 𝑥𝑝𝑦 − 𝑦𝑝𝑧, 𝑦𝑝𝑥 − 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑥𝑝𝑦 + 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = 𝑦𝑝𝑧, 𝑥𝑝𝑦 + 0 + 0 + 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = 𝑥 𝑦𝑝𝑧, 𝑝𝑦 + 𝑦𝑝𝑧, 𝑥 𝑝𝑦 + 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = −𝑥 𝑝𝑦, 𝑦𝑝𝑧 − 𝑥, 𝑦𝑝𝑧 𝑝𝑦 + 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = −𝑥𝑦 𝑝𝑦, 𝑝𝑧 − 𝑥 𝑝𝑦, 𝑦 𝑝𝑧 − 𝑦 𝑥, 𝑝𝑧 𝑝𝑦 − 𝑥, 𝑦 𝑝𝑧𝑝𝑦 + 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = = 0 − 𝑥 𝑝𝑦, 𝑦 𝑝𝑧 + 0 − 0 + 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = 𝑥 𝑦, 𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑧 + 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑦𝑝𝑥 = 𝑥 𝑦, 𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑧 + 𝑦 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑝𝑥 + 𝑧𝑝𝑦, 𝑦 𝑝𝑥 = 𝑥 𝑦, 𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑧 − 𝑦 𝑝𝑥, 𝑧𝑝𝑦 − 𝑦, 𝑧𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑥 = 𝑥 𝑦, 𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑧 − 𝑦𝑧 𝑝𝑥, 𝑝𝑦 − 𝑦 𝑝𝑥, 𝑧 𝑝𝑦 − 𝑧 𝑦, 𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑥 − 𝑦, 𝑧 𝑝𝑦𝑝𝑥 = 𝑥 𝑦, 𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑧 − 0 − 0 − 𝑧 𝑦, 𝑝𝑦 𝑝𝑥 − 0 = 𝑖ℏ 𝑥𝑝𝑧 − 𝑧𝑝𝑥 = −𝑖ℏ𝐿𝑦 Similarly: 𝐿𝑥, 𝐿𝑦 = 𝑖ℏ𝐿𝑧 and 𝐿𝑦, 𝐿𝑧 = 𝑖ℏ𝐿𝑥 19 What can we tell about L? • We can also show (homework!) that [L2,Lz]=0. • This tells us that there exists a complete set of eigenfunctions for both operators, or that we can measure both quantities simultaneously with infinite accruracy. • (We already knew that because we did the work to find the eigenfunctions and values, but we could have avoided that work if all we wanted was to know whether it could be done.) 20 Angular Momentum in Spherical coordinates (2) ෠𝐿 2 = −ℏ 2 𝜕2 𝜕𝜃2 + cot 𝜃 𝜕 𝜕𝜃 + 1 sin2 𝜃 𝜕2 𝜕𝜑2 • We have already found the eigenfunctions of this operator. They are the spherical harmonics. • We have previously found that the eigenvalues of L2 are l(l+1) with l=integers 0, 1, 2, 3... if the potential is central. • Angular momentum manifests itself as a magnetic dipole moment when the particle with L has charge. • It is most useful to know the projection of the dipole onto an applied magnetic field.
