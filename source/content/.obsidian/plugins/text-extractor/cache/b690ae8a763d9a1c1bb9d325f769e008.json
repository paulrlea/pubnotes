Semenoff The Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, and Department ofPhysics, '~ University ofBritish Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T2A6, Canada {Received 4 September 1984) A condensed-matter analog of (2+1)-dimensional electrodynamics is constructed, and the consequences of a recently discovered anomaly in such systems are discussed. PACS numbers: 05.50.+q Recently, new anomalous phenomena in (2 +1)-dimensional systems of fermions and gauge fields have received much attention. ' The associ- ated fermion zero modes, induced currents of ab- norrnal parity, unusual quantum numbers, and frac- tional statistics are interesting manifestations of the role of topological structures in quantum physics. Some of these, fractional charge and statistics in particular, are relevant to the understanding of the quantized Hall effect, which appears in planar sys- tems of nonrelativistic electrons. However, rela- tivistic (2+ 1)-dimensional gauge theories still lack a realistic physical setting. The purpose of this Letter is to point out one such realization and to discuss the consequences of anomalies there. In the lattice formulation of gauge theories on even-dimensional space-times the axial anomaly can be understood as an external field-induced level shift. ' Recently, on this basis, the formal similari- ty of fermions in lattice gauge theories and the tight-binding description of electrons in crystals has been used to propose a condensed-matter analog of the (3+1)-dimensional axial anomaly. \" In a hy- pothetical, parity-noninvariant, gapless semicon- ductor the electron energy bands exhibit degeneracy points, i.e., points on the Fermi surface where the conduction and valence bands intersect. The low- energy electron dynamics are described by lineariz- ing their spectrum about the degeneracy points and are thus modeled by relativistic Weyl fermions. It is a general theorem that these must occur in right- and left-handed pairs. ' In the presence of parallel external electric and magnetic fields the axial ano- maly effects a transfer of electrons between the right- and left-handed degeneracy points, observ- able as a strong longitudinal magnetoconductance. In the following we shall develop a similar condensed-matter analog of (2+ 1)-dimensional electrodynamics. We consider the tight-binding description of electrons on a planar, honeycomb lat- tice. The band structure exhibits two degeneracy points per Brillouin zone and the low-energy behavior is obtained in the continuum limit where two species of relativistic (2+1)-dimensional fer- mions emerge. Then, in accordance with general considerations, external magnetic fields induce zero modes in the electron energy spectrum, and the resulting degenerate ground states are charged. We shall suggest scenarios where these induced charges may be observed. The model considered here has been used exten- sively to study the electromagnetic properties of graphite. ' Graphite is a semimetal which to a first approximation is composed of independent layers of carbon atoms. Each layer forms a honeycomb lattice with one valence electron per atomic site. In the planar material, the existence of two degeneracy points per Brillouin zone is a general consequence of the lattice symmetries. ' Here, we shall present a simple dynamical model where this degeneracy is 1984 The American Physical Society 2449 VOr. UME 53, NUMBER 26 PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 24 DECEMBER 1984 explicit. In three-dimensional graphite, interplanar interactions break the symmetry, '5 and this model may not be strictly applicable there. However, there may be various types of intercalated or exfoli- ated graphite where the interplanar coupling is negligible. Furthermore, it may be possible to fab- ricate a graphite monolayer where the effects which we describe would be observable. Before we present the details of our model let us review the salient features of three-dimensional electrodynamics. On odd-dimensional space-times chirality is absent (there is no analog of ys) and conservation laws for fermionic currents are not anomalous. However, a new phenomenon of this type is known to arise. For each species of fer- mions, external gauge fields induce a current of ab- normal parity in the ground state. For example, consider a fermion coupled to a U(1) gauge field in (2+ 1)-dimensions with Lagrangian L (x) = P(x) (iy~D„m)y (—x) where y\" = (a3,i a', i o.2) (o' a.re the Pauli matrices) and D„=8„—ieA~ The. induced current is j\"(x) = (e/gm) e~\"\"F„z(x)sgn(m) +. . . . (2) Corrections to (2) are of higher orders in deriva- tives of F„„=6„A„—B„A„and (2) gives the induced electric charge 0=fd xj (x) =e4/ 2sgn(m) exactly, 2 where 4=2rr 'Jd x B(x) the magnetic flux. The mass term in (1) violates parity which is defined as the reflection of one spa- tial coordinate: Ap 2(xl, x2, t) Ap 2( —Xl,X2, t); A t (xt,xg, t) —3 i ( —x, ,x2, t); y (xt, x2, t) —rr'y ( —x, ,x, , t) When m 0, (1) is formally invariant under this transformation. However, the current (2) retains its parity-noninvariant contribution with an ambigu- ous sign. This sign anomaly of the massless limit has its origin in the existence of zero-energy bound states of the relevant Dirac Hamiltonian, 5 H= —iy y D. In a static background magnetic field (Ap = 0, A, = 0) with quantized flux, ~4 ~ = n, the spatial manifold can be compactified to S (rather than R2), '6'7 the spectrum of 0 is discrete, and index theorems'6' (or an explicit construction5) indicate n zero modes. The ground state of the quantum systems is (n+I)-fold degenerate with induced vacuum charges g= —(e/2) ~4~, —(e/2) ~C&~ + e, ..., (./2) I~I. \" Consider the planar honeycomb lattice depicted in Fig. 1. The Bravais lattice is triangular and the unit cell contains two sites, which we denote type A and type B. The type A sites are generated by linear combinations of the basis vectors at = ( —, ' J3, ——,')a; a2= (0, 1)a (where a is the lattice spac- ing), with integer coefficients, A(ntn2) = ntat + n2a2. The sublattices are connected by the vec- tors b, = (I/243, —,' )a; b2 ——(I/243, ——', )a; b3 = ( —I/J3, 0) a, and the type B sites are generated by B(mtmz) = mt at+ m2a2+ bt. The reciprocal- lattice basis vectors are Rt = (4'/ j3a ) (1,0); R2= (4'/%3a) ( —,', —,'W3) and the Brillouin zone, Qz, is a hexagon in momentum space with opposite sides identified (see Fig. 2). The graphite lattice is monatomic with the sites occupied by carbon atoms. We consider a slightly more general diatomic system by assuming that sites A and 8 are occupied by distinct types of atoms. We parametrize the difference of energies of electrons localized on A and B by P.

In the tight-binding approximation and where only nearest-neighbor interactions are retained, the Hamil- tonian is H=nx[U (A) V(A+ b, )+ Vf(A+ b, ) U(A)]+PX[U (A) U(A) —V (A+ bt) V(A+ bt)]. A, i A (3) Here U and U ( V and V) are the creation and destruction operators for electrons localized on sites A (B), respectively.

With one electron per site (one electron per unit cell per spin degree of freedom), the negative-energy states (valence band) are filled and the positive-energy states (conduction band) are empty. The separation of the conduction and valence bands is minimal at the zeros of exp(ik bt)+exp(ik b2)+exp(ik b3). These occur at qt=(4m/J3a) x ( —, , I/243), q2= — q&, and all other equivalent points, which are the corners of the Brillouin zone (jiklmn in Fig. 2). In the continuum (low energy) limit (a 0), only electron states near qt and q2 participate in the dynamics. We obtain two species of fermions: U(k —qt) U(k+ qt) Qt(k) = 2na J3exp( —i ,'7ro)—(-. , , ifi2(k) = ,'na J—3exp(—i ', mo3)o-'— Vk —q&j' V&k+q&j ' (4) with Hamiltonian H= dk 2m' i k y k+m i k + 2 k y k —m 2 k where m =2P/J3na In coord. inate space, H= dx 2m ix iy D+m ix+ 2x iy D —m 2x (5) and = (e/4n )ei'\"\"F„„(x)sgn(m) + jf\" (x) = & & [02 Y P2]) = —(e/4m) e&\"\"F„„(x)sgn(m) + where we have assumed that the interaction with the electromagnetic field proceeds through minimal coupling.

Furthermore, it has the conjugation symmetry pi (7 lf/2 I(2 0 3IP 3, H —H. The separately conserved induced currents are where we have included a factor of 2 for the spin degeneracy. Therefore, because of the fermion doubling, the electric current j~+ = jf\" +jf\" van- ishes. The odd combination is nonzero: = (e/2m) ei'\"\"F„k(x)sgn(m) + However, it would couple to an unphysical external field of abnormal parity and is therefore not directly observable. In the massless limit i8 0 or m ~ 0 we recover the graphite model. There the general considera- tions imply that in an external magnetic field with flux i'Ii'i = n, there are 2n zero-energy modes. If we take the electron spin into account, each of these bound states is a spin doublet. The ground state is 2451 VOLUME 53, NUMBER 26 PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 24 DECEMBER 1984 then (4n+1)-fold degenerate, the charges of these states being Q= —2el@l, —2el@l+e, . . . , 2e lel. The spinless state (all spina paired) with charge Q = + ( —)2e ICl is easily obtained by the intro- duction of a small positive (negative) chemical po- tential which guarantees that all zero-energy levels are occupied (unoccupied). Alternatively, if the electrons are subject to the Zeeman interaction which has the effect of raising the energy of those whose spins are aligned parallel with a uniform external magnetic field and of lowering the energy of those antialigned, the system would be un- charged but would have 2n unpaired spins. The latter scenario would be observable as an an- isotropic electron spin-resonance amplitude. The Zeeman splitting of the energy levels is approxi- mately independent of the direction of the external field. However, the flux through the plane of the system (and therefore the number of zero modes) is proportional to the sine of the angle 8 between the plane and the external field. The number of unpaired spins per unit area is therefore equal to 4mB sin0. The angle dependence of the electron spin-resonance amplitude would be direct evidence for the vacuum degeneracy. Observation of this ef- fect in a real material such as planar graphite would be an interesting confirmation of the phenomena which we have described.
