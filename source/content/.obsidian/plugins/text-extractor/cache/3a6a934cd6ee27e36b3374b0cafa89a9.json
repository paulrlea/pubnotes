Take a look for perspective. Patents, and Research & Development • The U.S. has relied on private sector initiative and market mechanisms for the direction of research & development • In the pharmaceutical industry, government, private philanthropy and academia intimately involved in new product development • Government sponsors relatively little applied research, towards commercialization of a product • Government & private philanthropy directly fund basic research, to advance knowledge Patents, and Research & Development • Patents are necessary to protect innovators • Given high $R&D and lengthy pharma product development, no or weak patents will result in somewhat limited incentives to innovate • Over 65% of the world’s total R&D spending in pharma is based in U.S. • Introduction of new drugs is a major determinant in profitability • The longer a drug is on the market, its profitability and sales fall Patents, and Research & Development Source: milkeninstitute.org Patents, and Research & Development Number of new chemical or biological entities developed between 1998 and 2022, by region of origin Patents, and Research & Development Distribution of biotechnology patents filed in 2018 by select country Source: Statista Patents, and Research & Development Select leading global biotechnology company R&D expenditures in 2019 ($million) Source: Statista Patents, and Research & Development Orphan Drugs • Pharma protects its products through patents, which provide exclusive rights to production of the drug, usually for 20 years • But the long development period for many drugs, often 12-15 years, means the effective market benefit of the drug is much less • Exception: when firms pursue orphan drugs, those used to treat rare diseases but which have limited commercial value; firm receives the exclusive right to manufacture Pharmaceuticals – R&D ProcessImpact of Patents on Prices • Patent provides innovator with monopoly power: to limit availability and set prices above marginal cost of production • See BM1 slides and problems for monopoly solutions • Patents can distort pharma prices, limit treatment options for individuals who do not have the means to pay (uninsured or under-insured), and increase medical costs • Prices are lower for brand-name drugs in Europe and Canada • Reason for lower prices? We did this earlier: Monopsony model of decision-making and pharma pricing in variants of single-payer healthcare systems (prevalent in Europe and Canada) • But vast majority of these countries produce very few, if any, new cutting-edge pharma products Pharmaceutical Pricing • Structure of demand and costs • Bit later we will discuss in more detail pharmaceuticals pricing, nature of competition, etc. All of those discussions and readings are relevant here • We discussed models of Bertrand differentiated-products price competition. Materials in BM2 will be relevant here • Between-patent competition: when multiple patented pharma compete in the same treatment category (e.g., lung cancer) • Within-patent competition: when generics/biosimilars enter and there is competition in the same molecular structure Pricing a Patented Drug: Monopoly Earlier we discussed pharma cost structure and pricing Pricing a Patented Drug: Monopoly and Insurance Earlier we discussed effects of insurance on demand and prices Pricing a Patented Drug: Complex Issues • Cost of producing a modern drug is high, because of high expenditures on R&D and clinical trials • Are new drugs worth the high cost? • If drug therapy reduces need for expensive treatments such as surgery • If drug therapy can prevent or slow the progression of certain diseases, increase longevity, and quality of life (we will discuss Quality-adjusted-life-years, QALY, later in the semester) • The insurance system (private, mix of private and Government, or some version of single-payer) presents a complex tradeoff • Vast majority of countries do not innovate to produce new frontline drugs. They are just consumers of these products Pharmaceuticals: Advertising & Promotion • Pharma firms can spend twice, or more, on administration & marketing compared to what they spend on R&D • Are these necessary expenditures? • Later we will examine specific advt and marketing complexities • New drugs may sell at 3-6 times (or much higher multiple) than their MC of production • But what about R&D and bringing these products to market? • How long can a firm enjoy monopoly status? • Most sales efforts directed at providers, but increasingly, direct to consumer (DTC) ads • Complex role of advertising in this industry Role of FDA • The FDA has been criticized as too cautious in the regulatory processing, causing delays in approval of new drugs, worried about: • Type I error: mistakenly allowing a harmful drug onto the market before fully tested (ex: thalidomide, kept out of U.S. market, but allowed in Europe, causing birth deformities) • Type II error: delaying a drug from market until its safety and efficacy are fully understood (reduces competition, raises costs) • Type I highly visible; Type II not • In our specialized modules we will examine the complexities FDA confronts when undertaking drug approvals • We will also take a brief look at COVID vaccine development and FDA approvals Some Issues for the Industry • Pharma firms widely criticized for high markups, high profits margins, & high and rising prices on most popular products • Price controls on prescription drugs in Canada, for example, have resulted in substantially lower prices • About 25% at wholesale level • However, since Canadian price controls were adopted, hardly any new frontline pharma products developed there • Vast majority of countries have no new product development • Supporting pharma R&D perhaps requires incentives that reach globally • Pharma R&D spending creates a cost-allocation problem.
