Macroscopic electric fields are the electric fields E we measure, e.g. Coulomb-force acting on a test charge E = F / q, or E calculated from measured electric potentials V by voltmeters. 2. The measured macroscopic electric fields in matter are explained theoretically by assuming that the material is filled with (induced or permanent) electric dipoles (or sometimes higher order poles). 3. Macroscopic electric fields in matter are averages over microscopic electric fields present within an atom and molecules. Averaging is performed over volumes large compared to the volume of an individual atom or molecule. Figuring out (2) and (3) [particularly making sure that averaging procedure is sound] was subject of scientific research and debate (!) for hundreds of years. Today, the questions are soundly answered and we apply the results.
