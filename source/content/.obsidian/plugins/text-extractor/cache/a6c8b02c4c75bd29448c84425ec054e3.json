{"path":"Notes/@SchoolFall 2023/School/Economics/Notes/Exam 2_Study Guide.pdf","text":"Exam 2 _ Study Guide ECON 4190: International Economics & Globalization The second exam includes 26 True/False and multiple-choice questions where 2 or 3 of these are from in- class presentations (each worth 1.5 points for a total of %39 of the grade). There are also 4 explanatory questions for which you need to show graphing and calculations (%61 of the grade). You will have 80 minutes time limit to answer all the questions. Don’t forget to bring a calculator. Chapters 6 to 10 and 14 are included in the exam. Study the book, PPT slides, your notes, online homeworks, and group assignments, as well as the sample questions included in this study guide. Make sure to study all the material and understand the concepts. Sample Questions 1. Assume a firm has monopoly both at Home and in Foreign. a. Home's demand curve for the product is P = $100 - 0.5Q (Q is measured in millions of goods), while Foreign's demand is P* = $50 - 0.1Q*. Assume the marginal cost at home is a constant MC = $10, but there is a $4 shipping cost to Foreign so MC* = $14. Solve for the profit-maximizing prices P and P*, as well as the profit-maximizing quantities Q and Q*. If you don't know calculus, just remember that marginal revenue is twice as steep as demand. b. Assume the firm's fixed cost is a total of $4000 (millions) and solve for total profit from Home and Foreign sales. 2. Consider a small country with a domestic oil monopoly and rising marginal costs. a. Assuming demand is linear, show the monopoly’s demand, marginal cost, and marginal revenue curves. Show how the monopoly’s profit-maximizing price and quantity (Pm, Qm) compare to those under perfect competition (Pc, Qc). b. On a new diagram, suppose that the country can now import oil at a world price below Pc. Show its imports. Relative to the monopoly equilibrium, how would free trade affect consumer and producer surplus in the oil market? 3. Suppose that Home's domestic market for shoes is perfectly competitive. Demand and supply are linear, so every time price changes by $1, quantity-demanded changes by 30 million and quantity-supplied changes by 20 million. At the current free-trade price of $60, Home produces 500 million pairs per year, and imports 3 billion pairs. a. Find the supply and demand equations and solve for Home’s equilibrium price and quantity. b. Solve P when S=0 and when D=0 in order to find the vertical intercepts, and draw the supply and demand diagram. Solve for both consumer surplus and producer surplus at the equilibrium price and quantity. c. Now consider the free-trade price of $60 and solve for consumer surplus and producer surplus. Do you see a decrease or increase in each of them? Assume that Home is a very small part of the world shoe market, and Home's government imposed a $10 tariff on imported shoes. d. Solve for the new domestic P, quantity-supplied, quantity-demanded, and quantity of shoes imported. e. Solve for welfare effects of the tariff comparing to the free trade situation by showing the changes in Home's consumer surplus, producer surplus, and the government revenue on a graph. What is the total change in Home’s welfare? Assume in the above case that Home is instead a large part of the world's shoe market, and suppose that Home now imposes a $15 tariff, which makes the domestic price rise by $10 but decreases the world price by $5. f. Calculate the changes in Home's total welfare from this tariff comparing to the free trade situation. 4. Assume that the euro interest rate is constant at 5 percent, and that the expected exchange rate is 1.05 dollars per one euro. Find the expected dollar return on euro deposits for the following cases. Multiple-Choice Sample Questions 1) Tastes of individuals are represented by A) isovalue lines.
