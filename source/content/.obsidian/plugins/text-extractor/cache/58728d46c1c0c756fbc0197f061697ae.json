There is an optimal load resistance that will draw the most power from the solar cell at a given illumination level. • non-radiative recombination • limited mobilityPHAS0058, Lecture 3 Dr Monika Szumilo Spectral lossesPHAS0058, Lecture 3 Dr Monika Szumilo geminate vs. non-geminate recombination Three possible losses mechanism within recombination: 1) relaxationof excitons which fail to diffuse to, and separate at, a suitable molecular interface, 2) geminate recombination: recombination of geminate pairs formed at that interface which fail to fully dissociate 3) non-geminate recombination: recombination of dissociated carriers generated by different absorption events D. Credgington et al., Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 2135–2141PHAS0058, Lecture 3 Dr Monika Szumilo Charge transfer: heterojunction  two materials of different electron affinities create an energetic offset = driving energy for exciton dissociation  rate of photoinduced e transfer decreases exponentially with separation of D/A -> electrons have to migrate to the interface to dissociate planar heterojunction  easy to make  long distance compared to average exciton diffusion length (5-20nm due to short lifetime)  thinner layers – worse absorption bulk heterojunction  more common  shorter distance to interface  material not always matched with electrodePHAS0058, Lecture 3 Dr Monika Szumilo Charge transfer: heterojunction type I heterojuction  only energy transfer 1-> 2 possible  ΔE must be comparable to kT type II heterojunction  more complex photophysics  energy or charge transfer possible  size of ΔE comparable to binding energy of excitonPHAS0058, Lecture 3 Dr Monika Szumilo Type II heterojunction Dr Monika Szumilo Double layer structure Sariciftci et al APL (1993), Halls et al (1996) - most of implementations use good electron acceptor + polymer - electron acceptor traditionally C60 - example below: 1% efficiency (FF=0.48) issues: - filter effect - only 1 interface - large distance for charge transport (favours recombination) Dr Monika Szumilo Interpenetrating polymer networks JJ Halls et al.
