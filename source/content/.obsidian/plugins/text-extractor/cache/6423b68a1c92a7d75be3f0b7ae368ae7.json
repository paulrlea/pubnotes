Low birth weight infants tend to have increased risks of serious health problems. It has been suggested that factors related to birth weight in- clude baby sex, gestational age at which the child is born, race, mother height and mother weight. To investigate this relationship, 500 infants born in a large metropolitan hospital in the U.S. were studied and the following model was estimated: Bwi = β1 + β2Sexi + β3GAi + β4Blacki + β5M Hi + β6M Wi + ϵi where Bw = Infant birth weight Sex = 1 if male, 0 otherwise Black = 1 if mother is black, 0 otherwise GA = Gestational age (calculated as number of weeks/40) M H = Mother height (calculated as actual height (in feet)/5.8) M W = Mother weight (calculated as actual weight (in pound) /130) For a range of models the coefficient estimates and residual sum of squares (SSR) are reported below. For the first model (model A), estimated stan- dard errors are also reported in parentheses below the coefficient estimates.

(use Model A): Sex = 1, GA = 0.95; Black = 0; M H = 0.9;M W = 1.2. (b) Compute R2 for Model A? Compute (adjusted) ˉR2 for Model A? Explain the meaning of R2 for Model A. (c) Test the joint hypothesis that the coefficients on all of the variables (other than the constant) in Model A are equal zero at 5% significance level (F0.05(5, 494) = 2.21). (d) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient on Black in Model A. What does it tell you? (t0.025(494) = 1.96) (e) How would you explain the change in the estimated impact of MW when Model E is used rather than Model A. Do you expect the coeffi- cient of MW in model E will be significant at 5% level? why? Which of the two models is better? Why? 2","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
