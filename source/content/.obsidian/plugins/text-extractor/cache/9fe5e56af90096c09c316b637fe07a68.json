Introduction This paper has three parts0 The first part is a simplified presentation of the basic ideas of the renormalization group and the ε expansion applied to critical pheno/ mena. following roughly a summary exposition given in A‘öYA0 The second part is an account of the history +as I remember it, of work leading up to the papers in I‘öA/A‘öY on the renormalization group0 Finally. some of the developments since A‘ö A will be summarized. and an assessment for the future given0 II0 Many Length Scales and the Renormalization Group There are a number of problems in science which have. as a common charac/ teristic. that complex microscopic behavior underlies macroscopic effects0 In simple cases the microscopic fluctuations average out when larger scales are considered. and the averaged quantities satisfy classical continuum equ/ ations0 Hydrodynamics is a standard example of this where atomic fluctuations average out and the classical hydrodynamic equations emerge0 Unfortunately. there is a much more difficult class of problems where fluctuations persist out to macroscopic wavelengths. and fluctuations on all intermediate length scales are important too0 In this last category are the problems of fully developed turbulent fluid flow. critical phenomena. and elementary particle physics0 The problem of magnetic impurities in non/magnetic metals +the Kondo problem, turns out also to be in this category0 In fully developed turbulence in the atmosphere. global air circulation becomes unstable. leading to eddies on a scale of thousands of miles0 These eddies break down into smaller eddies. which in turn break down. until chaotic motions on all length scales down to millimeters have been excited0 On the scale of millimeters. viscosity damps the turbulent fluctuations and no smaller scales are important until atomic scales are reached0Y In quantum field theory. “elementary” particles like electrons. photons. protons and neutrons turn out to have composite internal structure on all size scales down to 20 At least this is the prediction ofquantum field theory0 It is hard to make observations of this small distance structure directly“ instead the particle scattering cross sections that experimentalists measure must be interpreted K. G. Wilson 103 using quantum field theory0 Without the internal structure that appears in the theory. the predictions of quantum field theory would disagree with the experi/ mental findings0] A critical point is a special example of‘ a phase transition0 Consider. for example. the water/steam transition0 Suppose the water and steam are placed under pressure. always at the boiling temperature0 At the critical point’ a pressure of’YAü Atm and temperature the distinction between water and steam disappears. and the whole boiling phenomenon vanishes0 The prin/ cipal distinction between water and steam is that they have different densities0 As the pressure and temperature approach their critical values. the difference in density between water and steam goes to zero0 At the critical point one finds bubbles of steam and drops of water intermixed at all size scales from macro/ scopic. visible sizes down to atomic scales0 Away from the critical point. surface tension makes small drops or bubbles unstable“ but as water and steam become indistinguishable at the critical point. the surface tension between the two phases vanishes0 In particular. drops and bubbles near micron sizes cause strong light scattering. called “critical opalescence”. and the water and steam become milky0 In the Kondo effect. electrons of all wavelengths from atomic wavelengths up to very much larger scales. all in the conduction band of a metal. interact with the magnetic moment of each impurity in the metal0} Theorists have difficulties with these problems because they involve very many coupled degrees of freedom0 It takes many variables to characterize a turbulent flow or the state of a fluid near the critical point0 Analytic methods are most effective when functions of only one variable one degree of freedom, are involved0 Some extremely clever transformations have enabled special cases of the problems mentioned above to be rewritten in terms of independent degrees of freedom which could be solved analytically0 These special examples include Onsager’s solution of the two dimensional Ising model of a critical point. éthe solution of Andrei and Wiegmann of the Kondo problem.ö the solution of’ the Thirring model of a quantum field theory.ü and the simple solutions of noninter/ acting quantum fields0 ‘These are however only special cases“ the entire problem of’ fully developed turbulence. many problems in critical phenomena and virtually all examples of strongly coupled quantum fields have defeated analytic techniques up till now. Computers can extend the capabilities of‘ theorists. but even numerical computer methods are limited in the number of degrees of freedom that are practical0 Normal methods of’ numerical integration fail beyond only } to A2 integration variables“ partial differential equations likewise become extremely difficult beyond ] or so independent variables0 Monte Carlo and statistical averaging methods can treat some cases of’ thousands or even millions of vari/ ables but the slow convergence of these methods versus computing time used is a perpetual hassle0 An atmospheric flow simulation covering all length scales of turbulence would require a grid with millimeter spacing covering thousands of miles horizontally and tens of miles vertically’ the total number of grid points would be of order l2 Y} far beyond the capabilities of any present or conceivable computer0 104 Physics 1982 The “renormalization group” approach is a strategy for dealing with problems involving many length scales0 The strategy is to tackle the problem in steps. one step for each length scale0 In the case ofcritical phenomena. the problem. tech/ nically. is to carry out statistical averages over thermal fluctuations on all size scales0 The renormalization group approach is to integrate out the fluctuations in sequence starting with fluctuations on an atomic scale and then moving to successively larger scales until fluctuations on all scales have been averaged out. To illustrate the renormalization group ideas the case of’ critical phenomena will be discussed in more detail0 First the mean field theory of Landau will be described. and important questions defined0 The renormalization group will be presented as an improvment to Landau’s theory0 The Curie point of a ferromagnet will be used as a specific example of a critical point0 Below the Curie temperature. an ideal ferromagnet exhibits spontaneous magnetization in the absence of’ an external magnetic field“ the direction of’ the magnetization depends on the history of the magnet0 Above the Curie tempera/ ture Tc. there is no spontaneous magnetization0 Figure A shows a typical plot of’ the spontaneous magnetization versus temperature0 Just below the Curie temperature the magnetization is observed to behave as +Tc /T,β. where β is an exponent somewhere near l1] +in three dimensions,0 ‘0A2 Magnetism IS caused at the atomic level by unpaired electrons with magnetic moments. and in a ferromagnet. a pair of nearby electrons with moments aligned has a lower energy than if the moments are anti/aligned0A2 At high temperatures. thermal fluctuations prevent magnetic order0 As the temperature is reduced towards the Curie temperature. alignment of one moment causes preferential alignment out to a considerable distance called the correlation length At the Curie temperature. the correlation length becomes infinite. marking the onset of preferential alignment of the entire system0 Just above Tc . the correlation length is found to behave as +T/T c,-v. where v is about Y1] +in three dimensions,0AA A simple statistical mechanical model of a ferromagnet involves a Hamiltonian which is a sum over nearest neighbor moment pairs with different energies for the aligned and antialigned case0 In the simplest case. the moments are allowed only to be positive or negative along a fixed spatial axis“ the resulting model is called the Ising model0AY The formal prescription for determining the properties of’ this model is to compute the partition function Z. which is the sum of the Boltzmann factor exp+/H1kT, over all configurations of the magnetic moments. where k is Boltz/ mann’s constant0 The free energy F is proportional to the negative logarithm of Z0 The Boltzmann factor exp+/H1kT, is an analytic function of T near Tc. in fact for all T except T = 20 A sum of analytic functions is also analytic0 Thus it is puzzling that magnets +including the Ising model, show complex non/analytic behavior at T = Tc0 The true non/analytic behavior occurs only in the thermo/ dynamic limit of a ferromagnet ofinfinite size“ in this limit there are an infinite number of configurations and there are no analyticity theorems for the infinite sums appearing in this limit0 However. it is difficult to understand how even an infinite sum can give highly non/analytic behavior0 A major challenge has been to show how the non/analyticity develops0 K. G. Wilson 105 Landau’s proposalA] was that if only configurations with a given magne/ tization density M are considered then the free energy is analytic in M0 For small M. the form of the free energy +to fourth order in M, is +from the analyticity assumption, F = V { R MY- U M a} +A, where V is the volume of the magnet and R and U are temperature/dependent constants0 +A constant term independent of M has been omitted,0 In the absence of an external magnetic field. the free energy cannot depend on the sign of M. hence only even powers of M occur0 The true free energy is the minimum of F over all possible values of M0 In Landau’s theory. R is 2 at the critical temperature. and U must be positive so that the minimum of F occurs at M = 2 when at the critical temperature0 The minimum of F continues to be at M = 2 if R is positive’ this corresponds to temperatures above critical0 If R is negative the minimum occurs for non/zero M. namely the M value satisfying 2 = = + Y R M - a U M], or (2) +], This corresponds to temperatures below critical0 Along with the analyticity of the free energy in M. Landau assumed analyticity in T. namely that R and U are analytic functions of T0 Near this means that 106 Physics 1982 to a first approximation. U is a constant and R +which vanishes at T., is pro/ portional to T/Tc +It is assumed that dR1dT does not vanish at Then. below Tc . the magnetization behaves as M +Tc /T , A1Y +a, i0e0 the exponent β is A1Y which disagrees with the evidence. experimental and theoretical. that β is about l1]0‘ Landau’s theory allows for a slowly varying space/dependent magnetization0 The free energy for this case takes the Landau/Ginzburg formAa F = +}, where B+x, is the external magnetic field0 The gradient term is the leading term in an expansion involving arbitrarily many gradients as well as arbitrarily high powers of M0 For slowly varying fields M+x, high er powers of gradients are small and are neglected0 +Normally the term has a constant coefficient / in this paper this coefficient is arbitrarily set to A, 0 One use of this generalized free energy is to compute the correlation length above For this purpose let B+x, be very small δ function localized at x = 20 The U term in F can be neglected. and the magnetization which minimize the free energy satisfies = +é, The solution M+x, is +ö, and the correlation length can be read off to be Hence near 0 is predicted to behave as which again disagrees with experimental and theoretical evidence0 The Landau theory assumes implicitly that analyticity is maintained as all space/ dependent fluctuations are averaged out0 The loss of analyticity arises only when averaging over the values of the overall average magnetization M0 It is this overall averaging. over . which leads to the rule that F must be minimized over M. and the subsequent non/analytic formula +a, for M0 To be precise. if the volume of the magnet is finite. must be integrated over M. with analytic results0 It is only in the thermodynamic limit V that the average of is constructed by minimizing F with respect to M0 and the nonanalyticity of Eqn0 +a, occurs0 The Landau theory has the same physical motivation as hydrodynamics0 Landau assumes that only fluctuations on an atomic scale matter0 Once these have been averaged out the magnetization M+x, becomes a continuum. con/ tinous function which fluctuates only in response to external space/dependent stimuli0 M+x, +or. if it is a constant.

Wilson 109 since only one term from the sum over n contributes within the spatial volume occupied by the wavefunction The other simplification that will be made is to treat MH+x, as if it were a constant over the volume occupied by +x,0 In other words the very long wave/ lengths in MH+x, are emphasized relative to wavelengths close to L0 The calculation to be performed is to compute I +Aa, where and FL. involve integration only over the volume occupied by In expanding out the following simplifications will be made0 First. all terms linear in are presumed to integrate to 2 in the x integration defining FL0 Terms of third order and higher in are also neglected0 The function is presumed to be normalized so that +A}, and due to the limited range ofwavelengths in there results +Aé, The result of these simplifications is that the integral becomes +Aö, = +Aü, The logarithm must be rewritten as an integral over the volume occupied by this integral can then be extended to an integral over the entire volume V when the contributions from all other integrations are included0 Also the logarithm must be expanded in powers of MH“ only the and terms will be kept0 Further it will be assumed that RL. changes slowly with L0 When L is at the correlation length A 1LY and RL. are equal +as already argued, so that for values of L intermediate between atomic sizes and the correlation length. R L. is small compared to A1LY0 Expanding the logarithm in powers of RL-GUt.Mi. to second order +to obtain an term, gives +of0 Eq0 +AA,,’ = terms independent of MH +A‘, One can rewrite as an integral over the volume There results the equations = (20) = (21) or (22) 110 Physics 1982 dL +Y], These equations are valid only for L for L > there is very little further change in RL. or UL. due to the switchover in the logarithm caused by the dom/ inance of RL rather than A1LY0 If d is greater than a. it can be seen that RL and UL are constant for large L. as expected in the Landau theory0 For example. if one assumes RL0 and UL0 are constant for large L it is easily seen that integration of +YY, and +Y], only gives negative powers of L0 For d”a the solutions are not constant0 Instead. UL behaves for sufficiently large L as ‘ +which is easily seen to be a solution of +Y],,. RL0 satisfies the equation whose solution is R L = ] +Y}, where c is related to the value of RL0 at some initial value of L0 For large enough L. t h e L/Y term can be neglected0 The parameter c should be analytic in temperature. in fact proportional to T/T.0 Hence. for large L which is analytic in T for fixed L0 However the equation for is Let +Yö, (28) ε = a/d +Y‘, then the correlation length exponent is A A which gives v = 20é in ] dimensions0 Similarly. the spontaneous magnetization below behaves as giving These computations give an indication of how non/trivial values can be obtained for β and v. The formulae derived here are not exact. due to the severe simplifications made. but at least they show that β and v do not have to be l1Y and in fact can have a complicated dependence on the dimension d0 A correct treatment is much more complex0 Once M H+x, is not treated as a K G. Wilson 111 constant. one could imagine expanding MH+x, in a Taylor’s series about its value at some central location x o relative to the location of the wavefunction thus bringing in gradients of MH0 In addition. higher order terms in the expansion of the logarithm give higher powers of MH0 All this leads to a more complex form for the free energy functional FL0 with more gradient terms and more powers of M H0 The whole idea of the expansion in powers of MH and powers of gradients can in fact be called into question0 The fluctuations have an intrinsic size +i0e0. m Y has a size LY as a consequence of the form of the integrand in Eq0 Aö, and it is not obvious that in the presence of these fluctuations. M is small0 Since arbitrary wavelengths of fluctuations are important the function M is not sufficiently slowly varying tojustify an expansion in gradients either0 This means that FL[M] could be an arbitrarily complicated function of M. an expression it is hard to write down. with thousands of parameters. instead of the simple Landau/Ginzburg form with only two parameters RL and UL0 Fortunately. the problem simplifies near a dimensions. due to the small magnitude of U L. which is proportional to ε = a/d0 All the complications neglected above arise only to second order or higher in an expansion in U L which means second order or higher in ε0 The computations described here are exact to order ε0 See Ref0 Aö0 The renormalization group approach that was defined in A‘öA embraces both practical approximations leading to actual computations and a formalism0 Aö The full formalism cannot be discussed here but the central idea of “fixed points” can be illustrated0 As the fluctuations on each length scale are integrated out a new free energy functional FL-δL is generated from the previous functional F L0 This process is repeated many times0 If FL and F L-δL are expressed in dimensionless form. then one finds that the transformation leading from FL to is repeated in identical form many times0 +The transformation group thus generated is called the “renor/ malization group\",0 As L becomes large the free energy FL approaches a fixed point of the transformation. and thereby becomes independent of details of the system at the atomic level0 This leads to an explanation of the universalityAü.. of critical behavior for different kinds of systems at the atomic level0 Liquid/gas transitions. magnetic transitions. alloy transitions. etc0 all show the same critical exponents experimentally“ theoretically this can be understood from the hy/ pothesis that the same “fixed point” interaction describes all these systems0 To demonstrate the fixed point form of the free energy functional. it must be put into dimensionless form0 Lengths need to be expressed in units of L. and M. R L. and UL rewritten in dimensionless form0 These changes are easily deter/ mined’ write x = Ly +]Y, M+x, = +]], R L. +]a, U L = +]}, F L = +]é, 112 Physics 1982 The asymptotic solution for the dimensionless parameters rL and uL0 is Apart from the term in rL. these dimensionless parameters are independent of L. denoting a free energy form which is also independent of L0 The c term designates an instability of the fixed point. namely a departure from the fixed point which grows as L increases0 The fixed point is reached only if the thermodynamic system is at the critical temperature for which c vanishes“ any departure from the critical temperature triggers the instability0 For further analysis of the renormalization group formalism and its relation to general ideas about critical behavior. see e0g0 ref0 Aö0 II I0 Some History Prior to 1971 The first description of a critical point was the description of the liquid/vapor critical point developed by Van der Waals.

namely e is obtained as the l o w m o m e n t u m limit of and eo is obtained as the high momentum limit of 114 Physics 1982 Gell.Mann and Low found that obeys a differentia2 equation- of the form “ (39) where the ϕ function has a simple power series expansion with non.divergent coefficients independently of the value of λ. in fact as λ→∞ ϕ becomes a function of alone/ This equation is the forerunner of my own renormalization group equations such as (33+ and (3A+/ The main observation of Gell.Mann and Low was that despite the ordinary nature of the differential equation- Eq/ (A±+- the solution was not ordinary- and in fact predicts that the physical charge e has divergences when expanded in powers of e o- or vice versa/ More generally- if is expanded in powers of the higher order coefficients contain powers of and these coefficients diverge if either λ or go to infinity- and are very large if is either very large or very small/ Furthermore- Gell.Mann and Low argued that- as a consequence of Eqn/ (A±+- eo- must have a fixed value independently of the value of e‘ the fixed value of e o could be either finite or infinite/ When I entered graduate school at California Institute of Technology- in 2é]a- the default for the most promising students was to enter elementary particle theory- the field in which Murray Gell.Mann- Richard Feynman- and Jon Mathews were all engaged/ I rebelled briefly against this default- spending a summer at the General Atomic Corp/ working for Marshall Rosenbluth on plasma physics and talking with S/ Chandrasekhar who was also at General Atomic for the summer/ After about a month of work I was ordered to write up my results- as a result of which I swore to myself that I would choose a subject for research where it would take at least five years before I had anything worth writing about/ Elementary particle theory seemed to offer the best prospects of meeting this criterion and I asked Murray for a problem to work on/ He first suggested a topic in weak interactions of strongly interacting particles (K mesons- etc/+ After a few months I got disgusted with trying to circumvent totally unknown consequences of strong interactions- and asked Murray to find me a problem dealing with strong interactions directly- since they seemed to be the bottleneck/ Murray suggested I study K meson.nucleon scattering using the Low equation in the one meson approximation/ I wasn’t very impressed with the methods then in use to solve the Low equation- so I wound up fiddling with various methods to solve the simpler case of pion.nucleon scattering/ Despite the fact that the one meson approximation was valid- if at all- only for low ener. gies- I studied the high energy limit- and found that I could perform a “leading logarithms” sum very reminiscent of a very mysterious chapter in Bogoliubov and Shirkov’s field theory textA2 ‘ the chapter was on the renormalization group/ In 2éa1 I turned in a thesis to Cal Tech containing a mish.mash of curious calculations/ I was already a Junior Fellow at Harvard/ In 2éa3 I went to CERN for a year/ During this period (2éa1.2éaA+ I partly followed the fashions of the time/ Fixed source meson theory (the basis for the Low equation+ died- to be replaced by S matrix theory/ I reinvented the “strip approximation” (Ter. Martirosyan had invented it firstA3+ and studied the Amati.Fubini.Stanghellini K G. Wilson 115 theory of multiple production0 ]] I was attentive at seminars +the only period of my life when I was willing to stay fully awake in them, and I also pursued back waters such as the strong coupling approximation to fixed source meson theory? By 2éaA it was clear that the only subject I wanted to pursue was quantum field theory applied to strong interactions/ I rejected S matrix theory because the equations of S matrix theory- even if one could write them down- were too complicated and inelegant to be a theory‘ in contrast the existence of a strong coupling approximation as well as a weak coupling approximation to fixed source meson theory helped me believe that quantum field theory might make sense/ As far as strong interactions were concerned- all that one could say was that the theories one could write down- such as pseudoscalar meson theory- were obviously wrong/ No one had any idea of a theory that could be correct/ One could make these statements even though no one had the foggiest notion how to solve these theories in the strong coupling domain/ My very strong desire to work in quantum field did not seem likely to lead to quick publications‘ but I had already found out that I seemed to be able to get jobs even if I didn’t publish anything so I did not worry about ‘publish or perish’ questions/ There was very little I could do in quantum field theory . there were very few people working in the subject- very few problems open for study/ In the period 2éaA.2éaa I had to clutch at straws/ I thought about the “ξ.limiting” process of Lee and Yang/” I spent a major effort disproving Ken Johnson’s claims”’ that he could define quantum electrodynamics for arbitrarily small eo- in total contradiction to the result of Gell.Mann and Low/ I listened to K/ Hepp and others describe their results in axiomatic field theoryA|‘ I didn’t understand what they said in detail but I got the message that I should think in position space rather than momentum space/ I translated some of the work I had done on Feynman diagrams with some very large momenta (to disprove Ken Johnson’s ideas+ into position space and arrived at a short distance expansion for products of quantum field operators/ I described a set of rules for this expansion in a preprint in 2éaY/ I submitted the paper for publication‘ the referee suggested that the solution of the Thirring model might illustrate this expansion/ Unfor. tunately- when I checked out the Thirring model- I found that while indeed there was a short distance expansion for the Thirring model-A± my rules for how the coefficient functions behaved were all wrong- in the strong coupling domain/ I put the preprint aside- awaiting resolution of the problem/ Having learned the fixed source meson theory as a graduate student- I con. tinued to think about it/ I applied my analysis of Feynman diagrams for some large momenta- to the fixed source model/ I realized that the results I was getting became much clearer if I made a simplification of the fixed source model itself- in which the momentum space continuum was replaced by momentum slices/Aé That is- I rubbed out all momenta except well separated slices- e/g/- 2 3- - Λ n etc/ with A a large number0 This model could be solved by a perturbation theory very different from the methods previously used in field theory/ The energy scales for each slice were 116 Physics 1982 very different- namely of order Λ n for the n th slice/ Hence the natural procedure was to treat the Hamiltonian for the largest momentum slice as the unperturbed Hamiltonian- and the terms for all lesser slices as the perturbation/ In each slice the Hamiltonian contained both a free meson energy term and an interaction term- so this new perturbation method was neither a weak coupling nor a strong coupling perturbation/ I showed that the effect of this perturbation approach was that if one started with n momentum slices- and selected the ground state of the unperturbed Hamiltonian for the nth slice- one wound up with an effective Hamiltonian for the remaining n.l slices/ This new Hamiltonian was identical to the original Hamiltonian with only n.l slices kept- except that the meson.nucleon coupling constant g was renormalized (i/e/- modified+ö the modification was a factor in. volving a non.trivial matrix element of the ground state of the n th.slice Hamil. tonian/ Aé This work was a real breakthrough for me/ For the first time I had found a natural basis for renormalization group analysisö namely the solution and elim. ination of one momentum scale from the problem/ There was still much to be doneö but I was no longer grasping at straws/ My ideas about renormalization were now reminiscent of Dyson’s analysis of Quantum Electrodynamics/“’ Dyson argued that renormalization in Quantum Electrodynamics should be carried out by solving and eliminating high energies before solving low energies/ I studied Dyson’s papers carefully but was unable to make much use of his work/” Following this development- I thought very hard about the question “what is a field theory”- using the φ + interaction of a scalar field (identical with the Landau.Ginzburg model of a critical point 2Y discussed in my 2é|2 papers+ as an example/ Thoughout the ‘a1’s I taught quantum mechanics frequently- and I was very impressed by one’s ability to understand simple quantum mechanical systems/ The first step is a qualitative analysis minimizing the energy (defined by the Hamiltonian+ using the uncertainty principle‘ the second step might be a variational calculation with wavefunctions constructed using the qualitative information from the first step‘ the final stage (for high accuracy+ would be a numerical computation with a computer helping to achieve high precision/ I felt that one ought to be able to understand a field theory the same way/ I realized that I had to think about the degrees of freedom that make up a field theory/ The problem of solving the φ 4 theory was that kinetic term in the Hamiltonian (involving was diagonal only in terms of the Fourier com. ponents of the field- whereas the φ + term was diagonal only in terms of the field itself/ Therefore I looked for a compromise representation in which both the kinetic term and the interaction term would be at least roughly diagonal/ I needed to expand the field x + i n terms of wavefunctions that would have minimum extent in both position space and momentum space- in other words wavefunctions occupying the minimum amount of volume in phase space/ The uncertainty principle defines the lower bound for this volume- namely 2- in suitable units/ I thought of phase space being divided up into blocks of unit volume/ The momentum slice analysis indicated that momentum space should be marked off on a logarithmic scale- i/e/ each momentum space volume should K G. Wilson 117 correspond to a shell like the slices defined earlier- except that I couldn’t leave out any momentum range so the shells had to be e/g////- 2 ’ |k| ’ 3- 3 ’ ’ Y- etc/ By translational invariance the position space blocks would all be the same size for a given momentum shell- and would define a simple lattice of blocks/ The position space blocks would have different sizes for different momentum shells/ When I tried to study this Hamiltonian I didn’t get very far/ It was clear that the low momentum terms should be a perturbation relative to the high momen. tum terms but the details of the perturbative treatment became too complicated/ Also my analysis was too crude to identify the physics of highly relativistic particles which should be contained in the Hamiltonian of the field theory/” However- I learned from this picture of the Hamiltonian that the Hamiltonian would have to be cutoff at some large but finite value of momentum k in order to make any sense out of it- and that once it was cutoff- I basically had a lattice theory to deal with- the lattice corresponding roughly to the position space blocks for the largest momentum scale/ More precisely- the sensible procedure for defining the lattice theory was to define phase space cells covering all of the cutoff momentum space- in which case there would be a single set of position space blocks- which in turn defined a position space lattice on which the field φ w o u l d be defined/ I saw from this that to understand quantum field theories I would have to understand quantum field theories on a lattice/ In thinking and trying out ideas about “what is a field theory” I found it very helpful to demand that a correctly formulated field theory should be soluble by computer- the same way an ordinary differential equation can be solved on a computer- namely with arbitrary accuracy in return for sufficient computing power/ It was clear- in the ‘a1’s- that no such computing power was available in practice‘ all that I was able to actually carry out were some simple exercises involving free fields on a finite lattice/ In the summer of 2éaa I spent a long time at Aspen/ While there I carried out a promise I had made to myself while a graduate student- namely I worked through Onsager’s solution of the two dimensional Ising model/ I read it in translation- studying the field theoretic form given in Lieb- Mattis and Schultz/‘” When I entered graduate school- I had carried out the instructions given to me by my father and had knocked on both Murray Gell.Mann’s and Feynman’s doors- and asked them what they were currently doing/ Murray wrote down the partition function for the three dimensional Ising model and said it would be nice if I could solve it (at least that is how I remember the conversation+/ Feynman’s answer was “nothing”/ Later- Jon Mathews explained some of Feynman’s tricks for reproducing the solution for the two dimensional Ising model/ I didn’t follow what Jon was saying- but that was when I made my promise/ Sometime before going to Aspen- I was present when Ben Widom presented his scaling equation of state- 3A in a seminar at Cornell/ I was puzzled by the absence of any theoretical basis for the form Widom wrote down‘ I was at that time completely ignorant of the background in critical phenomena that made Widom’s work an important development/ As I worked through the paper of Mattis- Lieb- and Schultz- I realized there 118 Physics 1982 should be applications of my renormalization group ideas to critical phenomena- and discussed this with some of the solid state physicists also at Aspen/ I was informed that I had been scooped by Leo Kadanoff and should look at his pre. p r i n t /A 1 Kadanoff's idea was that near the critial point one could think of blocks of magnetic moments- for example containing 3x3x3 atoms per block- which would act like a single effective moment- and these effective moments would have a simple nearest neighbor interaction like simple models of the original system/ The only change would be that the system would have an effective temperature and external magnetic field that might be distinct from the original/ More generally the effective moments would exist on a lattice of arbitrary spacing L times the original atomic spacing‘ Kadanoffs idea was that there would be L.dependent temperature and field variables T L/ and hL- and that T3 L- and h3 L/ would be analytic functions of TL/ and hL/ At the critical point- TL- and hL- would have fixed values independent of L/ From this hypothesis Kadanoff was able to derive the scaling laws of Widom- 3A Fisher- etc/3Y I now amalgamated my thinking about field theories on a lattice and critical phenomena/ I learned about Euclidean (imaginary time+ quantum field theory and the “transfer matrix” method for statistical mechanical models and found there was a close analogy between the two (see Ref/ 2|+/ I learned that for a field theory to be relativistic- the corresponding statistical mechanical theory had to have a large correlation length- i/e/- be near a critical point/ I studied Schiff’s strong coupling approximation to the φ4theory-YY and found that he had ignored renormalization effects‘ when these were taken into account the strong coupling expansion was no longer so easy as he claimed/ I thought about the implications of the scaling theory of Kadanoff- Widom et al/ applied to quantum field theory- along with the scale invariance of the solution of the Thirring model” and the discussion of Kastrup and Mack of scale invariance in quantum field theory/Y] These ideas suggested that scale invariance would apply- at least at short distances- but that field operators would have non.trivial scale dimensions corresponding to the non.trivial exponents in critical phenomena/ I redid my theory of short distance expansions based on these scaling ideas and published the result/Ya My theory did not seem to lit the main experimental ideas about short distance behavior (coming from Bjorken’s and Feynman’s analysis Y | of deep inelastic electron scattering+ but I only felt confused about this problem and did not worry about it/ I returned to the fixed source theory and the momentum slice approximation/ I made further simplifications on the model/ Then I did the perturbative analysis more carefully/ Since in real life the momentum slice separation factor Λ would be 3 instead of very large- the ratio 20Λ of successive energy scales would be l03 rather than very small- and an all orders perturbative treatment was required in 20Λ/ When the lower energy scales were treated to all orders relative to the high. est energy scale- an infinitely complicated effective Hamiltonian was generated- with an infinite set of coupling constants/ Each time an energy scale was elimin. ated through a perturbative treatment- a new infinitely complicated Hamil. tonian was generated/ Nevertheless- I found that for sufficiently large Λ I could K. G. Wilson 119 mathematically control rigorously the effective Hamiltonians that were gener. ated‘ despite the infinite number of couplings I was able to prove that the higher orders of perturbation theory had only a small and boundable impact on the effective Hamiltonians- even after arbitrarily many iterations/Y± This work showed me that a renormalization group transformation- whose purpose was to eliminate an energy scale or a length scale or whatever from a problem- could produce an effective interaction with arbitrarily many coupling constants- without being a disaster/ The renormalization group formalism based on fixed points could still be correct- and furthermore one could hope that only a small finite number of these couplings would be important for the qualitative behavior of the transformations- with the remaining couplings being important only for quantitative computations/ In other words the couplings should have an order of importance- and for any desired but given degree of accuracy only a finite subset of the couplings would be needed/ In my model the order of import. ance was determined by orders in the expansion in powers of l0Λ/ I realized however that in the framework of an interaction on a lattice- especially for Ising.type models- locality would provide a natural order of importance . in any finite lattice volume there are only a finite number of Ising spin inter. actions that can be defined/ I decided that Kadanoffs emphasis on the nearest neighbor coupling of the Ising modelA1 should be restatedö the nearest neighbor coupling would be the most important coupling because it is the most localized coupling one can define- but other couplings would be present also in Kadanoff's effective “block spin” Hamiltonians/ A reasonable truncation procedure on these couplings would be to consider a finite region- say A A or YA lattice sites in size- and consider only multispin couplings that could fit into these regions (plus translations and rotations of these couplings+/ Previously all the renormalization group transformations I was familiar with involved a fixed number of couplingsö in the Gell.Mann.Low case just the electric charge in Kadanoffs case an effective temperature and external field/ I had tried many ways to try to derive transformationsjust for these fixed number ofcouplings- without success/ Liberated from this restriction- it turned out to be easy to define renormalization group transformations‘ the hard problem was to find approximations to these transformations which would be computable in practice/ Indeed a number renormalization group transformations now exist (see Section IV and its references+/ In the fall of 2é|1 Ben Widom asked me to address his statistical mechanics seminar on the renormalization group/ He was particularly interested because Di Castro and Jona.Lisinio had proposed applying the field theoretic renormal. ization group formalism to critical phenomena-Yé but no one in Widom’s group could understand Di Castro and Jona.Lasinio’s paper/ In the course oflecturing on the general ideas of fixed points and the like I realized I would have to provide a computable example- even if it was not accurate or reliable/ I applied the phase space cell analysis to the Landau.Ginzburg model of the critical point and tried to simplify it to the point of a calculable equation- making no demands for accuracy but simply trying to preserve the essence of the phase space cell picture/ The result was a recursion formula in the form of a nonlinear integral trans. 120 Physics 1982 formation on a function of one variable- which I was able to solve by iterating the transformation on a computer/]1 I was able to compute numbers for expo. nents from the recursion formula at the same time that I could show (at least in part+ that it had a fixed point and that the scaling theory of critical phenomena of Widom et al/ followed from the fixed point formalism/ Two papers of 2é|2 on the renormalization group presented this work/]1 Some months later I was showing Michael Fisher some numerical results from the recursion formula- when we realized- together- that the nontrivial fixed point I was studying became trivial at four dimensions and ought to be easy to study in the vicinity of four dimensions/ The dimension d appeared in a simple way as a parameter in the recursion formula and working out the details was straightforward‘ Michael and I published a letter]2 with the results/ It was almost immediately evident that the same analysis could be applied to the full Landau.Ginzberg model without the approximations that went into the recur. sion formula/ Since the simplifying principle was the presence of a small co. efficient of the φ a term- a Feynman diagram expansion was in order/ I used my field theoretic training to crank out the diagrams and my understanding of the renormalization group fixed point formalism to determine how to make use of the diagrams I computed/ The results were published in a second letter in early 2 é | 3 /]3 The consequent explosion of research is discussed in Part IV/ There were independent efforts on the same area taking place while I com. pleted my work/ The connection between critical phenomena and quantum field theory was recognized by Gribov and Migdal and Polyakov ]A and by axiom. atic field theorists such as Symanzik]Y T/T/ Wu ]] worked on both field theory and the Ising model/ Larkin and Khmelnitskii applied the field theoretic renor. malization group of Gell.Mann and Low to critical phenomena in four dimen. sions and to the special case of uniaxial ferromagnets in three dimensions- ]a i n both cases deriving logarithmic corrections to Landau’s theory/ Dyson formu. lated a somewhat artificial “hierarchical” model of a phase transition which was exactly solved by a one dimensional integral recursion formula/ ]Y This formula was almost identical to the one I wrote down later- in the 2é|2 paper/ Anderson’ worked out a simple but approximate procedure for eliminating mo. mentum scales in the Kondo problem- anticipating my own work in the Kondo problem (see Sec/ IV+/ Many solid state theorists were trying to apply diagram. matic expansions to critical phenomena- and Abe]± and Scalapino and Ferrell ]é laid the basis for a diagrammatic treatment of models with a large number of degrees offreedom- for any dimension/ (The limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom had already been solved by Stanleya1+/ Kadanoff was making exten. sive studies of the Ising model-a2and discovered a short distance expansion for it similar to my own expansion for Geld theories/ Fractional dimensions had been thought about before in critical phenomena/a3 Continuation of Feynman diagrams to non.integer dimensions was introduced into quantum Geld theory in order to provide a gauge invariant regularization procedure for non.abelian gauge theoriesöaA this was done about simultaneously with its use to develop the ε expansion/ In the late ‘a1’s- Migdal and PolyakovaY developed a “bootstrap” formulation K. G. Wilson 121 of critical phenomena based on a skeleton Feynman graph expansion- in which all parameters including the expansion parameter inself would be determined self.consistently/ They were unable to solve the bootstrap equations because of their complexity- although after the ε expansion about four dimensions was discovered- Mack showed that the bootstrap could be solved to lowest order in ε 651 If the 2é|2 renormalization group ideas had not been developed- the Migdal. Polyakov bootstrap would have been the most promising framework of its time f o r t r y i n g t o f u r t h e r u n d e r s t a n d c r i t i c a l p h e n o m e n a / H o w e v e r - t h e r e n o r . malization group methods have proved both easier to use and more versatile- and the bootstrap receives very little attention today/ In retrospect the bootstrap solved a problem I tried and failed to solve‘ namely how to derive the Gell.Mann.Low and Kadanoff dream of a fixed point involv. ing only one or two couplings . there was only one coupling constant to be determined in the Migdal.Polyakov bootstrap/ However- I found the bootstrap approach unacceptable because prior to the discovery of the ε e x p a n s i o n n o formal argument was available to justify truncating the skeleton expansion to a finite number of terms/ Also the skeleton diagrams were too complicated to test the truncation in practice by means of brute force computation of a large number of diagrams/ Even today- as I review the problems that remain unsolved either by ε expansion or renormalization group methods- the problem of convergence of the skeleton expansion leaves me unenthusiastic about pursuing the bootstrap approach- although its convergence has never actually been tested/ In the mean. time- the Monte Carlo Renormalization groupaa has recently provided a frame. work for using small number of couplings in a reasonably effective and non. perturbative wayö see Section IV/ I am not aware of any other independent work trying to understand the re. normalization group from first principles as a means to solve field theory or critical phenomena one length scale at a time- or suggesting that the renor. malization group should be formulated to allow arbitrarily many couplings to appear at intermediate stages of the analysis/ IV/ Results after 1971 There was an explosion of activity after 2é|3 in both renormalization group and E expansion studies/ To review everything that has taken place since 2é|3 would be hopeless/ I have listed a number of review papers and books which provide more detailed information at the end of this paper/ Some principal results and some thoughts for the future will be outlined here/ The “ε expansion” about four dimensions gave reasonable qualitative results for three dimensional systems/ It enabled a much greater variety of details of critical behavior to be studied than was previously possible beyond the mean field level/ The principal critical point is characterized by two parametersö the dimension d and the number of internal components n/ Great efforts were made to map out critical behavior as a function of d and n/ ε expansion and related small coupling expansions were carried to very high orders by Brézin- Le Guillou- Zinn.Justin- a| and Nickel”” led to precise results for d A / a é / | 1 The large n limit and l0n expansion was pursued further/” A new expansion in 2 + ε dimensions was 122 Physics 1982 developed for n”3 by Polyakov/ | 3 For n “ 2 there is an expansion in 2,ε dimensions/ |A The full equation of state in the critical region was worked out in the ε e x p a n s i o n| Y and l0n expansion/ |] The special case n “ 1 was shown by De Gennes to describe the excluded volume problem in polymer configuration problems and random walks/|a Corrections to scaling were first considered by W e g n e r ||/ A recent reference is Aharony and Ahlers/|± Besides the careful study of the principal critical point other types of critical points and critical behavior were pursued/ Tricritical phenomena were in. vestigated by Riedel and Wegner- |é where Landau theory was found to break. down starting in three dimensions instead of four/ ±1 More general multicritical points have been analyzed/±2 Effects of dipolar forces-±3 other long range forces-±A c u b i c p e r t u r b a t i o n s a n d a n i s o t r o p i e s ± Y -

The fixed point of Kadanoff's decimation transformation depends on a single arbitrary parameter‘ it was possible to determine a best value for this parameter from internal consistency consider. 124 Physics 1982 ations/ Complex calculations with potentially serious errors always are most effective when an optimization principle is available and parameters exist to optimize on/ 23A This research has never been followed up- as is often the case when large scale computing is involved/ More recently- the Monte Carlo Re. normalization group method-aa developed by Swendsen- myself- Shenker- and Tobochnik (see also Hilhorst and Van Leeuwen+“’ has proved very accurate and may shortly overtake both the high temperature expansions and the ε expansion as the most accurate source of data on the three dimensional Ising model/ The Monte Carlo Renormalization Group is currently most successful on tw o dimensional problems where computing requirements are less severeö it has been applied successfully to tricritical models and the four.state Potts model/ 23Y I n contrast- the ε expansion is all but useless for two dimensional problems/ Unfortunately- none of the real space methods as yet provide the detailed information about correlation functions and the like that are easily derived in the ε expansion/ A serious problem with the renormalization group transformations (real space or otherwise+ is that there is no guarantee that they will exhibit fixed points/ Bell and myself23] and Wegner in a more general and elegant way22A have shown that for some renormalization group transformations- iteration of a critical point does not lead to a fixed point- presumably yielding instead interactions with increasingly long range forces/ There is no known principle for avoiding this possibility- and as Kadanoff has showed using his decimation procedure-231 a simple approximation to a transformation can misleadingly give a fixed point even when the full transformation cannot/ The treatment that I gave of the two dimensional Ising model has self consistency checks that signal immediately when long range forces outside the Y2± interactions kept are becoming important/ Nothing is known yet about how the absence of a fixed point would be manifested in the Monte Carlo renormalization group computations/ Cautions about real space renormalization group methods have also been advanced by Griffiths et a l /2 3 a There is a murky connection between scaling ideas in critical phenomena and Mandelbrot’s “fractals” theory . a theory of scaling of irregular geometrical structures (such as coastlines+/23| Renormalization group methods have been applied to areas other than critical phenomena/ The Kondo problem is one example/ Early renormalization group work was by Anderson” and Fowler and Zawadowski/ 23± I then carried out a very careful renormalization group analysis of the Kondo Hamiltonian- 23é producing effective Hamiltonians with many couplings for progressively smaller energy scales- following almost exactly the prescription I learned for fixed source meson theory/ The result was the zero.temperature susceptibility to about 2 % accu. racy- which was subsequently confirmed by Andrei and Wiegmann’s | exact solution/ Renormalization group methods have been applied to other Hamil. tonian problems- mostly one dimensional/2A1 In multidimensional systems and in many one dimensional systems- the effective Hamiltonians presently involve too many states to be manageable/ The renormalization group has played a key role in the development of Quan. K. G. Wilson 125 turn Chromodynamics . the current theory of quarks and nuclear forces/ The original Gell.Mann Low theory3é and the variant due to Callan and Symanzik 221 was used by Politzer- Gross and Wilczek 2 A 2 t o s h o w t h a t n o n a b e l i a n g a u g e theories are asymptotically free/ This means that the short distance couplings are weak but increase as the length scale increases‘ it is now clear that this is the only sensible framework which can explain- qualitatively- the weak coupling that is evident in the analysis of deep inelastic electron scattering results (off protons and neutrons+ and the strong coupling which is evident in the binding of quarks to form protons- neutrons- mesons- etc/2A3 I should have anticipated the idea of asymptotic freedom2AA but did not do so/ Unfortunately- it has been hard to study quantum chromodynamics in detail because of the effects of the strong binding of quarks at nuclear distances- which cannot be treated by diagram. matic methods/ The development of the lattice gauge theory by Polyakov and myself2AY following pioneering work of Wegner 2A] has made possible the use of a variety of lattice methods on the problems of quantum chromodynamics- 2Aa in. cluding strong coupling expansions- Monte Carlo simulations- and the Monte Carlo renormalization group methods/a|- 2A| As computers become more powerful I expect there will be more emphasis on various modern renormalization group methods in these lattice studies- in order to take accurately into account the crossover from weak coupling at short distances to strong coupling at nuclear distances/ The study of unified theories ofstrong- weak and electromagnetic interactions makes heavy use of the renormalization group viewpoint/ At laboratory energies the coupling strengths of the strong and electromagnetic interactions are too disparate to be unified easily/ Instead- a unification energy scale is postulated at roughly 212] GeV‘ in between renormalization group equations cause the strong and electroweak couplings to approach each other- making unification possible/ Many grand unified theories posit important energy scales in the region between 2 and 212] GeV/ It is essential to think about these theories one energy scale at a time to help sort out the wide range of phenomena that are predicted in these theories/ See Langacker 2A± for a review/ The study of grand unification has made it clear that Lagrangians describing laboratory energies are phenomenological rather than fundamental- and this continues to be the case through the grand unification scale- until scales are reached where quantum gravity is important/ It has been evident for a long time that there should be applications of the renor. malization group to turbulence- but not much success has been achieved yet/ Feigenbaum 2A± developed a renormalization group.like treatment of the conver. sion from order to chaos in some simple dynamical systems-2Y1 and this work may have applications to the onset of turbulence/ Feigenbaum’s method is prob. ably too specialized to be of broader use- but dynamical systems may be a good starting point for developing more broadly based renormalization group methods applicable to classical partial differential equations/2Y2 In my view the extensive research that has already been carried out using the renormalization group and the ε expansion is only the beginning of the study of a much larger range of applications that will be discovered over the next twenty years (or perhaps the next century will be required+/ The quick successes 126 Physics 1982 of the ε expansion are now past- and I believe progress now will depend rather on the more difficult- more painful exercises such as my own computations on the two dimensional Ising model and the Kondo problem-231 or the Monte Carlo Renormalization group a a computations/ Often these highly quantitative- de. manding computations will have to precede simpler qualitative analysis in order to be certain the many traps potentially awaiting any renormalization group analysis have been avoided/ Important potential areas of application include the theory of the chemical bond- where an effective interaction describing molecules at the bond level is desperately needed to replace current ab initio computations starting at the individual electron level/2Y3 A method for understanding high energy or large momentum transfer Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD+ cross sections (in. cluding non.perturbative effects+ is needed which will enable large QCD back. grounds to be computed accurately and subtracted away from experimental results intended to reveal smaller non.QCD effects/ Practical areas like per. colation- frost heaving- crack propagation in metals- and the metallurgical quench all involve very complex microscopic physics underlying macroscopic effects- and most likely yield a mixture of some problems exhibiting fluctuations on all length scales and other problems which become simpler classical problems without fluctuations in larger scales/ I conclude with some general references/ Two semi.popular articles on the renormalization group are Wilson
