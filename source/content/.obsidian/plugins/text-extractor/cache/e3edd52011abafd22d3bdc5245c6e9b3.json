Experimental Test of Parity Conservation in Beta Decay* C. S. WU, Cotumbia University, 1Vem York, %em York AND E. AMBLER) R. W. HAYwARD) D. D. HQPPEs) AND R, P. HUDsoN) National, Bureau of Standards, W'ashington, D. C. (Received January 15, 1957) ' 'N a recent paper' on the question of parity in weak ~ - interactions, Lee and Yang critically surveyed the experimental information concerning this question and reached the conclusion that there is no existing evidence either to support or to refute parity conservation in weak interactions. They proposed a number of experiments on beta decays and hyperon and meson decays which would provide the necessary evidence for parity conservation or nonconservation. In beta decay, one could measure the angular distribution of the electrons coming from beta decays of polarized nuclei. If an asymmetry in the distribution between 8 and 180'—8 (where 8 is the angle between the orientation of the parent nuclei and the momentum of the electrons) is observed, it provides unequivocal proof that parity is not conserved in beta decay. This asymmetry effect has been observed in the case of oriented Co~. It has been known for some time that Co\" nuclei can be polarized by the Rose-Gorter method in cerium magnesium (cobalt) nitrate, and the degree of polari- zation detected by measuring the anisotropy of the succeeding gamma rays.

The beta-particle counter should be placedi~side the demagnetization cryostat, and the radioactive nuclei must be located in a thin surface layer and polarized. The schematic diagram of the cryostat is shown in Fig. 1. To detect beta particles, a thin anthracene crystal —,'in. in diameter)& —,'6 in. thick is located inside the vacuum chamber about 2 cm above the Co~ source. The scintillations are transmitted through a glass window and a Lucite light pipe 4 feet long to a photo- multiplier (6292) which is located at the top of the cryostat. The Lucite head is machined to a logarithmic spiral shape for maximum light collection. Under this condition, the Cs\"' conversion line (624 kev) still retains a resolution of 17%. The stability of the beta counter was carefully checked for any magnetic or temperature effects and none were found. To measure the amount of polarization of Co\", two additional NaI gamma scintillation counters were installed, one in the equatorial plane and one near the polar position. The observed gamma-ray anisotropy was used as a measure of polarization, and, effectively, temperature. The bulk susceptibility was also mon- itored but this is of secondary significance due to surface heating effects, and the gamma-ray ani- sotropy alone provides a reliable measure of nuclear polarization. Specimens were made by taking good single crystals of cerium magnesium nitrate and growing on the upper surface only an additional crystalline layer containing Co\".

Gamma anisotropy and beta asymmetry for polarizing field pointing up and pointing down. one unit and no change of parity, it can be given only by the Gamow-Teller interaction. This is almost im- perative for this experiment. The thickness of the radioactive layer used was about 0.002 inch and con- tained a few microcuries of activity. Upon demagnetiza- tion, the magnet is opened and a vertical solenoid is raised around the lower part of the cryostat. The whole process takes about 20 sec. The beta and gamma counting is then started. The beta pulses are analyzed on a 10-channel pulse-height analyzer with a counting interval of 1 minute, and a recording interval of about 40 seconds. The two gamma counters are biased to accept only the pulses from the photopeaks in order to discriminate against pulses from Compton scattering. A large beta asymmetry was observed. In Fig. 2 we have plotted the gamma anisotropy and beta asym- metry vs time for polarizing field pointing up and pointing down. The time for disappearance of the beta asymmetry coincides well with that of gamma ani- sotropy. The warm-up time is generally about 6 minutes, and the warm counting rates are independent of the field direction. The observed beta asymmetry does not change sign with reversal of the direction of the de- magnetization field, indicating that it is not caused by remanent magnetization in the sample. The sign of the asymmetry coeAicient, o., is negative, that is, the emission of beta particles is more favored in the direction opposit. e to that of the nuclear spin. This naturally implies that the sign for Cr and Cr' (parity conserved and pa. rity not conserved) must be opposite. The exact evaluation of o. is difficult because of the many eA'ects involved. The lower limit of n can be estimated roughly, however, from the observed value of asymmetry corrected for backscattering. AL velocity v(c=0.6, the value of n is about 0.4. The value of (I,)/I can be calculated from the observed anisotropy of the gamma radiation to be about 0.6. These two quantities give the lower limit of the asymmetry parameter P(n P(=I,)/I) approximately equal to 0.7. In order to evaluate o, accurately, many supplementary experiments must be carried out to determine the various correction factors. It is estimated here only to show the large asymmetry effect. According to I-ee and Yang' the present experiment indicates not only that conservation of parity is violated but also that invari- ance under charge conjugation is violated. 4 Further- more, the invariance under time reversal can also be decided from the momentum dependence of the asym- metry parameter P. This effect will be studied later. The double nitrate cooling salt has a highly aniso- tropic g value. If the symmetry axis of a crysial is not set parallel to the polarizing field, a small magnetic field vill be produced perpendicular to the latter. To check whether the beta asymmetry could be caused by such a magnetic field distortion, we allowed a drop of CoC12 solution to dry on a thin plastic disk and cemented the disk to the bottom of the same housing. In this way the cobalt nuclei should not be cooled su%ciently to produce an appreciable nuclear polarization, whereas the housing will behave as before. The large beta asym- mef. ry was not observed. Furthermore, to investigate possible internal magnetic effects on the paths of the electrons as they find their way to the surface of the crystal, we prepared another source by rubbing CoC1& solution on the surface of the cooling salt until a reasonable amount of the crystal was dissolved. AVe then allowed the solution to dry. No beta asymmetry was observed with this specimen. 3lore rigorous experimental checks are being initi- ated, but in view of the important implications of these observations, we report them now in the hope that they Diay stimulate and encourage further experimental investigations on the parity question in either beta or hyperon and meson decays.

They also point out that the longitudinal polarization of the muons offers a natural way of determining the magnetic moment. ' Confirmation of this proposal in the form of preliminary results on P decay of oriented nuclei by Wu et aL reached us before this experiment was begun. 6 By stopping, in carbon, the p+ beam formed by for- ward decay in Right of x+ mesons inside the cyclotron, we have performed the meson experiment', which establishes the following facts: I.

The meson beam is extracted from the Nevis cyclotron in the conventional manner, undergoing about 120' of magnetic defiection in the cyclotron fringing field and about —30 of deflection and mild focusing upon emerging from the 8-ft shielding wall. The positive beam contains about 10'~ of muons which originate principally in the vicinity of the cyclot. ron target by pion decay-in-Bight. Eight inches of carbon are used in the entrance t.elescope to separate the muons, the mean range of the \"85-\"3Iev pions being 5 in. of carbon. This arrangement brings a maximum number of muons to rest in the carbon target. The stopping of a muon is signalled by a fast 1—2 coincidence count. The subsequent beta decay of the muon is detected by the electron telescope 3—4 which normally requires a particle of range )II g/cm'( 25-3&fev electrons) to register. This arrangement has been used to measure the lifetimes of p+ and p, mesons in a vast number of elements. ' Counting rates are normally 20 electrons/ FIG. 1. Experimental arrangement.
