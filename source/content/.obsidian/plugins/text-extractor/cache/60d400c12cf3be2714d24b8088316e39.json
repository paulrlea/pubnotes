𝑉 𝑥 = 1 2 𝑘𝑥2 = 1 2 𝑚𝜔2𝑥2 where 𝜔 = 𝑘 𝑚 • So the Schrodinger Equation is: − ℏ2 2𝑚 𝜕2𝜓 𝜕𝑥2 + 1 2 𝑚𝜔2𝑥2𝜓 = 𝐸𝜓 • This is a difficult problem. We’ll approach it by trying to factor out the behavior of the solution for very large x. 4 To be consistent with Appendix B1 in Townsend, we change variables to avoid writing constants repeatedly. (Let 𝑦 = 𝑚𝜔 ℏ 𝑥, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜖 = 2𝐸 ℏ𝜔) 𝜕2𝜓 𝜕𝑦2 = 𝑦2 − 𝜖 𝜓 Find the approximate solution for large y. 𝜕2𝜓 𝜕𝑦2 ≈ 𝑦2𝜓 Solution: 𝜓 𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 𝑦 = 𝐴𝑦𝑛𝑒−𝑦2 2 5 • Any polynomial in y, times the exponential decay term 𝑒−𝑦2 2 will satisfy the large y equation. • Now we can see what polynomials (𝐻(𝑦)) can satisfy the full equation, and what conditions they impose on the energy. 𝑑2𝐻 𝑦 𝑒−𝑦2 2 𝑑𝑦2 = 𝑦2 − 𝜖 𝐻 𝑦 𝑒−𝑦2 2 𝑑𝜓 𝑑𝑦 = −𝑦𝐻 𝑦 𝑒−𝑦2 2 + 𝑒−𝑦2 2 𝑑𝐻 𝑑𝑦 𝑑2𝜓 𝑑𝑦2 = −𝐻𝑒−𝑦2 2 − 𝑦 𝑑𝐻 𝑑𝑦 𝑒−𝑦2 2 + 𝑒−𝑦2 2 𝑑2𝐻 𝑑𝑦2 6 • Plugging it all back in and factoring out the exponential term yields a differential equation for H. 𝑑2𝐻 𝑑𝑦2 − 2𝑦 𝑑𝐻 𝑑𝑦 + 𝜖 − 1 𝐻 = 0 This equation is known as the Hermite equation. The lowest order polynomial we could guess is H=constant=𝑎0. Let’s try it. 𝜖 − 1 𝑎0 = 0 Which is a solution if 𝜖 = 1! So 𝐸0 = ℏ𝜔 2 !! 7 • So the lowest order solution to the harmonic oscillator potential is 𝜓0 = 𝑎0𝑒−𝑚𝜔 ℏ 𝑥2 And normalizing, 𝑎0 2 න −∞ ∞ 𝑒−2𝑚𝜔 ℏ 𝑥2𝑑𝑥 = 1 And looking up the integral, 𝑎0 2 = 𝑚𝜔 𝜋ℏ 1 2 So 𝜓0 = 𝑚𝜔 𝜋ℏ 1 2 𝑒−𝑚𝜔 ℏ 𝑥2 8 Higher order polynomials. Now let’s try 𝐻1 = 𝑎𝑦 + 𝑏 𝑑2𝐻1 𝑑𝑦2 − 2𝑦 𝑑𝐻1 𝑑𝑦 + 𝜖 − 1 𝐻1 = 0 𝑑𝐻1 𝑑𝑦 = 𝑎; 𝑑2𝐻1 𝑑𝑦2 = 0 −2𝑦𝑎 + 𝜖 − 1 (𝑎𝑦 + 𝑏) = 0 Each set of terms of a particular order in y must sum to zero: −2𝑎 + 𝜖𝑎 − 𝑎 = 0 so 𝜖1 = 3 and therefore 𝐸1 = 3 2 ℏ𝜔 9 We also know that 𝜖1 − 1 (+𝑏) = 0, which yields either 𝜖1 = 1 or 𝑏 = 0. We choose 𝑏 = 0 because setting a=0 just results in the lowest order polynomial again. Hence: 𝜓1 𝑦 = 𝑎1𝑦𝑒− 𝑦2 2 10 • Townsend shows a more general approach to solving the Hermite equation in which he assumes that:𝐻𝑛 𝑦 = σ𝑘=0 𝑛 𝑎𝑘𝑦𝑘 • And finds the following properties: 𝜖𝑛 = 2𝑛 + 1 so 𝐸𝑛 = 𝑛 + 1 2 ℏ𝜔 11 Hermite Polynomials 12 𝐻0 𝑦 = 1 (even) 𝐻1 𝑦 = 2𝑦 (odd) 𝐻2 𝑦 = 4𝑦2 − 2 (even) 𝐻3 𝑦 = 8𝑦3 − 12𝑦 (odd) Wavefunction solutions 13 𝜓0 𝑦 = 𝐴0𝑒−𝑦2 2 = 𝐴0 exp − 𝑚𝜔𝑥2 ℏ 𝜓1 𝑦 = 𝐴1 𝑚𝜔 ℏ 𝑥 exp − 𝑚𝜔𝑥2 ℏ 𝜓2 𝑦 = 𝐴2 4𝑦2 − 2 𝑒− 𝑦2 2 𝜓3(𝑦) = 𝐴3(8𝑦3 − 12𝑦)𝑒− 𝑦2 2 Probability density 14 Note that particles in a high energy state spend more time at the edges of the allowed region. Normalization The normalization requirement is: 1 = න −∞ ∞ 𝜓𝑛 ∗𝜓𝑛𝑑𝑥 = 𝐴0 2∫ 𝑒−𝑎𝑥2𝑑𝑥 The integral of a Gaussian function can be solved using a “cute” trick shown on p 126 of Townsend. We just give the result here: ∫ 𝑒−𝑎𝑥2𝑑𝑥 = 𝜋 𝑎 And so: 𝜓0 𝑥 = 𝑚𝜔 𝜋ℏ 1 4 𝑒−𝑚𝜔𝑥2 2ℏ 15 Normalization Other Gaussian integrals for normalization of Harmonic Oscillator eigenfunctions will all be of the form: න −∞ ∞ 𝑥2𝑛𝑒−𝑎𝑥2𝑑𝑥 These can be deduced using another trick: 𝜕 𝜕𝑎 න −∞ ∞ 𝑒−𝑎𝑥2𝑑𝑥 = 𝜕 𝜕𝑎 𝜋 𝑎 න −∞ ∞ −𝑥2𝑒−𝑎𝑥2𝑑𝑥 = 1 2𝑎 𝜋 𝑎 16 Other properties of Harmonic oscillator solutions • The solutions are even or odd. – 𝑥 = ∫ 𝜓∗𝑥𝜓𝑑𝑥 = 0 • The derivative of an even solution is odd and of an odd solution is even – 𝑝𝑥 = −𝑖ℏ ∫ 𝜓∗ 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 𝜓𝑑𝑥 = ∫ 𝑜𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑥 = 0 • The space solutions are real, therefore the probability current is zero. • Since the ground state is a Gaussian, it will have the minimum value for Δ𝑥Δ𝑝 ≥ ℏ 2 17","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
