Installing some software which we will be using over the next several class meetings. This is not computational physics. Less on the theory of numerical analysis Leans toward the practical Tools necessary to accomplish coursework and begin research What is this class about?Format ◦We meet in person. Lecture will take approx. half the time, followed by an activity. ◦The activities will focus on writing small programs to apply what is learned in lecture portion. The activities will be available on the LMS and your work will be submitted to the LMS by the end of class. ◦All lecture slides, activities, and HW assignments will be posted on LMS. ◦There will be frequent short homework assignments. They will typically be assigned the day after the previous one was due. ** first HW assignment is already posted ** ◦There will be 4 exams. They will be open notes/internet. Material covered (4hr course) Linux environment, command line (bash), basic scripting Jupyter-notebook and scientific Python libraries (e.g., numPy, sciPy, etc) Data handling, fitting, manipulation and visualization Root finding, numeric integration/derivative Writing programs to numerically integrate ODEs Random numbers, Stochastic processes Scientific paper editing (LaTeX) Generation of publication quality scientific figures Solving problems analytically using Mathematica Solving systems of linear equations using Matrix solvers. Quantum computing basics and Qiskit ..TBD the command line(bash shell) Python (Jupyter notebook) LaTeX Mathematica Gnuplot Qiskit tools Additional Resources useful texts. Selected chapters will be put on the LMS under additional resources. Grades In class exercises (20%) Homework (20%) Four (“in-class”) activity-based tests (60%) Grade modifiers will be used in this class. The range for each grade is given below. A=92 to 100 A-=89 to 92 B+=86 to 89 B=82 to 86 B-=79 to 82 C+=76 to 79 C=72 to 76 C- =67 to 72 D=55 to 67 Getting help My office hours: After class on Tues. 3:35-5:00 pm or anytime upon request/availability. email: damienwest@gmail.com(or westd2@rpi.edu) Class Discord server (https://discord.gg/cax9qFc6UC) My Webexhttps://rensselaer.webex.com/meet/westd2 Get a bash shell (Windows Users) Download MobaXterm ◦Gives a minimal linux like environment with bash shell. Mac users need not download. Terminal already provides a linux-like shell environment Alternately, you could use git-bash which is very light weight bash shell: https://git-scm.com/download/wins Install Ubuntu (available at Microsoft store) To use, you need to enable windows subsystem for linux.If you have some alternate linux environment, then this is not necessary. Make sure both are checked Install addition software in linux: numpy and gnuplot Enter following commands at shell: sudo apt update (updates list of software) sudo apt-get install python3 (installs python) sudo apt-get install python3-pip (installs pip) pip3 install numpy (uses pip to install numpy) sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11 (installs gnuplot)","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
