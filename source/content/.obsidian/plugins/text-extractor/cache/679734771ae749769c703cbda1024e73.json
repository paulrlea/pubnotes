an undergradu- ate course at the junior or senior level. It can be covered comfortably in two semesters, maybe even with room to spare for special topics (AC circuits, nu- merical methods, plasma physics, transmission lines, antenna theory, etc.) A one-semester course could reasonably stop after Chapter 7. Unlike quantum me- chanics or thermal physics (for example), there is a fairly general consensus with respect to the teaching of electrodynamics; the subjects to be included, and even their order of presentation, are not particularly controversial, and textbooks differ mainly in style and tone. My approach is perhaps less formal than most; I think this makes difﬁcult ideas more interesting and accessible. For this new edition I have made a large number of small changes, in the in- terests of clarity and grace. In a few places I have corrected serious errors. I have added some problems and examples (and removed a few that were not effective). And I have included more references to the accessible literature (particularly the American Journal of Physics). I realize, of course, that most readers will not have the time or inclination to consult these resources, but I think it is worthwhile anyway, if only to emphasize that electrodynamics, notwithstanding its venerable age, is very much alive, and intriguing new discoveries are being made all the time. I hope that occasionally a problem will pique your curiosity, and you will be inspired to look up the reference—some of them are real gems. I have maintained three items of unorthodox notation: • The Cartesian unit vectors are written ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz (and, in general, all unit vectors inherit the letter of the corresponding coordinate). • The distance from the z axis in cylindrical coordinates is designated by s,to avoid confusion with r (the distance from the origin, and the radial coordi- nate in spherical coordinates). • The script letter r denotes the vector from a source point r ˙ to the ﬁeld point r (see Figure). Some authors prefer the more explicit (r − r ˙). But this makes many equations distractingly cumbersome, especially when the unit vector ˆr is involved. I realize that unwary readers are tempted to interpret r as r—it certainly makes the integrals easier! Please take note: r ≡ (r − r ˙), which is not the same as r. I think it’s good notation, but it does have to be handled with care. 1 1In MS Word, r is “Kaufmann font,” but this is very difﬁcult to install in TeX. TeX users can download a pretty good facsimile from my web site.xii Preface xiii r x y dτ\u0002 z r r\u0002 Source point Field point As in previous editions, I distinguish two kinds of problems. Some have a speciﬁc pedagogical purpose, and should be worked immediately after reading the section to which they pertain; these I have placed at the pertinent point within the chapter. (In a few cases the solution to a problem is used later in the text; these are indicated by a bullet (•) in the left margin.) Longer problems, or those of a more general nature, will be found at the end of each chapter. When I teach the subject, I assign some of these, and work a few of them in class. Unusually challenging problems are ﬂagged by an exclamation point (!) in the margin. Many readers have asked that the answers to problems be provided at the back of the book; unfortunately, just as many are strenuously opposed. I have compromised, supplying answers when this seems particularly appropriate. A complete solution manual is available (to instructors) from the publisher; go to the Pearson web site to order a copy. I have beneﬁtted from the comments of many colleagues. I cannot list them all here, but I would like to thank the following people for especially useful con- tributions to this edition: Burton Brody (Bard), Catherine Crouch (Swarthmore), Joel Franklin (Reed), Ted Jacobson (Maryland), Don Koks (Adelaide), Charles Lane (Berry), Kirk McDonald 2 (Princeton), Jim McTavish (Liverpool), Rich Saenz (Cal Poly), Darrel Schroeter (Reed), Herschel Snodgrass (Lewis and Clark), and Larry Tankersley (Naval Academy). Practically everything I know about electrodynamics—certainly about teaching electrodynamics—I owe to Edward Purcell. David J. Grifﬁths 2Kirk’s web site, http://www.hep.princeton.edu/∼mcdonald/examples/, is a fantastic resource, with clever explanations, nifty problems, and useful references. Advertisement WHAT IS ELECTRODYNAMICS, AND HOW DOES IT FIT INTO THE GENERAL SCHEME OF PHYSICS? Four Realms of Mechanics In the diagram below, I have sketched out the four great realms of mechanics: Classical Mechanics Quantum Mechanics (Newton) (Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, et al.) Special Relativity Quantum Field Theory (Einstein) (Dirac, Pauli, Feynman, Schwinger, et al.) Newtonian mechanics is adequate for most purposes in “everyday life,” but for objects moving at high speeds (near the speed of light) it is incorrect, and must be replaced by special relativity (introduced by Einstein in 1905); for objects that are extremely small (near the size of atoms) it fails for different reasons, and is superseded by quantum mechanics (developed by Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and many others, in the 1920’s, mostly). For objects that are both very fast and very small (as is common in modern particle physics), a mechanics that com- bines relativity and quantum principles is in order; this relativistic quantum me- chanics is known as quantum ﬁeld theory—it was worked out in the thirties and forties, but even today it cannot claim to be a completely satisfactory system. In this book, save for the last chapter, we shall work exclusively in the domain of classical mechanics, although electrodynamics extends with unique simplic- ity to the other three realms. (In fact, the theory is in most respects automat- ically consistent with special relativity, for which it was, historically, the main stimulus.) Four Kinds of Forces Mechanics tells us how a system will behave when subjected to a given force. There are just four basic forces known (presently) to physics: I list them in the order of decreasing strength: xiv Advertisement xv 1. Strong 2. Electromagnetic 3. Weak 4. Gravitational The brevity of this list may surprise you. Where is friction? Where is the “normal” force that keeps you from falling through the ﬂoor? Where are the chemical forces that bind molecules together? Where is the force of impact between two colliding billiard balls? The answer is that all these forces are electromagnetic. Indeed, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that we live in an electromagnetic world— virtually every force we experience in everyday life, with the exception of gravity, is electromagnetic in origin. The strong forces, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nu- cleus, have extremely short range, so we do not “feel” them, in spite of the fact that they are a hundred times more powerful than electrical forces. The weak forces, which account for certain kinds of radioactive decay, are also of short range, and they are far weaker than electromagnetic forces. As for gravity, it is so pitifully feeble (compared to all of the others) that it is only by virtue of huge mass con- centrations (like the earth and the sun) that we ever notice it at all. The electrical repulsion between two electrons is 10 42 times as large as their gravitational at- traction, and if atoms were held together by gravitational (instead of electrical) forces, a single hydrogen atom would be much larger than the known universe. Not only are electromagnetic forces overwhelmingly dominant in everyday life, they are also, at present, the only ones that are completely understood. There is, of course, a classical theory of gravity (Newton’s law of universal gravitation) and a relativistic one (Einstein’s general relativity), but no entirely satisfactory quantum mechanical theory of gravity has been constructed (though many people are working on it). At the present time there is a very successful (if cumbersome) theory for the weak interactions, and a strikingly attractive candidate (called chro- modynamics) for the strong interactions. All these theories draw their inspiration from electrodynamics; none can claim conclusive experimental veriﬁcation at this stage. So electrodynamics, a beautifully complete and successful theory, has be- come a kind of paradigm for physicists: an ideal model that other theories emulate. The laws of classical electrodynamics were discovered in bits and pieces by Franklin, Coulomb, Ampère, Faraday, and others, but the person who completed the job, and packaged it all in the compact and consistent form it has today, was James Clerk Maxwell. The theory is now about 150 years old. The Uniﬁcation of Physical Theories In the beginning, electricity and magnetism were entirely separate subjects. The one dealt with glass rods and cat’s fur, pith balls, batteries, currents, electrolysis, and lightning; the other with bar magnets, iron ﬁlings, compass needles, and the North Pole. But in 1820 Oersted noticed that an electric current could deﬂect xvi Advertisement a magnetic compass needle. Soon afterward, Ampère correctly postulated that all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion. Then, in 1831, Faraday discovered that a moving magnet generates an electric current. By the time Maxwell and Lorentz put the ﬁnishing touches on the theory, electricity and magnetism were inextricably intertwined. They could no longer be regarded as separate subjects, but rather as two aspects of a single subject: electromagnetism. Faraday speculated that light, too, is electrical in nature. Maxwell’s theory pro- vided spectacular justiﬁcation for this hypothesis, and soon optics—the study of lenses, mirrors, prisms, interference, and diffraction—was incorporated into electromagnetism. Hertz, who presented the decisive experimental conﬁrmation for Maxwell’s theory in 1888, put it this way: “The connection between light and electricity is now established ... In every ﬂame, in every luminous parti- cle, we see an electrical process ... Thus, the domain of electricity extends over the whole of nature. It even affects ourselves intimately: we perceive that we possess ... an electrical organ—the eye.” By 1900, then, three great branches of physics–electricity, magnetism, and optics–had merged into a single uniﬁed the- ory. (And it was soon apparent that visible light represents only a tiny “window” in the vast spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, from radio through microwaves, infrared and ultraviolet, to x-rays and gamma rays.) Einstein dreamed of a further uniﬁcation, which would combine gravity and electrodynamics, in much the same way as electricity and magnetism had been combined a century earlier. His uniﬁed ﬁeld theory was not particularly success- ful, but in recent years the same impulse has spawned a hierarchy of increasingly ambitious (and speculative) uniﬁcation schemes, beginning in the 1960s with the electroweak theory of Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam (which joins the weak and electromagnetic forces), and culminating in the 1980s with the superstring the- ory (which, according to its proponents, incorporates all four forces in a single “theory of everything”). At each step in this hierarchy, the mathematical difﬁcul- ties mount, and the gap between inspired conjecture and experimental test widens; nevertheless, it is clear that the uniﬁcation of forces initiated by electrodynamics has become a major theme in the progress of physics. The Field Formulation of Electrodynamics The fundamental problem a theory of electromagnetism hopes to solve is this: I hold up a bunch of electric charges here (and maybe shake them around); what happens to some other charge, over there? The classical solution takes the form of a ﬁeld theory: We say that the space around an electric charge is permeated by electric and magnetic ﬁelds (the electromagnetic “odor,” as it were, of the charge). A second charge, in the presence of these ﬁelds, experiences a force; the ﬁelds, then, transmit the inﬂuence from one charge to the other—they “mediate” the interaction. When a charge undergoes acceleration, a portion of the ﬁeld “detaches” itself, in a sense, and travels off at the speed of light, carrying with it energy, momen- tum, and angular momentum. We call this electromagnetic radiation. Its exis- Advertisement xvii tence invites (if not compels) us to regard the ﬁelds as independent dynamical entities in their own right, every bit as “real” as atoms or baseballs. Our interest accordingly shifts from the study of forces between charges to the theory of the ﬁelds themselves. But it takes a charge to produce an electromagnetic ﬁeld, and it takes another charge to detect one, so we had best begin by reviewing the essential properties of electric charge. Electric Charge 1. Charge comes in two varieties, which we call “plus” and “minus,” because their effects tend to cancel (if you have +q and −q at the same point, electrically it is the same as having no charge there at all). This may seem too obvious to warrant comment, but I encourage you to contemplate other possibilities: what if there were 8 or 10 different species of charge? (In chromodynamics there are, in fact, three quantities analogous to electric charge, each of which may be positive or negative.) Or what if the two kinds did not tend to cancel? The extraordinary fact is that plus and minus charges occur in exactly equal amounts, to fantastic precision, in bulk matter, so that their effects are almost completely neutralized. Were it not for this, we would be subjected to enormous forces: a potato would explode violently if the cancellation were imperfect by as little as one part in 10 10. 2. Charge is conserved: it cannot be created or destroyed—what there is now has always been. (A plus charge can “annihilate” an equal minus charge, but a plus charge cannot simply disappear by itself—something must pick up that electric charge.) So the total charge of the universe is ﬁxed for all time. This is called global conservation of charge. Actually, I can say something much stronger: Global conservation would allow for a charge to disappear in New York and instantly reappear in San Francisco (that wouldn’t affect the total), and yet we know this doesn’t happen. If the charge was in New York and it went to San Fran- cisco, then it must have passed along some continuous path from one to the other. This is called local conservation of charge. Later on we’ll see how to formulate a precise mathematical law expressing local conservation of charge—it’s called the continuity equation. 3. Charge is quantized. Although nothing in classical electrodynamics requires that it be so, the fact is that electric charge comes only in discrete lumps—integer multiples of the basic unit of charge. If we call the charge on the proton +e, then the electron carries charge −e; the neutron charge zero; the pi mesons +e, 0, and −e; the carbon nucleus +6e; and so on (never 7.392e,oreven1/2e).3 This fundamental unit of charge is extremely small, so for practical purposes it is usually appropriate to ignore quantization altogether. Water, too, “really” con- sists of discrete lumps (molecules); yet, if we are dealing with reasonably large 3Actually, protons and neutrons are composed of three quarks, which carry fractional charges (± 2 3 e and ± 1 3 e). However, free quarks do not appear to exist in nature, and in any event, this does not alter the fact that charge is quantized; it merely reduces the size of the basic unit. xviii Advertisement quantities of it we can treat it as a continuous ﬂuid. This is in fact much closer to Maxwell’s own view; he knew nothing of electrons and protons—he must have pictured charge as a kind of “jelly” that could be divided up into portions of any size and smeared out at will. Units The subject of electrodynamics is plagued by competing systems of units, which sometimes render it difﬁcult for physicists to communicate with one another. The problem is far worse than in mechanics, where Neanderthals still speak of pounds and feet; in mechanics, at least all equations look the same, regardless of the units used to measure quantities. Newton’s second law remains F = ma, whether it is feet-pounds-seconds, kilograms-meters-seconds, or whatever. But this is not so in electromagnetism, where Coulomb’s law may appear variously as F = q1q2 r2 ˆr (Gaussian), or F = 1 4πϵ0 q1q2 r2 ˆr (SI), or F = 1 4π q1q2 r2 ˆr (HL). Of the systems in common use, the two most popular are Gaussian (cgs) and SI (mks). Elementary particle theorists favor yet a third system: Heaviside-Lorentz. Although Gaussian units offer distinct theoretical advantages, most undergradu- ate instructors seem to prefer SI, I suppose because they incorporate the familiar household units (volts, amperes, and watts). In this book, therefore, I have used SI units. Appendix C provides a “dictionary” for converting the main results into Gaussian units. CHAPTER 1 Vector Analysis 1.1 VECTOR ALGEBRA 1.1.1 Vector Operations If you walk 4 miles due north and then 3 miles due east (Fig. 1.1), you will have gone a total of 7 miles, but you’re not 7 miles from where you set out—you’re only 5. We need an arithmetic to describe quantities like this, which evidently do not add in the ordinary way. The reason they don’t, of course, is that displace- ments (straight line segments going from one point to another) have direction as well as magnitude (length), and it is essential to take both into account when you combine them. Such objects are called vectors: velocity, acceleration, force and momentum are other examples. By contrast, quantities that have magnitude but no direction are called scalars: examples include mass, charge, density, and temperature. I shall use boldface (A, B, and so on) for vectors and ordinary type for scalars. The magnitude of a vector A is written |A| or, more simply, A. In diagrams, vec- tors are denoted by arrows: the length of the arrow is proportional to the magni- tude of the vector, and the arrowhead indicates its direction. Minus A (−A)isa vector with the same magnitude as A but of opposite direction (Fig. 1.2). Note that vectors have magnitude and direction but not location: a displacement of 4 miles due north from Washington is represented by the same vector as a displacement 4 miles north from Baltimore (neglecting, of course, the curvature of the earth). On a diagram, therefore, you can slide the arrow around at will, as long as you don’t change its length or direction. We deﬁne four vector operations: addition and three kinds of multiplication. 3 mi 5 mi 4 mi FIGURE 1.1 −AA FIGURE 1.2 1 2 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis A A B B (A+B) (B+A) FIGURE 1.3 −B A(A−B) FIGURE 1.4 (i) Addition of two vectors. Place the tail of B at the head of A;the sum, A + B, is the vector from the tail of A to the head of B (Fig. 1.3). (This rule generalizes the obvious procedure for combining two displacements.) Addition is commutative: A + B = B + A; 3 miles east followed by 4 miles north gets you to the same place as 4 miles north followed by 3 miles east. Addition is also associative: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). To subtract a vector, add its opposite (Fig. 1.4): A − B = A + (−B). (ii) Multiplication by a scalar. Multiplication of a vector by a positive scalar a multiplies the magnitude but leaves the direction unchanged (Fig. 1.5). (If a is negative, the direction is reversed.) Scalar multiplication is distributive: a(A + B) = aA + aB. (iii) Dot product of two vectors. The dot product of two vectors is deﬁned by A · B ≡ AB cos θ, (1.1) where θ is the angle they form when placed tail-to-tail (Fig. 1.6). Note that A · B is itself a scalar (hence the alternative name scalar product). The dot product is commutative, A · B = B · A, and distributive, A · (B + C) = A · B + A · C. (1.2) Geometrically, A · B is the product of A times the projection of B along A (or the product of B times the projection of A along B). If the two vectors are parallel, then A · B = AB. In particular, for any vector A, A · A = A2. (1.3) If A and B are perpendicular, then A · B = 0. 1.1 Vector Algebra 3 A 2A FIGURE 1.5 B A θ FIGURE 1.6 Example 1.1. Let C = A − B (Fig. 1.7), and calculate the dot product of C with itself. Solution C · C = (A − B) · (A − B) = A · A − A · B − B · A + B · B, or C 2 = A2 + B2 − 2AB cos θ. This is the law of cosines. (iv) Cross product of two vectors. The cross product of two vectors is de- ﬁned by A × B ≡ AB sin θ ˆn, (1.4) where ˆn is a unit vector (vector of magnitude 1) pointing perpendicular to the plane of A and B. (I shall use a hat ( ˆ ) to denote unit vectors.) Of course, there are two directions perpendicular to any plane: “in” and “out.” The ambiguity is resolved by the right-hand rule: let your ﬁngers point in the direction of the ﬁrst vector and curl around (via the smaller angle) toward the second; then your thumb indicates the direction of ˆn. (In Fig. 1.8, A × B points into the page; B × A points out of the page.) Note that A × B is itself a vector (hence the alternative name vector product). The cross product is distributive, A × (B + C) = (A × B) + (A × C), (1.5) but not commutative. In fact, (B × A) =−(A × B). (1.6) 4 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis B CA θ FIGURE 1.7 B A θ FIGURE 1.8 Geometrically, |A × B| is the area of the parallelogram generated by A and B (Fig. 1.8). If two vectors are parallel, their cross product is zero. In particular, A × A = 0 for any vector A.(Here 0 is the zero vector, with magnitude 0.) Problem 1.1 Using the deﬁnitions in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.4, and appropriate diagrams, show that the dot product and cross product are distributive, a) when the three vectors are coplanar; b) in the general case.! Problem 1.2 Is the cross product associative? (A × B) × C ? = A × (B × C). If so, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample (the simpler the better). 1.1.2 Vector Algebra: Component Form In the previous section, I deﬁned the four vector operations (addition, scalar mul- tiplication, dot product, and cross product) in “abstract” form—that is, without reference to any particular coordinate system. In practice, it is often easier to set up Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and work with vector components.Let ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz be unit vectors parallel to the x, y, and z axes, respectively (Fig. 1.9(a)). An arbitrary vector A can be expanded in terms of these basis vectors (Fig. 1.9(b)): (a)x x z y y z (b)x Ax x Ayy Azz y z A FIGURE 1.9 1.1 Vector Algebra 5 A = Ax ˆx + Ay ˆy + Az ˆz. The numbers Ax , Ay, and Az, are the “components” of A; geometrically, they are the projections of A along the three coordinate axes (Ax = A · ˆx, Ay = A · ˆy, Az = A · ˆz). We can now reformulate each of the four vector operations as a rule for manipulating components: A + B = (Ax ˆx + Ay ˆy + Az ˆz) + (Bx ˆx + By ˆy + Bz ˆz) = (Ax + Bx )ˆx + (Ay + By)ˆy + (Az + Bz)ˆz. (1.7) Rule (i): To add vectors, add like components. aA = (aAx )ˆx + (aAy)ˆy + (aAz)ˆz. (1.8) Rule (ii): To multiply by a scalar, multiply each component. Because ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, ˆx · ˆx = ˆy · ˆy = ˆz · ˆz = 1; ˆx · ˆy = ˆx · ˆz = ˆy · ˆz = 0. (1.9) Accordingly, A · B = (Ax ˆx + Ay ˆy + Az ˆz) · (Bx ˆx + By ˆy + Bz ˆz) = Ax Bx + Ay By + Az Bz. (1.10) Rule (iii): To calculate the dot product, multiply like components, and add. In particular, A · A = A2 x + A2 y + A2 z , so A = √A2 x + A2 y + A2 z . (1.11) (This is, if you like, the three-dimensional generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.) Similarly,1 ˆx × ˆx = ˆy × ˆy = ˆz × ˆz = 0, ˆx × ˆy =−ˆy × ˆx = ˆz, ˆy × ˆz =−ˆz × ˆy = ˆx, ˆz × ˆx =−ˆx × ˆz = ˆy. (1.12) 1These signs pertain to a right-handed coordinate system (x-axis out of the page, y-axis to the right, z-axis up, or any rotated version thereof). In a left-handed system (z-axis down), the signs would be reversed: ˆx × ˆy =−ˆz, and so on. We shall use right-handed systems exclusively. 6 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Therefore, A × B = (Ax ˆx + Ay ˆy + Az ˆz) × (Bx ˆx + By ˆy + Bz ˆz) (1.13) = (Ay Bz − Az By)ˆx + (Az Bx − Ax Bz)ˆy + (Ax By − Ay Bx )ˆz. This cumbersome expression can be written more neatly as a determinant: A × B = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ˆx ˆy ˆz Ax Ay Az Bx By Bz ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ . (1.14) Rule (iv): To calculate the cross product, form the determinant whose ﬁrst row is ˆx, ˆy, ˆz, whose second row is A (in component form), and whose third row is B. Example 1.2. Find the angle between the face diagonals of a cube. Solution We might as well use a cube of side 1, and place it as shown in Fig. 1.10, with one corner at the origin. The face diagonals A and B are A = 1 ˆx + 0 ˆy + 1 ˆz; B = 0 ˆx + 1 ˆy + 1 ˆz. z θ A B (0, 0, 1) y (0, 1, 0) x (1, 0, 0) FIGURE 1.10 So, in component form, A · B = 1 · 0 + 0 · 1 + 1 · 1 = 1. On the other hand, in “abstract” form, A · B = AB cos θ = √ 2√ 2 cos θ = 2 cos θ. Therefore, cos θ = 1/2, or θ = 60 ◦. Of course, you can get the answer more easily by drawing in a diagonal across the top of the cube, completing the equilateral triangle. But in cases where the geometry is not so simple, this device of comparing the abstract and component forms of the dot product can be a very efﬁcient means of ﬁnding angles. 1.1 Vector Algebra 7 Problem 1.3 Find the angle between the body diagonals of a cube. Problem 1.4 Use the cross product to ﬁnd the components of the unit vector ˆn perpendicular to the shaded plane in Fig. 1.11. 1.1.3 Triple Products Since the cross product of two vectors is itself a vector, it can be dotted or crossed with a third vector to form a triple product. (i) Scalar triple product: A · (B × C). Geometrically, |A · (B × C)| is the volume of the parallelepiped generated by A, B, and C, since |B × C| is the area of the base, and |A cos θ | is the altitude (Fig. 1.12). Evidently, A · (B × C) = B · (C × A) = C · (A × B), (1.15) for they all correspond to the same ﬁgure. Note that “alphabetical” order is preserved—in view of Eq. 1.6, the “nonalphabetical” triple products, A · (C × B) = B · (A × C) = C · (B × A), have the opposite sign. In component form, A · (B × C) = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ Ax Ay Az Bx By Bz Cx C y Cz ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ . (1.16) Note that the dot and cross can be interchanged: A · (B × C) = (A × B) · C (this follows immediately from Eq. 1.15); however, the placement of the parenthe- sesiscritical: (A · B) × C is a meaningless expression—you can’t make a cross product from a scalar and a vector. x y z n 1 2 3 FIGURE 1.11 B C A θ n FIGURE 1.12 8 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis (ii) Vector triple product: A × (B × C). The vector triple product can be simpliﬁed by the so-called BAC-CAB rule: A × (B × C) = B(A · C) − C(A · B). (1.17) Notice that (A × B) × C =−C × (A × B) =−A(B · C) + B(A · C) is an entirely different vector (cross-products are not associative). All higher vec- tor products can be similarly reduced, often by repeated application of Eq. 1.17, so it is never necessary for an expression to contain more than one cross product in any term. For instance, (A × B) · (C × D) = (A · C)(B · D) − (A · D)(B · C); A ×[B × (C × D)]= B[A · (C × D)]− (A · B)(C × D). (1.18) Problem 1.5 Prove the BAC-CAB rule by writing out both sides in component form. Problem 1.6 Prove that [A × (B × C)]+[B × (C × A)]+[C × (A × B)]= 0. Under what conditions does A × (B × C) = (A × B) × C? 1.1.4 Position, Displacement, and Separation Vectors The location of a point in three dimensions can be described by listing its Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). The vector to that point from the origin (O) is called the position vector (Fig. 1.13): r ≡ x ˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz. (1.19) r y z z yx x (x, y, z) r O FIGURE 1.13 r r r\u0002 Source point Field point O FIGURE 1.14 1.1 Vector Algebra 9 I will reserve the letter r for this purpose, throughout the book. Its magnitude, r = √x 2 + y2 + z2, (1.20) is the distance from the origin, and ˆr = r r = x ˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz √x 2 + y2 + z2 (1.21) is a unit vector pointing radially outward. The inﬁnitesimal displacement vector, from (x, y, z) to (x + dx, y + dy, z + dz),is dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz. (1.22) (We could call this dr, since that’s what it is, but it is useful to have a special notation for inﬁnitesimal displacements.) In electrodynamics, one frequently encounters problems involving two points—typically, a source point, r [, where an electric charge is located, and a ﬁeld point, r, at which you are calculating the electric or magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 1.14). It pays to adopt right from the start some short-hand notation for the separation vector from the source point to the ﬁeld point. I shall use for this purpose the script letter r: r ≡ r − r [. (1.23) Its magnitude is r =|r − r [|, (1.24) and a unit vector in the direction from r [ to r is ˆr = r r = r − r [ |r − r[| . (1.25) In Cartesian coordinates, r = (x − x [)ˆx + (y − y[)ˆy + (z − z[)ˆz, (1.26) r = √(x − x [)2 + (y − y[)2 + (z − z[)2, (1.27) ˆr = (x − x [)ˆx + (y − y[)ˆy + (z − z[)ˆz √(x − x [)2 + (y − y[)2 + (z − z[)2 (1.28) (from which you can appreciate the economy of the script-r notation). Problem 1.7 Find the separation vector r from the source point (2,8,7) to the ﬁeld point (4,6,8). Determine its magnitude (r), and construct the unit vector ˆr. 10 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis 1.1.5 How Vectors Transform 2 The deﬁnition of a vector as “a quantity with a magnitude and direction” is not altogether satisfactory: What precisely does “direction” mean? This may seem a pedantic question, but we shall soon encounter a species of derivative that looks rather like a vector, and we’ll want to know for sure whether it is one. You might be inclined to say that a vector is anything that has three components that combine properly under addition. Well, how about this: We have a barrel of fruit that contains Nx pears, Ny apples, and Nz bananas. Is N = Nx ˆx + Ny ˆy + Nz ˆz a vector? It has three components, and when you add another barrel with Mx pears, My apples, and Mz bananas the result is (Nx + Mx ) pears, (Ny + My) apples, (Nz + Mz) bananas. So it does add like a vector. Yet it’s obviously not a vector, in the physicist’s sense of the word, because it doesn’t really have a direction. What exactly is wrong with it? The answer is that N does not transform properly when you change coordi- nates. The coordinate frame we use to describe positions in space is of course entirely arbitrary, but there is a speciﬁc geometrical transformation law for con- verting vector components from one frame to another. Suppose, for instance, the x, y, z system is rotated by angle φ, relative to x, y, z, about the common x = x axes. From Fig. 1.15, Ay = A cos θ, Az = A sin θ, while Ay = A cos θ = A cos(θ − φ) = A(cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ) = cos φ Ay + sin φ Az, Az = A sin θ = A sin(θ − φ) = A(sin θ cos φ − cos θ sin φ) =− sin φ Ay + cos φ Az. y z θ φ A y z θ FIGURE 1.15 2This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. 1.1 Vector Algebra 11 We might express this conclusion in matrix notation: ( Ay Az ) = ( cos φ sin φ − sin φ cos φ )( Ay Az ) . (1.29) More generally, for rotation about an arbitrary axis in three dimensions, the transformation law takes the form ⎛ ⎝ Ax Ay Az ⎞ ⎠ = ⎛ ⎝ Rxx Rxy Rxz Ryx Ryy Ryz Rzx Rzy Rzz ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ Ax Ay Az ⎞ ⎠ , (1.30) or, more compactly, Ai = 3∑ j=1 Rij A j , (1.31) where the index 1 stands for x,2for y, and 3 for z. The elements of the ma- trix R can be ascertained, for a given rotation, by the same sort of trigonometric arguments as we used for a rotation about the x axis. Now: Do the components of N transform in this way? Of course not—it doesn’t matter what coordinates you use to represent positions in space; there are still just as many apples in the barrel. You can’t convert a pear into a banana by choosing a different set of axes, but you can turn Ax into Ay. Formally, then, a vector is any set of three components that transforms in the same manner as a displace- ment when you change coordinates. As always, displacement is the model for the behavior of all vectors.3 By the way, a (second-rank) tensor is a quantity with nine components, Txx , Txy, Txz, Tyx , ..., Tzz, which transform with two factors of R: T xx = Rxx (Rxx Txx + Rxy Txy + Rxz Txz) + Rxy(Rxx Tyx + Rxy Tyy + Rxz Tyz) + Rxz(Rxx Tzx + Rxy Tzy + Rxz Tzz),... or, more compactly, T ij = 3∑ k=1 3∑ l=1 Rik R jl Tkl. (1.32) 3If you’re a mathematician you might want to contemplate generalized vector spaces in which the “axes” have nothing to do with direction and the basis vectors are no longer ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz (indeed, there may be more than three dimensions). This is the subject of linear algebra. But for our purposes all vectors live in ordinary 3-space (or, in Chapter 12, in 4-dimensional space-time.) 12 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis In general, an nth-rank tensor has n indices and 3 n components, and transforms with n factors of R. In this hierarchy, a vector is a tensor of rank 1, and a scalar is a tensor of rank zero.4 Problem 1.8 (a) Prove that the two-dimensional rotation matrix (Eq. 1.29) preserves dot prod- ucts. (That is, show that Ay B y + Az B z = Ay By + Az Bz.) (b) What constraints must the elements (Rij ) of the three-dimensional rotation ma- trix (Eq. 1.30) satisfy, in order to preserve the length of A (for all vectors A)? Problem 1.9 Find the transformation matrix R that describes a rotation by 120◦ about an axis from the origin through the point (1, 1, 1). The rotation is clockwise as you look down the axis toward the origin. Problem 1.10 (a) How do the components of a vector 5 transform under a translation of coordi- nates (x = x, y = y − a, z = z, Fig. 1.16a)? (b) How do the components of a vector transform under an inversion of coordinates (x =−x, y =−y, z =−z, Fig. 1.16b)? (c) How do the components of a cross product (Eq. 1.13) transform under inver- sion? [The cross-product of two vectors is properly called a pseudovector be- cause of this “anomalous” behavior.] Is the cross product of two pseudovectors a vector, or a pseudovector? Name two pseudovector quantities in classical me- chanics. (d) How does the scalar triple product of three vectors transform under inversions? (Such an object is called a pseudoscalar.) y z x x z (a) ya} z (b) y x x z y FIGURE 1.16 4A scalar does not change when you change coordinates. In particular, the components of a vector are not scalars, but the magnitude is. 5Beware: The vector r (Eq. 1.19) goes from a speciﬁc point in space (the origin, O) to the point P = (x, y, z). Under translations the new origin ( ¯O) is at a different location, and the arrow from ¯O to P is a completely different vector. The original vector r still goes from O to P, regardless of the coordinates used to label these points. 1.2 Differential Calculus 13 1.2 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 1.2.1 “Ordinary” Derivatives Suppose we have a function of one variable: f (x). Question: What does the derivative, df /dx, do for us? Answer: It tells us how rapidly the function f (x) varies when we change the argument x by a tiny amount, dx: df = ( df dx ) dx. (1.33) In words: If we increment x by an inﬁnitesimal amount dx, then f changes by an amount df ; the derivative is the proportionality factor. For example, in Fig. 1.17(a), the function varies slowly with x, and the derivative is correspond- ingly small. In Fig. 1.17(b), f increases rapidly with x, and the derivative is large, as you move away from x = 0. Geometrical Interpretation: The derivative df /dx is the slope of the graph of f versus x. 1.2.2 Gradient Suppose, now, that we have a function of three variables—say, the temperature T (x, y, z) in this room. (Start out in one corner, and set up a system of axes; then for each point (x, y, z) in the room, T gives the temperature at that spot.) We want to generalize the notion of “derivative” to functions like T , which depend not on one but on three variables. A derivative is supposed to tell us how fast the function varies, if we move a little distance. But this time the situation is more complicated, because it depends on what direction we move: If we go straight up, then the temperature will prob- ably increase fairly rapidly, but if we move horizontally, it may not change much at all. In fact, the question “How fast does T vary?” has an inﬁnite number of answers, one for each direction we might choose to explore. Fortunately, the problem is not as bad as it looks. A theorem on partial deriva- tives states that dT = ( ∂ T ∂ x ) dx + ( ∂ T ∂ y ) dy + ( ∂ T ∂z ) dz. (1.34) x f (a) x f (b) FIGURE 1.17 14 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis This tells us how T changes when we alter all three variables by the inﬁnites- imal amounts dx, dy, dz. Notice that we do not require an inﬁnite number of derivatives—three will sufﬁce: the partial derivatives along each of the three co- ordinate directions. Equation 1.34 is reminiscent of a dot product: dT = ( ∂ T ∂ x ˆx + ∂ T ∂ y ˆy + ∂ T ∂z ˆz ) · (dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz) = (∇T ) · (dl), (1.35) where ∇T ≡ ∂ T ∂ x ˆx + ∂ T ∂ y ˆy + ∂ T ∂z ˆz (1.36) is the gradient of T . Note that ∇T is a vector quantity, with three components; it is the generalized derivative we have been looking for. Equation 1.35 is the three-dimensional version of Eq. 1.33. Geometrical Interpretation of the Gradient: Like any vector, the gradient has magnitude and direction. To determine its geometrical meaning, let’s rewrite the dot product (Eq. 1.35) using Eq. 1.1: dT = ∇T · dl =|∇T ||dl| cos θ, (1.37) where θ is the angle between ∇T and dl.Now,ifwe ﬁx the magnitude |dl| and search around in various directions (that is, vary θ ), the maximum change in T evidentally occurs when θ = 0 (for then cos θ = 1). That is, for a ﬁxed distance |dl|, dT is greatest when I move in the same direction as ∇T . Thus: The gradient ∇T points in the direction of maximum increase of the function T . Moreover: The magnitude |∇T | gives the slope (rate of increase) along this maximal direction. Imagine you are standing on a hillside. Look all around you, and ﬁnd the di- rection of steepest ascent. That is the direction of the gradient. Now measure the slope in that direction (rise over run). That is the magnitude of the gradient. (Here the function we’re talking about is the height of the hill, and the coordinates it depends on are positions—latitude and longitude, say. This function depends on only two variables, not three, but the geometrical meaning of the gradient is easier to grasp in two dimensions.) Notice from Eq. 1.37 that the direction of maximum descent is opposite to the direction of maximum ascent, while at right angles (θ = 90 ◦) the slope is zero (the gradient is perpendicular to the contour lines). You can conceive of surfaces that do not have these properties, but they always have “kinks” in them, and correspond to nondifferentiable functions. What would it mean for the gradient to vanish? If ∇T = 0 at (x, y, z), then dT = 0 for small displacements about the point (x, y, z). This is, then, a stationary point of the function T (x, y, z). It could be a maximum (a summit), 1.2 Differential Calculus 15 a minimum (a valley), a saddle point (a pass), or a “shoulder.” This is analogous to the situation for functions of one variable, where a vanishing derivative signals a maximum, a minimum, or an inﬂection. In particular, if you want to locate the extrema of a function of three variables, set its gradient equal to zero. Example 1.3. Find the gradient of r = √x 2 + y2 + z2 (the magnitude of the position vector). Solution ∇r = ∂r ∂ x ˆx + ∂r ∂ y ˆy + ∂r ∂z ˆz = 1 2 2x √x 2 + y2 + z2 ˆx + 1 2 2y √x 2 + y2 + z2 ˆy + 1 2 2z √x 2 + y2 + z2 ˆz = x ˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz √x 2 + y2 + z2 = r r = ˆr. Does this make sense? Well, it says that the distance from the origin increases most rapidly in the radial direction, and that its rate of increase in that direction is 1...just what you’d expect. Problem 1.11 Find the gradients of the following functions: (a) f (x, y, z) = x 2 + y3 + z4. (b) f (x, y, z) = x 2 y3z4. (c) f (x, y, z) = ex sin(y) ln(z). Problem 1.12 The height of a certain hill (in feet) is given by h(x, y) = 10(2xy − 3x 2 − 4y2 − 18x + 28y + 12), where y is the distance (in miles) north, x the distance east of South Hadley. (a) Where is the top of the hill located? (b) How high is the hill? (c) How steep is the slope (in feet per mile) at a point 1 mile north and one mile east of South Hadley? In what direction is the slope steepest, at that point? Problem 1.13 Let r be the separation vector from a ﬁxed point (x [, y[, z[) to the• point (x, y, z), and let r be its length. Show that (a) ∇(r 2) = 2r. (b) ∇(1/r) =−ˆr/r2. (c) What is the general formula for ∇(r n)? 16 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Problem 1.14 Suppose that f is a function of two variables (y and z) only.! Show that the gradient ∇ f = (∂ f /∂ y)ˆy + (∂ f /∂z)ˆz transforms as a vector un- der rotations, Eq. 1.29. [Hint: (∂ f /∂ y) = (∂ f /∂ y)(∂ y/∂ y) + (∂ f /∂z)(∂z/∂ y), and the analogous formula for ∂ f /∂z. We know that y = y cos φ + z sin φ and z =−y sin φ + z cos φ; “solve” these equations for y and z (as functions of y and z), and compute the needed derivatives ∂ y/∂ y,∂z/∂ y,etc.] 1.2.3 The Del Operator The gradient has the formal appearance of a vector, ∇, “multiplying” a scalar T : ∇T = (ˆx ∂ ∂ x + ˆy ∂ ∂ y + ˆz ∂ ∂z ) T. (1.38) (For once, I write the unit vectors to the left, just so no one will think this means ∂ ˆx/∂ x, and so on—which would be zero, since ˆx is constant.) The term in paren- theses is called del: ∇ = ˆx ∂ ∂ x + ˆy ∂ ∂ y + ˆz ∂ ∂z . (1.39) Of course, del is not a vector, in the usual sense. Indeed, it doesn’t mean much until we provide it with a function to act upon. Furthermore, it does not “multiply” T ; rather, it is an instruction to differentiate what follows. To be precise, then, we say that ∇ is a vector operator that acts upon T , not a vector that multiplies T . With this qualiﬁcation, though, ∇ mimics the behavior of an ordinary vector in virtually every way; almost anything that can be done with other vectors can also be done with ∇, if we merely translate “multiply” by “act upon.” So by all means take the vector appearance of ∇ seriously: it is a marvelous piece of notational simpliﬁcation, as you will appreciate if you ever consult Maxwell’s original work on electromagnetism, written without the beneﬁt of ∇. Now, an ordinary vector A can multiply in three ways: 1. By a scalar a : Aa; 2. By a vector B, via the dot product: A · B; 3. By a vector B via the cross product: A × B. Correspondingly, there are three ways the operator ∇ can act: 1. On a scalar function T : ∇T (the gradient); 2. On a vector function v, via the dot product: ∇ · v (the divergence); 3. On a vector function v, via the cross product: ∇ × v (the curl). 1.2 Differential Calculus 17 We have already discussed the gradient. In the following sections we examine the other two vector derivatives: divergence and curl. 1.2.4 The Divergence From the deﬁnition of ∇ we construct the divergence: ∇ · v = (ˆx ∂ ∂ x + ˆy ∂ ∂ y + ˆz ∂ ∂z ) · (vx ˆx + vy ˆy + vz ˆz) = ∂vx ∂ x + ∂vy ∂ y + ∂vz ∂z . (1.40) Observe that the divergence of a vector function 6 v is itself a scalar ∇ · v. Geometrical Interpretation: The name divergence is well chosen, for ∇ · v is a measure of how much the vector v spreads out (diverges) from the point in question. For example, the vector function in Fig. 1.18a has a large (positive) divergence (if the arrows pointed in, it would be a negative divergence), the func- tion in Fig. 1.18b has zero divergence, and the function in Fig. 1.18c again has a positive divergence. (Please understand that v here is a function—there’s a differ- ent vector associated with every point in space. In the diagrams, of course, I can only draw the arrows at a few representative locations.) Imagine standing at the edge of a pond. Sprinkle some sawdust or pine needles on the surface. If the material spreads out, then you dropped it at a point of positive divergence; if it collects together, you dropped it at a point of negative divergence. (The vector function v in this model is the velocity of the water at the surface— this is a two-dimensional example, but it helps give one a “feel” for what the divergence means. A point of positive divergence is a source, or “faucet”; a point of negative divergence is a sink, or “drain.”) (b)(a) (c) FIGURE 1.18 6A vector function v(x, y, z) = vx (x, y, z) ˆx + vy (x, y, z) ˆy + vz(x, y, z) ˆz is really three functions— one for each component. There’s no such thing as the divergence of a scalar. 18 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Example 1.4. Suppose the functions in Fig. 1.18 are va = r = x ˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz, vb = ˆz, and vc = z ˆz. Calculate their divergences. Solution ∇ · va = ∂ ∂ x (x) + ∂ ∂ y (y) + ∂ ∂z (z) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. As anticipated, this function has a positive divergence. ∇ · vb = ∂ ∂ x (0) + ∂ ∂ y (0) + ∂ ∂z (1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, as expected. ∇ · vc = ∂ ∂ x (0) + ∂ ∂ y (0) + ∂ ∂z (z) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. Problem 1.15 Calculate the divergence of the following vector functions: (a) va = x 2 ˆx + 3xz2 ˆy − 2xz ˆz. (b) vb = xy ˆx + 2yz ˆy + 3zx ˆz. (c) vc = y2 ˆx + (2xy + z2) ˆy + 2yz ˆz. Problem 1.16 Sketch the vector function• v = ˆr r 2 , and compute its divergence. The answer may surprise you. . . can you explain it? Problem 1.17 In two dimensions, show that the divergence transforms as a scalar! under rotations. [Hint: Use Eq. 1.29 to determine v y and vz, and the method of Prob. 1.14 to calculate the derivatives. Your aim is to show that ∂v y/∂ y + ∂vz/∂z = ∂vy/∂ y + ∂vz/∂z.] 1.2.5 The Curl From the deﬁnition of ∇ we construct the curl: ∇ × v = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ˆx ˆy ˆz ∂/∂ x ∂/∂ y ∂/∂z vx vy vz ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ˆx ( ∂vz ∂ y − ∂vy ∂z ) + ˆy ( ∂vx ∂z − ∂vz ∂ x ) + ˆz ( ∂vy ∂ x − ∂vx ∂ y ) . (1.41) 1.2 Differential Calculus 19 z x (a) y x (b) y z FIGURE 1.19 Notice that the curl of a vector function7 v is, like any cross product, a vector. Geometrical Interpretation: The name curl is also well chosen, for ∇ × v is a measure of how much the vector v swirls around the point in question. Thus the three functions in Fig. 1.18 all have zero curl (as you can easily check for yourself), whereas the functions in Fig. 1.19 have a substantial curl, pointing in the z direction, as the natural right-hand rule would suggest. Imagine (again) you are standing at the edge of a pond. Float a small paddlewheel (a cork with toothpicks pointing out radially would do); if it starts to rotate, then you placed it at a point of nonzero curl. A whirlpool would be a region of large curl. Example 1.5. Suppose the function sketched in Fig. 1.19a is va =−y ˆx + x ˆy, and that in Fig. 1.19b is vb = x ˆy. Calculate their curls. Solution ∇ × va = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ˆx ˆy ˆz ∂/∂ x ∂/∂ y ∂/∂z −yx 0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = 2ˆz, and ∇ × vb = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ˆx ˆy ˆz ∂/∂ x ∂/∂ y ∂/∂z 0 x 0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ˆz. As expected, these curls point in the +z direction. (Incidentally, they both have zero divergence, as you might guess from the pictures: nothing is “spreading out”...it just “swirls around.”) 7There’s no such thing as the curl of a scalar. 20 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Problem 1.18 Calculate the curls of the vector functions in Prob. 1.15. Problem 1.19 Drawacircleinthe xy plane. At a few representative points draw the vector v tangent to the circle, pointing in the clockwise direction. By comparing adjacent vectors, determine the sign of ∂vx /∂ y and ∂vy/∂ x. According to Eq. 1.41, then, what is the direction of ∇× v? Explain how this example illustrates the geo- metrical interpretation of the curl. Problem 1.20 Construct a vector function that has zero divergence and zero curl everywhere. (A constant will do the job, of course, but make it something a little more interesting than that!) 1.2.6 Product Rules The calculation of ordinary derivatives is facilitated by a number of rules, such as the sum rule: d dx ( f + g) = df dx + dg dx , the rule for multiplying by a constant: d dx (kf ) = k df dx , the product rule: d dx ( fg) = f dg dx + g df dx , and the quotient rule: d dx ( f g ) = g df dx − f dg dx g2 . Similar relations hold for the vector derivatives. Thus, ∇( f + g) = ∇ f + ∇g, ∇ · (A + B) = (∇ · A) + (∇ · B), ∇ × (A + B) = (∇ × A) + (∇ × B), and ∇(kf ) = k∇ f, ∇ · (kA) = k(∇ · A), ∇ × (kA) = k(∇ × A), as you can check for yourself. The product rules are not quite so simple. There are two ways to construct a scalar as the product of two functions: fg (product of two scalar functions), A · B (dot product of two vector functions), 1.2 Differential Calculus 21 and two ways to make a vector: f A (scalar times vector), A × B (cross product of two vectors). Accordingly, there are six product rules, two for gradients: (i) ∇( fg) = f ∇g + g∇ f, (ii) ∇(A · B) = A × (∇ × B) + B × (∇ × A) + (A · ∇)B + (B · ∇)A, two for divergences: (iii) ∇ · ( f A) = f (∇ · A) + A · (∇ f ), (iv) ∇ · (A × B) = B · (∇ × A) − A · (∇ × B), and two for curls: (v) ∇ × ( f A) = f (∇ × A) − A × (∇ f ), (vi) ∇ × (A × B) = (B · ∇)A − (A · ∇)B + A(∇ · B) − B(∇ · A). You will be using these product rules so frequently that I have put them inside the front cover for easy reference. The proofs come straight from the product rule for ordinary derivatives. For instance, ∇ · ( f A) = ∂ ∂ x ( fAx ) + ∂ ∂ y ( fAy) + ∂ ∂z ( fAz) = ( ∂ f ∂ x Ax + f ∂ Ax ∂ x ) + ( ∂ f ∂ y Ay + f ∂ Ay ∂ y ) + ( ∂ f ∂z Az + f ∂ Az ∂z ) = (∇ f ) · A + f (∇ · A). It is also possible to formulate three quotient rules: ∇ ( f g ) = g∇ f − f ∇g g2 , ∇ · ( A g ) = g(∇ · A) − A · (∇g) g2 , ∇ × ( A g ) = g(∇ × A) + A × (∇g) g2 . However, since these can be obtained quickly from the corresponding product rules, there is no point in listing them separately. 22 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Problem 1.21 Prove product rules (i), (iv), and (v). Problem 1.22 (a) If A and B are two vector functions, what does the expression (A · ∇)B mean? (That is, what are its x, y,and z components, in terms of the Cartesian compo- nents of A, B,and ∇?) (b) Compute (ˆr · ∇)ˆr,where ˆr is the unit vector deﬁned in Eq. 1.21. (c) For the functions in Prob. 1.15, evaluate (va · ∇)vb. Problem 1.23 (For masochists only.) Prove product rules (ii) and (vi). Refer to Prob. 1.22 for the deﬁnition of (A · ∇)B. Problem 1.24 Derive the three quotient rules. Problem 1.25 (a) Check product rule (iv) (by calculating each term separately) for the functions A = x ˆx + 2y ˆy + 3z ˆz; B = 3y ˆx − 2x ˆy. (b) Do the same for product rule (ii). (c) Do the same for rule (vi). 1.2.7 Second Derivatives The gradient, the divergence, and the curl are the only ﬁrst derivatives we can make with ∇; by applying ∇ twice, we can construct ﬁve species of second deriva- tives. The gradient ∇T is a vector, so we can take the divergence and curl of it: (1) Divergence of gradient: ∇ · (∇T ). (2) Curl of gradient: ∇ × (∇T ). The divergence ∇ · v is a scalar—all we can do is take its gradient: (3) Gradient of divergence: ∇(∇ · v). The curl ∇ × v is a vector, so we can take its divergence and curl: (4) Divergence of curl: ∇ · (∇ × v). (5) Curl of curl: ∇ × (∇ × v). This exhausts the possibilities, and in fact not all of them give anything new. Let’s consider them one at a time: (1) ∇ · (∇T ) = (ˆx ∂ ∂ x + ˆy ∂ ∂ y + ˆz ∂ ∂z ) · ( ∂ T ∂ x ˆx + ∂ T ∂ y ˆy + ∂ T ∂z ˆz ) = ∂ 2T ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2T ∂ y2 + ∂ 2T ∂z2 . (1.42) 1.2 Differential Calculus 23 This object, which we write as ∇2T for short, is called the Laplacian of T ;we shall be studying it in great detail later on. Notice that the Laplacian of a scalar T is a scalar. Occasionally, we shall speak of the Laplacian of a vector, ∇2v.By this we mean a vector quantity whose x-component is the Laplacian of vx , and so on: 8 ∇2v ≡ (∇2vx )ˆx + (∇2vy)ˆy + (∇2vz)ˆz. (1.43) This is nothing more than a convenient extension of the meaning of ∇2. (2) The curl of a gradient is always zero: ∇ × (∇T ) = 0. (1.44) This is an important fact, which we shall use repeatedly; you can easily prove it from the deﬁnition of ∇, Eq. 1.39. Beware: You might think Eq. 1.44 is “obvi- ously” true—isn’t it just (∇ × ∇)T , and isn’t the cross product of any vector (in this case, ∇) with itself always zero? This reasoning is suggestive, but not quite conclusive, since ∇ is an operator and does not “multiply” in the usual way. The proof of Eq. 1.44, in fact, hinges on the equality of cross derivatives: ∂ ∂ x ( ∂ T ∂ y ) = ∂ ∂ y ( ∂ T ∂ x ) . (1.45) If you think I’m being fussy, test your intuition on this one: (∇T ) × (∇S). Is that always zero? (It would be, of course, if you replaced the ∇’s by an ordinary vector.) (3) ∇(∇ · v) seldom occurs in physical applications, and it has not been given any special name of its own—it’s just the gradient of the divergence. Notice that ∇(∇ · v) is not the same as the Laplacian of a vector: ∇2v = (∇ · ∇)v ̸= ∇(∇ · v). (4) The divergence of a curl, like the curl of a gradient, is always zero: ∇ · (∇ × v) = 0. (1.46) You can prove this for yourself. (Again, there is a fraudulent short-cut proof, using the vector identity A · (B × C) = (A × B) · C.) (5) As you can check from the deﬁnition of ∇: ∇ × (∇ × v) = ∇(∇ · v) −∇2v. (1.47) So curl-of-curl gives nothing new; the ﬁrst term is just number (3), and the sec- ond is the Laplacian (of a vector). (In fact, Eq. 1.47 is often used to deﬁne the 8In curvilinear coordinates, where the unit vectors themselves depend on position, they too must be differentiated (see Sect. 1.4.1). 24 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Laplacian of a vector, in preference to Eq. 1.43, which makes explicit reference to Cartesian coordinates.) Really, then, there are just two kinds of second derivatives: the Laplacian (which is of fundamental importance) and the gradient-of-divergence (which we seldom encounter). We could go through a similar ritual to work out third derivatives, but fortunately second derivatives sufﬁce for practically all physical applications. A ﬁnal word on vector differential calculus: It all ﬂows from the operator ∇, and from taking seriously its vectorial character. Even if you remembered only the deﬁnition of ∇, you could easily reconstruct all the rest. Problem 1.26 Calculate the Laplacian of the following functions: (a) Ta = x 2 + 2xy + 3z + 4. (b) Tb = sin x sin y sin z. (c) Tc = e−5x sin 4y cos 3z. (d) v = x 2 ˆx + 3xz2 ˆy − 2xz ˆz. Problem 1.27 Prove that the divergence of a curl is always zero. Check it for func- tion va in Prob. 1.15. Problem 1.28 Prove that the curl of a gradient is always zero. Check it for function (b) in Prob. 1.11. 1.3 INTEGRAL CALCULUS 1.3.1 Line, Surface, and Volume Integrals In electrodynamics, we encounter several different kinds of integrals, among which the most important are line (or path) integrals, surface integrals (or ﬂux), and volume integrals. (a) Line Integrals. A line integral is an expression of the form ∫ b a v · dl, (1.48) where v is a vector function, dl is the inﬁnitesimal displacement vector (Eq. 1.22), and the integral is to be carried out along a prescribed path P from point a to point b (Fig. 1.20). If the path in question forms a closed loop (that is, if b = a), I shall put a circle on the integral sign: ∮ v · dl. (1.49) At each point on the path, we take the dot product of v (evaluated at that point) with the displacement dl to the next point on the path. To a physicist, the most familiar example of a line integral is the work done by a force F: W = ∫ F · dl. Ordinarily, the value of a line integral depends critically on the path taken from a to b, but there is an important special class of vector functions for which the line 1.3 Integral Calculus 25 y z x a bd l FIGURE 1.20 x y 2 1 12 (2) (1)(i) (ii) b a FIGURE 1.21 integral is independent of path and is determined entirely by the end points. It will be our business in due course to characterize this special class of vectors. (A force that has this property is called conservative.) Example 1.6. Calculate the line integral of the function v = y2 ˆx + 2x(y + 1) ˆy from the point a = (1, 1, 0) to the point b = (2, 2, 0), along the paths (1) and (2) in Fig. 1.21. What is ∮ v · dl for the loop that goes from a to b along (1) and returns to a along (2)? Solution As always, dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz. Path (1) consists of two parts. Along the “horizontal” segment, dy = dz = 0, so (i) dl = dx ˆx, y = 1, v · dl = y2 dx = dx, so ∫ v · dl = ∫ 2 1 dx = 1. On the “vertical” stretch, dx = dz = 0, so (ii) dl = dy ˆy, x = 2, v · dl = 2x(y + 1) dy = 4(y + 1) dy, so ∫ v · dl = 4 ∫ 2 1 (y + 1) dy = 10. By path (1), then, ∫ b a v · dl = 1 + 10 = 11. Meanwhile, on path (2) x = y, dx = dy, and dz = 0, so dl = dx ˆx + dx ˆy, v · dl = x 2 dx + 2x(x + 1) dx = (3x 2 + 2x) dx, and ∫ b a v · dl = ∫ 2 1 (3x 2 + 2x) dx = (x 3 + x 2)∣ ∣2 1 = 10. (The strategy here is to get everything in terms of one variable; I could just as well have eliminated x in favor of y.) 26 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis For the loop that goes out (1) and back (2), then, ∮ v · dl = 11 − 10 = 1. (b) Surface Integrals. A surface integral is an expression of the form ∫ S v · da, (1.50) where v is again some vector function, and the integral is over a speciﬁed surface S.Here da is an inﬁnitesimal patch of area, with direction perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 1.22). There are, of course, two directions perpendicular to any surface, so the sign of a surface integral is intrinsically ambiguous. If the surface is closed (forming a “balloon”), in which case I shall again put a circle on the integral sign ∮ v · da, then tradition dictates that “outward” is positive, but for open surfaces it’s arbi- trary. If v describes the ﬂow of a ﬂuid (mass per unit area per unit time), then∫ v · da represents the total mass per unit time passing through the surface— hence the alternative name, “ﬂux.” Ordinarily, the value of a surface integral depends on the particular surface chosen, but there is a special class of vector functions for which it is independent of the surface and is determined entirely by the boundary line. An important task will be to characterize this special class of functions. x y z da FIGURE 1.22 x y z (iii) (ii) (i) (v) (iv) 2 2 2 FIGURE 1.23 Example 1.7. Calculate the surface integral of v = 2xz ˆx + (x +2) ˆy + y(z2 −3) ˆz over ﬁve sides (excluding the bottom) of the cubical box (side 2) in Fig. 1.23. Let “upward and outward” be the positive direction, as indicated by the arrows. Solution Taking the sides one at a time: 1.3 Integral Calculus 27 (i) x = 2, da = dy dz ˆx, v · da = 2xz dy dz = 4zdydz, so ∫ v · da = 4 ∫ 2 0 dy ∫ 2 0 zdz = 16. (ii) x = 0, da =−dy dz ˆx, v · da =−2xz dy dz = 0, so ∫ v · da = 0. (iii) y = 2, da = dx dz ˆy, v · da = (x + 2) dx dz, so ∫ v · da = ∫ 2 0 (x + 2) dx ∫ 2 0 dz = 12. (iv) y = 0, da =−dx dz ˆy, v · da =−(x + 2) dx dz, so ∫ v · da =− ∫ 2 0 (x + 2) dx ∫ 2 0 dz =−12. (v) z = 2, da = dx dy ˆz, v · da = y(z2 − 3) dx dy = yd x dy, so ∫ v · da = ∫ 2 0 dx ∫ 2 0 ydy = 4. The total ﬂux is ∫ surface v · da = 16 + 0 + 12 − 12 + 4 = 20. (c) Volume Integrals. A volume integral is an expression of the form ∫ V Tdτ, (1.51) where T is a scalar function and dτ is an inﬁnitesimal volume element. In Carte- sian coordinates, dτ = dx dy dz. (1.52) For example, if T is the density of a substance (which might vary from point to point), then the volume integral would give the total mass. Occasionally we shall encounter volume integrals of vector functions: ∫ v dτ = ∫ (vx ˆx + vy ˆy + vz ˆz)dτ = ˆx ∫ vx dτ + ˆy ∫ vydτ + ˆz ∫ vzdτ ; (1.53) because the unit vectors (ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz) are constants, they come outside the integral. 28 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Example 1.8. Calculate the volume integral of T = xyz2 over the prism in Fig. 1.24. Solution You can do the three integrals in any order. Let’s do x ﬁrst: it runs from 0 to (1 − y), then y (it goes from 0 to 1), and ﬁnally z (0 to 3): ∫ Tdτ = ∫ 3 0 z2 {∫ 1 0 y [∫ 1−y 0 xd x] dy} dz = 1 2 ∫ 3 0 z2 dz ∫ 1 0 (1 − y) 2 ydy = 1 2 (9) ( 1 12 ) = 3 8 . x y z 1 1 3 FIGURE 1.24 Problem 1.29 Calculate the line integral of the function v = x 2 ˆx + 2yz ˆy + y2 ˆz from the origin to the point (1,1,1) by three different routes: (a) (0, 0, 0) → (1, 0, 0) → (1, 1, 0) → (1, 1, 1). (b) (0, 0, 0) → (0, 0, 1) → (0, 1, 1) → (1, 1, 1). (c) The direct straight line. (d) What is the line integral around the closed loop that goes out along path (a) and back along path (b)? Problem 1.30 Calculate the surface integral of the function in Ex. 1.7, over the bot- tom of the box. For consistency, let “upward” be the positive direction. Does the surface integral depend only on the boundary line for this function? What is the total ﬂux over the closed surface of the box (including the bottom)? [Note: For the closed surface, the positive direction is “outward,” and hence “down,” for the bottom face.] Problem 1.31 Calculate the volume integral of the function T = z2 over the tetra- hedron with corners at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). 1.3 Integral Calculus 29 1.3.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Suppose f (x) is a function of one variable. The fundamental theorem of calcu- lus says: ∫ b a ( df dx ) dx = f (b) − f (a). (1.54) In case this doesn’t look familiar, I’ll write it another way: ∫ b a F(x) dx = f (b) − f (a), where df /dx = F(x). The fundamental theorem tells you how to integrate F(x): you think up a function f (x) whose derivative is equal to F. Geometrical Interpretation: According to Eq. 1.33, df = (df /dx)dx is the inﬁnitesimal change in f when you go from (x) to (x + dx). The fundamental theorem (Eq. 1.54) says that if you chop the interval from a to b (Fig. 1.25) into many tiny pieces, dx, and add up the increments df from each little piece, the result is (not surprisingly) equal to the total change in f : f (b) − f (a). In other words, there are two ways to determine the total change in the function: either subtract the values at the ends or go step-by-step, adding up all the tiny increments as you go. You’ll get the same answer either way. Notice the basic format of the fundamental theorem: the integral of a derivative over some region is given by the value of the function at the end points (bound- aries). In vector calculus there are three species of derivative (gradient, diver- gence, and curl), and each has its own “fundamental theorem,” with essentially the same format. I don’t plan to prove these theorems here; rather, I will explain what they mean, and try to make them plausible. Proofs are given in Appendix A. 1.3.3 The Fundamental Theorem for Gradients Suppose we have a scalar function of three variables T (x, y, z). Starting at point a, we move a small distance dl1 (Fig. 1.26). According to Eq. 1.37, the function T will change by an amount dT = (∇T ) · dl1. xbdxa f (x) f (b) f (a) FIGURE 1.25 d l1 y z x a b FIGURE 1.26 30 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Now we move a little further, by an additional small displacement dl2; the incre- mental change in T will be (∇T ) · dl2. In this manner, proceeding by inﬁnitesimal steps, we make the journey to point b. At each step we compute the gradient of T (at that point) and dot it into the displacement dl...this gives us the change in T . Evidently the total change in T in going from a to b (along the path selected) is ∫ b a (∇T ) · dl = T (b) − T (a). (1.55) This is the fundamental theorem for gradients; like the “ordinary” fundamental theorem, it says that the integral (here a line integral) of a derivative (here the gradient) is given by the value of the function at the boundaries (a and b). Geometrical Interpretation: Suppose you wanted to determine the height of the Eiffel Tower. You could climb the stairs, using a ruler to measure the rise at each step, and adding them all up (that’s the left side of Eq. 1.55), or you could place altimeters at the top and the bottom, and subtract the two readings (that’s the right side); you should get the same answer either way (that’s the fundamental theorem). Incidentally, as we found in Ex. 1.6, line integrals ordinarily depend on the path taken from a to b.But the right side of Eq. 1.55 makes no reference to the path—only to the end points. Evidently, gradients have the special property that their line integrals are path independent: Corollary 1: ∫ b a (∇T ) · dl is independent of the path taken from a to b. Corollary 2: ∮ (∇T ) · dl = 0, since the beginning and end points are identical, and hence T (b) − T (a) = 0. Example 1.9. Let T = xy2, and take point a to be the origin (0, 0, 0) and b the point (2, 1, 0). Check the fundamental theorem for gradients. Solution Although the integral is independent of path, we must pick a speciﬁc path in order to evaluate it. Let’s go out along the x axis (step i) and then up (step ii) (Fig. 1.27). As always, dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz; ∇T = y2 ˆx + 2xy ˆy. (i) y = 0; dl = dx ˆx, ∇T · dl = y2 dx = 0, so ∫ i ∇T · dl = 0. (ii) x = 2; dl = dy ˆy, ∇T · dl = 2xy dy = 4ydy,so ∫ ii ∇T · dl = ∫ 1 0 4ydy = 2y2∣ ∣ ∣1 0 = 2. 1.3 Integral Calculus 31 x y (iii) (i) 1 1 a b 2 (ii) FIGURE 1.27 The total line integral is 2. Is this consistent with the fundamental theorem? Yes: T (b) − T (a) = 2 − 0 = 2. Now, just to convince you that the answer is independent of path, let me calcu- late the same integral along path iii (the straight line from a to b): (iii) y = 1 2 x, dy = 1 2 dx, ∇T · dl = y2 dx + 2xy dy = 3 4 x 2 dx,so ∫ iii ∇T · dl = ∫ 2 0 3 4 x 2 dx = 1 4 x 3∣ ∣ ∣ 2 0 = 2. Problem 1.32 Check the fundamental theorem for gradients, using T = x 2 + 4xy + 2yz3, the points a = (0, 0, 0), b = (1, 1, 1), and the three paths in Fig. 1.28: (a) (0, 0, 0) → (1, 0, 0) → (1, 1, 0) → (1, 1, 1); (b) (0, 0, 0) → (0, 0, 1) → (0, 1, 1) → (1, 1, 1); (c) the parabolic path z = x 2; y = x. y z (a)x y z (b)x y z (c)x FIGURE 1.28 1.3.4 The Fundamental Theorem for Divergences The fundamental theorem for divergences states that: ∫ V (∇ · v) dτ = ∮ S v · da. (1.56) 32 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis In honor, I suppose, of its great importance, this theorem has at least three special names: Gauss’s theorem, Green’s theorem, or simply the divergence theorem. Like the other “fundamental theorems,” it says that the integral of a derivative (in this case the divergence) over a region (in this case a volume, V) is equal to the value of the function at the boundary (in this case the surface S that bounds the volume). Notice that the boundary term is itself an integral (speciﬁcally, a surface integral). This is reasonable: the “boundary” of a line is just two end points, but the boundary of a volume is a (closed) surface. Geometrical Interpretation: If v represents the ﬂow of an incompressible ﬂuid, then the ﬂux of v (the right side of Eq. 1.56) is the total amount of ﬂuid passing out through the surface, per unit time. Now, the divergence measures the “spreading out” of the vectors from a point—a place of high divergence is like a “faucet,” pouring out liquid. If we have a bunch of faucets in a region ﬁlled with incom- pressible ﬂuid, an equal amount of liquid will be forced out through the bound- aries of the region. In fact, there are two ways we could determine how much is being produced: (a) we could count up all the faucets, recording how much each puts out, or (b) we could go around the boundary, measuring the ﬂow at each point, and add it all up. You get the same answer either way: ∫ (faucets within the volume) = ∮ (ﬂow out through the surface). This, in essence, is what the divergence theorem says. Example 1.10. Check the divergence theorem using the function v = y2 ˆx + (2xy + z2) ˆy + (2yz) ˆz and a unit cube at the origin (Fig. 1.29). Solution In this case ∇ · v = 2(x + y), and ∫ V 2(x + y) dτ = 2 ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 (x + y) dx dy dz, ∫ 1 0 (x + y) dx = 1 2 + y, ∫ 1 0 ( 1 2 + y) dy = 1, ∫ 1 0 1 dz = 1. Thus, ∫ V ∇ · v dτ = 2. 1.3 Integral Calculus 33 x y z (iii) (ii) (i) (v) (vi) (iv) 1 1 1 FIGURE 1.29 So much for the left side of the divergence theorem. To evaluate the surface integral we must consider separately the six faces of the cube: (i) ∫ v · da = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 y2dy dz = 1 3 . (ii) ∫ v · da =− ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 y2 dy dz =− 1 3 . (iii) ∫ v · da = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 (2x + z2) dx dz = 4 3 . (iv) ∫ v · da =− ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 z2 dx dz =− 1 3 . (v) ∫ v · da = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 2yd x dy = 1. (vi) ∫ v · da =− ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 0 dx dy = 0. So the total ﬂux is: ∮ S v · da = 1 3 − 1 3 + 4 3 − 1 3 + 1 + 0 = 2, as expected. Problem 1.33 Test the divergence theorem for the function v = (xy) ˆx + (2yz) ˆy + (3zx) ˆz. Take as your volume the cube shown in Fig. 1.30, with sides of length 2. 34 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis x y z 2 2 2 FIGURE 1.30 1.3.5 The Fundamental Theorem for Curls The fundamental theorem for curls, which goes by the special name of Stokes’ theorem, states that ∫ S (∇ × v) · da = ∮ P v · dl. (1.57) As always, the integral of a derivative (here, the curl) over a region (here, a patch of surface, S) is equal to the value of the function at the boundary (here, the perimeter of the patch, P). As in the case of the divergence theorem, the boundary term is itself an integral—speciﬁcally, a closed line integral. Geometrical Interpretation: Recall that the curl measures the “twist” of the vectors v; a region of high curl is a whirlpool—if you put a tiny paddle wheel there, it will rotate. Now, the integral of the curl over some surface (or, more precisely, the ﬂux of the curl through that surface) represents the “total amount of swirl,” and we can determine that just as well by going around the edge and ﬁnding how much the ﬂow is following the boundary (Fig. 1.31). Indeed, ∮ v · dl is sometimes called the circulation of v. You may have noticed an apparent ambiguity in Stokes’ theorem: concerning the boundary line integral, which way are we supposed to go around (clockwise or counterclockwise)? If we go the “wrong” way, we’ll pick up an overall sign error. The answer is that it doesn’t matter which way you go as long as you are consistent, for there is a compensating sign ambiguity in the surface integral: Which way does da point? For a closed surface (as in the divergence theorem), da points in the direction of the outward normal; but for an open surface, which way is “out”? Consistency in Stokes’ theorem (as in all such matters) is given by the right-hand rule: if your ﬁngers point in the direction of the line integral, then your thumb ﬁxes the direction of da (Fig. 1.32). Now, there are plenty of surfaces (inﬁnitely many) that share any given bound- ary line. Twist a paper clip into a loop, and dip it in soapy water. The soap ﬁlm constitutes a surface, with the wire loop as its boundary. If you blow on it, the soap ﬁlm will expand, making a larger surface, with the same boundary. Ordinarily, a ﬂux integral depends critically on what surface you integrate over, but evidently 1.3 Integral Calculus 35 = FIGURE 1.31 da dl FIGURE 1.32 this is not the case with curls. For Stokes’ theorem says that ∫ (∇ × v) · da is equal to the line integral of v around the boundary, and the latter makes no reference to the speciﬁc surface you choose. Corollary 1: ∫ (∇ × v) · da depends only on the boundary line, not on the particular surface used. Corollary 2: ∮ (∇ × v) · da = 0 for any closed surface, since the boundary line, like the mouth of a balloon, shrinks down to a point, and hence the right side of Eq. 1.57 vanishes. These corollaries are analogous to those for the gradient theorem. We will develop the parallel further in due course. Example 1.11. Suppose v = (2xz + 3y2)ˆy + (4yz2)ˆz. Check Stokes’ theorem for the square surface shown in Fig. 1.33. Solution Here ∇ × v = (4z2 − 2x) ˆx + 2z ˆz and da = dy dz ˆx. x y z 1 1 (iv) (ii) (iii) (i) FIGURE 1.33 (In saying that da points in the x direction, we are committing ourselves to a counterclockwise line integral. We could as well write da =−dy dz ˆx, but then we would be obliged to go clockwise.) Since x = 0 for this surface, ∫ (∇ × v) · da = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 4z2 dy dz = 4 3 . 36 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Now, what about the line integral? We must break this up into four segments: (i) x = 0, z = 0, v · dl = 3y2 dy, ∫ v · dl = ∫ 1 0 3y2 dy = 1, (ii) x = 0, y = 1, v · dl = 4z2 dz, ∫ v · dl = ∫ 1 0 4z2 dz = 4 3 , (iii) x = 0, z = 1, v · dl = 3y2 dy, ∫ v · dl = ∫ 0 1 3y2 dy =−1, (iv) x = 0, y = 0, v · dl = 0, ∫ v · dl = ∫ 0 1 0 dz = 0. So ∮ v · dl = 1 + 4 3 − 1 + 0 = 4 3 . It checks. A point of strategy: notice how I handled step (iii). There is a temptation to write dl =−dy ˆy here, since the path goes to the left. You can get away with this, if you absolutely insist, by running the integral from 0 → 1. But it is much safer to say dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz always (never any minus signs) and let the limits of the integral take care of the direction. Problem 1.34 Test Stokes’ theorem for the function v = (xy) ˆx + (2yz) ˆy + (3zx) ˆz, using the triangular shaded area of Fig. 1.34. Problem 1.35 Check Corollary 1 by using the same function and boundary line as in Ex. 1.11, but integrating over the ﬁve faces of the cube in Fig. 1.35. The back of the cube is open. x y z 2 2 FIGURE 1.34 x y z (iii)(i) (v) (iv) (ii) 1 1 1 FIGURE 1.35 1.3.6 Integration by Parts The technique known (awkwardly) as integration by parts exploits the product rule for derivatives: d dx ( fg) = f ( dg dx ) + g ( df dx ) . 1.3 Integral Calculus 37 Integrating both sides, and invoking the fundamental theorem: ∫ b a d dx ( fg) dx = fg∣ ∣ ∣ b a = ∫ b a f ( dg dx ) dx + ∫ b a g ( df dx ) dx, or ∫ b a f ( dg dx ) dx =− ∫ b a g ( df dx ) dx + fg∣ ∣ ∣ b a. (1.58) That’s integration by parts. It applies to the situation in which you are called upon to integrate the product of one function ( f ) and the derivative of another (g); it says you can transfer the derivative from g to f , at the cost of a minus sign and a boundary term. Example 1.12. Evaluate the integral ∫ ∞ 0 xe−x dx. Solution The exponential can be expressed as a derivative: e−x = d dx (−e−x ) ; in this case, then, f (x) = x, g(x) =−e−x , and df /dx = 1, so ∫ ∞ 0 xe−x dx = ∫ ∞ 0 e−x dx − xe−x ∣ ∣ ∣∞ 0 =−e−x ∣ ∣ ∣∞ 0 = 1. We can exploit the product rules of vector calculus, together with the appro- priate fundamental theorems, in exactly the same way. For example, integrating ∇ · ( f A) = f (∇ · A) + A · (∇ f ) over a volume, and invoking the divergence theorem, yields ∫ ∇ · ( f A) dτ = ∫ f (∇ · A) dτ + ∫ A · (∇ f ) dτ = ∮ f A · da, or ∫ V f (∇ · A) dτ =− ∫ V A · (∇ f ) dτ + ∮ S f A · da. (1.59) Here again the integrand is the product of one function ( f ) and the derivative (in this case the divergence) of another (A), and integration by parts licenses us to 38 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis transfer the derivative from A to f (where it becomes a gradient), at the cost of a minus sign and a boundary term (in this case a surface integral). You might wonder how often one is likely to encounter an integral involving the product of one function and the derivative of another; the answer is surpris- ingly often, and integration by parts turns out to be one of the most powerful tools in vector calculus. Problem 1.36 (a) Show that ∫ S f (∇ × A) · da = ∫ S [A × (∇ f )]· da + ∮ P f A · dl. (1.60) (b) Show that ∫ V B · (∇ × A) dτ = ∫ V A · (∇ × B) dτ + ∮ S (A × B) · da. (1.61) 1.4 CURVILINEAR COORDINATES 1.4.1 Spherical Coordinates You can label a point P by its Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), but sometimes it is more convenient to use spherical coordinates (r,θ,φ); r is the distance from the origin (the magnitude of the position vector r), θ (the angle down from the z axis) is called the polar angle, and φ (the angle around from the x axis) is the azimuthal angle. Their relation to Cartesian coordinates can be read from Fig. 1.36: x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ sin φ, z = r cos θ. (1.62) Figure 1.36 also shows three unit vectors, ˆr, ˆθ , ˆφ, pointing in the direction of increase of the corresponding coordinates. They constitute an orthogonal (mutu- ally perpendicular) basis set (just like ˆx, ˆy, ˆz), and any vector A can be expressed in terms of them, in the usual way: A = Ar ˆr + Aθ ˆθ + Aφ ˆφ; (1.63) Ar , Aθ , and Aφ are the radial, polar, and azimuthal components of A. In terms of the Cartesian unit vectors, ˆr = sin θ cos φ ˆx + sin θ sin φ ˆy + cos θ ˆz, ˆθ = cos θ cos φ ˆx + cos θ sin φ ˆy − sin θ ˆz, ˆφ =− sin φ ˆx + cos φ ˆy, ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ (1.64) as you can check for yourself (Prob. 1.38). I have put these formulas inside the back cover, for easy reference. 1.4 Curvilinear Coordinates 39 x y z θ θ r φ φ r P FIGURE 1.36 But there is a poisonous snake lurking here that I’d better warn you about: ˆr, ˆθ, and ˆφ are associated with a particular point P, and they change direction as P moves around. For example, ˆr always points radially outward, but “radially outward” can be the x direction, the y direction, or any other direction, depend- ing on where you are. In Fig. 1.37, A = ˆy and B =−ˆy, and yet both of them would be written as ˆr in spherical coordinates. One could take account of this by explicitly indicating the point of reference: ˆr(θ, φ), ˆθ (θ, φ), ˆφ(θ, φ), but this would be cumbersome, and as long as you are alert to the problem, I don’t think it will cause difﬁculties. 9 In particular, do not naïvely combine the spherical compo- nents of vectors associated with different points (in Fig. 1.37, A + B = 0, not 2ˆr, and A · B =−1, not +1). Beware of differentiating a vector that is expressed in spherical coordinates, since the unit vectors themselves are functions of position (∂ ˆr/∂θ = ˆθ, for example). And do not take ˆr, ˆθ , and ˆφ outside an integral, as I did with ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz in Eq. 1.53. In general, if you’re uncertain about the validity of an operation, rewrite the problem using Cartesian coordinates, for which this difﬁculty does not arise. An inﬁnitesimal displacement in the ˆr direction is simply dr (Fig. 1.38a), just as an inﬁnitesimal element of length in the x direction is dx: dlr = dr. (1.65) x y z AB 1−1 FIGURE 1.37 9I claimed back at the beginning that vectors have no location, and I’ll stand by that. The vectors themselves live “out there,” completely independent of our choice of coordinates. But the notation we use to represent them does depend on the point in question, in curvilinear coordinates. 40 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis dr r (a) r r dθ dθ (b) (c) rsinθ dφ rsinθ r dφ θ FIGURE 1.38 On the other hand, an inﬁnitesimal element of length in the ˆθ direction (Fig. 1.38b) is not just dθ (that’s an angle—it doesn’t even have the right units for a length); rather, dlθ = rdθ. (1.66) Similarly, an inﬁnitesimal element of length in the ˆφ direction (Fig. 1.38c) is dlφ = r sin θ dφ. (1.67) Thus the general inﬁnitesimal displacement dl is dl = dr ˆr + rdθ ˆθ + r sin θ dφ ˆφ. (1.68) This plays the role (in line integrals, for example) that dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz played in Cartesian coordinates. The inﬁnitesimal volume element dτ , in spherical coordinates, is the product of the three inﬁnitesimal displacements: dτ = dlr dlθ dlφ = r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ. (1.69) I cannot give you a general expression for surface elements da, since these depend on the orientation of the surface. You simply have to analyze the geometry for any given case (this goes for Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates alike). If you are integrating over the surface of a sphere, for instance, then r is constant, whereas θ and φ change (Fig. 1.39), so da1 = dlθ dlφ ˆr = r 2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr. On the other hand, if the surface lies in the xy plane, say, so that θ is constant (to wit: π/2) while r and φ vary, then da2 = dlr dlφ ˆθ = rdrdφ ˆθ . Notice, ﬁnally, that r ranges from 0 to ∞, φ from 0 to 2π , and θ from 0 to π (not 2π —that would count every point twice).10 10Alternatively, you could run φ from 0 to π (the “eastern hemisphere”) and cover the “western hemi- sphere” by extending θ from π up to 2π . But this is very bad notation, since, among other things, sin θ will then run negative, and you’ll have to put absolute value signs around that term in volume and surface elements (area and volume being intrinsically positive quantities). 1.4 Curvilinear Coordinates 41 x y da1 z da2 FIGURE 1.39 Example 1.13. Find the volume of a sphere of radius R. Solution V = ∫ dτ = ∫ R r =0 ∫ π θ=0 ∫ 2π φ=0 r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ = (∫ R 0 r 2 dr )(∫ π 0 sin θ dθ )(∫ 2π 0 dφ) = ( R3 3 ) (2)(2π) = 4 3 π R3 (not a big surprise). So far we have talked only about the geometry of spherical coordinates. Now I would like to “translate” the vector derivatives (gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian) into r , θ , φ notation. In principle, this is entirely straightforward: in the case of the gradient, ∇T = ∂ T ∂ x ˆx + ∂ T ∂ y ˆy + ∂ T ∂z ˆz, for instance, we would ﬁrst use the chain rule to expand the partials: ∂ T ∂ x = ∂ T ∂r ( ∂r ∂ x ) + ∂ T ∂θ ( ∂θ ∂ x ) + ∂ T ∂φ ( ∂φ ∂ x ) . The terms in parentheses could be worked out from Eq. 1.62—or rather, the in- verse of those equations (Prob. 1.37). Then we’d do the same for ∂ T /∂ y and ∂ T /∂z. Finally, we’d substitute in the formulas for ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz in terms of ˆr, ˆθ , and ˆφ (Prob. 1.38). It would take an hour to ﬁgure out the gradient in spherical coordinates by this brute-force method. I suppose this is how it was ﬁrst done, but there is a much more efﬁcient indirect approach, explained in Appendix A, which 42 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis has the extra advantage of treating all coordinate systems at once. I described the “straightforward” method only to show you that there is nothing subtle or mys- terious about transforming to spherical coordinates: you’re expressing the same quantity (gradient, divergence, or whatever) in different notation, that’s all. Here, then, are the vector derivatives in spherical coordinates: Gradient: ∇T = ∂ T ∂r ˆr + 1 r ∂ T ∂θ ˆθ + 1 r sin θ ∂ T ∂φ ˆφ. (1.70) Divergence: ∇ · v = 1 r 2 ∂ ∂r (r 2vr ) + 1 r sin θ ∂ ∂θ (sin θvθ ) + 1 r sin θ ∂vφ ∂φ . (1.71) Curl: ∇ × v = 1 r sin θ [ ∂ ∂θ (sin θvφ) − ∂vθ ∂φ ] ˆr + 1 r [ 1 sin θ ∂vr ∂φ − ∂ ∂r (r vφ)] ˆθ + 1 r [ ∂ ∂r (r vθ ) − ∂vr ∂θ ] ˆφ. (1.72) Laplacian: ∇2T = 1 r 2 ∂ ∂r ( r 2 ∂ T ∂r ) + 1 r 2 sin θ ∂ ∂θ ( sin θ ∂ T ∂θ ) + 1 r 2 sin 2 θ ∂ 2T ∂φ2 . (1.73) For reference, these formulas are listed inside the front cover. Problem 1.37 Find formulas for r,θ,φ in terms of x, y, z (the inverse, in other words, of Eq. 1.62). Problem 1.38 Express the unit vectors ˆr, ˆθ, ˆφ in terms of ˆx, ˆy, ˆz (that is, derive• Eq. 1.64). Check your answers several ways (ˆr · ˆr ? = 1, ˆθ · ˆφ ? = 0, ˆr × ˆθ ? = ˆφ,...). Also work out the inverse formulas, giving ˆx, ˆy, ˆz in terms of ˆr, ˆθ , ˆφ (and θ, φ).

Check the divergence theorem for this function, using as your volume the inverted hemispherical bowl of radius R,restingonthe xy plane and centered at the origin (Fig. 1.40). 1.4 Curvilinear Coordinates 43 x y z R FIGURE 1.40 x y z 2 2 2 FIGURE 1.41 Problem 1.41 Compute the gradient and Laplacian of the function T = r (cos θ + sin θ cos φ). Check the Laplacian by converting T to Cartesian coordinates and using Eq. 1.42. Test the gradient theorem for this function, using the path shown in Fig. 1.41, from (0, 0, 0) to (0, 0, 2). 1.4.2 Cylindrical Coordinates The cylindrical coordinates (s,φ, z) of a point P are deﬁned in Fig. 1.42. Notice that φ has the same meaning as in spherical coordinates, and z is the same as Cartesian; s is the distance to P from the z axis, whereas the spherical coordinate r is the distance from the origin. The relation to Cartesian coordinates is x = s cos φ, y = s sin φ, z = z. (1.74) The unit vectors (Prob. 1.42) are ˆs = cos φ ˆx + sin φ ˆy, ˆφ =− sin φ ˆx + cos φ ˆy, ˆz = ˆz. ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ (1.75) The inﬁnitesimal displacements are dls = ds, dlφ = sdφ, dlz = dz, (1.76) x z φ s y z z φ s P FIGURE 1.42 44 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis so dl = ds ˆs + sdφ ˆφ + dz ˆz, (1.77) and the volume element is dτ = sdsdφ dz. (1.78) The range of s is 0 →∞,φ goes from 0 → 2π , and z from −∞ to ∞. The vector derivatives in cylindrical coordinates are: Gradient: ∇T = ∂ T ∂s ˆs + 1 s ∂ T ∂φ ˆφ + ∂ T ∂z ˆz. (1.79) Divergence: ∇ · v = 1 s ∂ ∂s (svs) + 1 s ∂vφ ∂φ + ∂vz ∂z . (1.80) Curl: ∇ × v = ( 1 s ∂vz ∂φ − ∂vφ ∂z ) ˆs + ( ∂vs ∂z − ∂vz ∂s ) ˆφ + 1 s [ ∂ ∂s (svφ) − ∂vs ∂φ ] ˆz. (1.81) Laplacian: ∇2T = 1 s ∂ ∂s ( s ∂ T ∂s ) + 1 s2 ∂ 2T ∂φ2 + ∂ 2T ∂z2 . (1.82) These formulas are also listed inside the front cover.

(b) Test the divergence theorem for this function, using the quarter-cylinder (radius 2, height 5) shown in Fig. 1.43. (c) Find the curl of v. 1.5 THE DIRAC DELTA FUNCTION 1.5.1 The Divergence of ˆr/r 2 Consider the vector function v = 1 r 2 ˆr. (1.83) At every location, v is directed radially outward (Fig. 1.44); if ever there was a function that ought to have a large positive divergence, this is it. And yet, when you actually calculate the divergence (using Eq. 1.71), you get precisely zero: ∇ · v = 1 r 2 ∂ ∂r ( r 2 1 r 2 ) = 1 r 2 ∂ ∂r (1) = 0. (1.84) (You will have encountered this paradox already, if you worked Prob. 1.16.) The plot thickens when we apply the divergence theorem to this function. Suppose we integrate over a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin (Prob. 1.38b); the surface integral is ∮ v · da = ∫ ( 1 R2 ˆr) · (R2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr) = (∫ π 0 sin θ dθ )(∫ 2π 0 dφ) = 4π. (1.85) FIGURE 1.44 46 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis But the volume integral, ∫ ∇ · v dτ ,is zero, if we are really to believe Eq. 1.84. Does this mean that the divergence theorem is false? What’s going on here? The source of the problem is the point r = 0, where v blows up (and where, in Eq. 1.84, we have unwittingly divided by zero). It is quite true that ∇ · v = 0 everywhere except the origin, but right at the origin the situation is more com- plicated. Notice that the surface integral (Eq. 1.85) is independent of R;ifthe divergence theorem is right (and it is), we should get ∫ (∇ · v) dτ = 4π for any sphere centered at the origin, no matter how small. Evidently the entire contribu- tion must be coming from the point r = 0! Thus, ∇ · v has the bizarre property that it vanishes everywhere except at one point, and yet its integral (over any volume containing that point) is 4π. No ordinary function behaves like that. (On the other hand, a physical example does come to mind: the density (mass per unit volume) of a point particle. It’s zero except at the exact location of the particle, and yet its integral is ﬁnite—namely, the mass of the particle.) What we have stum- bled on is a mathematical object known to physicists as the Dirac delta function. It arises in many branches of theoretical physics. Moreover, the speciﬁc problem at hand (the divergence of the function ˆr/r 2) is not just some arcane curiosity—it is, in fact, central to the whole theory of electrodynamics. So it is worthwhile to pause here and study the Dirac delta function with some care. 1.5.2 The One-Dimensional Dirac Delta Function The one-dimensional Dirac delta function, δ(x), can be pictured as an inﬁnitely high, inﬁnitesimally narrow “spike,” with area 1 (Fig. 1.45). That is to say: δ(x) = { 0, if x ̸= 0 ∞, if x = 0 } (1.86) and 11 ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(x) dx = 1. (1.87) x δ(x) Area 1 a FIGURE 1.45 11Notice that the dimensions of δ(x) are one over the dimensions of its argument; if x is a length, δ(x) carries the units m−1. 1.5 The Dirac Delta Function 47 x R2(x) R1(x) 1 2 −1/2 −1/4 1/4 1/2 (a) x T2(x) 1 2 −1 −1/2 1/2 1 T1(x) (b) FIGURE 1.46 Technically, δ(x) is not a function at all, since its value is not ﬁnite at x = 0; in the mathematical literature it is known as a generalized function,or distribution.It is, if you like, the limit of a sequence of functions, such as rectangles Rn(x),of height n and width 1/n, or isosceles triangles Tn(x), of height n and base 2/n (Fig. 1.46). If f (x) is some “ordinary” function (that is, not another delta function—in fact, just to be on the safe side, let’s say that f (x) is continuous), then the product f (x)δ(x) is zero everywhere except at x = 0. It follows that f (x)δ(x) = f (0)δ(x). (1.88) (This is the most important fact about the delta function, so make sure you under- stand why it is true: since the product is zero anyway except at x = 0, we may as well replace f (x) by the value it assumes at the origin.) In particular ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(x) dx = f (0) ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(x) dx = f (0). (1.89) Under an integral, then, the delta function “picks out” the value of f (x) at x = 0. (Here and below, the integral need not run from −∞ to +∞; it is sufﬁcient that the domain extend across the delta function, and −ϵ to +ϵ would do as well.) Of course, we can shift the spike from x = 0 to some other point, x = a (Fig. 1.47): xa δ(x − a) Area 1 FIGURE 1.47 48 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis δ(x − a) = { 0, if x ̸= a ∞, if x = a } with ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(x − a) dx = 1. (1.90) Equation 1.88 becomes f (x)δ(x − a) = f (a)δ(x − a), (1.91) and Eq. 1.89 generalizes to ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(x − a) dx = f (a). (1.92) Example 1.14. Evaluate the integral ∫ 3 0 x 3δ(x − 2) dx. Solution The delta function picks out the value of x 3 at the point x = 2, so the integral is 2 3 = 8. Notice, however, that if the upper limit had been 1 (instead of 3), the answer would be 0, because the spike would then be outside the domain of inte- gration. Although δ itself is not a legitimate function, integrals over δ are perfectly acceptable. In fact, it’s best to think of the delta function as something that is always intended for use under an integral sign. In particular, two expressions involving delta functions (say, D1(x) and D2(x)) are considered equal if 12 ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)D1(x) dx = ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)D2(x) dx, (1.93) for all (“ordinary”) functions f (x). Example 1.15. Show that δ(kx) = 1 |k| δ(x), (1.94) where k is any (nonzero) constant. (In particular, δ(−x) = δ(x).) 12I emphasize that the integrals must be equal for any f (x). Suppose D1(x) and D2(x) actually differed, say, in the neighborhood of the point x = 17. Then we could pick a function f (x) that was sharply peaked about x = 17, and the integrals would not be equal. 1.5 The Dirac Delta Function 49 Solution For an arbitrary test function f (x), consider the integral ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(kx) dx. Changing variables, we let y ≡ kx, so that x = y/k, and dx = 1/kdy.If k is positive, the integration still runs from −∞ to +∞,but if k is negative, then x =∞ implies y =−∞, and vice versa, so the order of the limits is reversed. Restoring the “proper” order costs a minus sign. Thus ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(kx) dx =± ∫ ∞ −∞ f (y/k)δ(y) dy k =± 1 k f (0) = 1 |k| f (0). (The lower signs apply when k is negative, and we account for this neatly by putting absolute value bars around the ﬁnal k, as indicated.) Under the integral sign, then, δ(kx) serves the same purpose as (1/|k|)δ(x): ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(kx) dx = ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x) [ 1 |k| δ(x)] dx. According to the criterion Eq. 1.93, therefore, δ(kx) and (1/|k|)δ(x) are equal. Problem 1.44 Evaluate the following integrals: (a) ∫ 6 2 (3x 2 − 2x − 1)δ(x − 3) dx. (b) ∫ 5 0 cos x δ(x − π) dx. (c) ∫ 3 0 x 3δ(x + 1) dx. (d) ∫ ∞ −∞ ln(x + 3)δ(x + 2) dx. Problem 1.45 Evaluate the following integrals: (a) ∫ 2 −2(2x + 3)δ(3x) dx. (b) ∫ 2 0 (x 3 + 3x + 2)δ(1 − x) dx. (c) ∫ 1 −1 9x 2δ(3x + 1) dx. (d) ∫ a −∞ δ(x − b) dx. Problem 1.46 (a) Show that x d dx (δ(x)) =−δ(x). [Hint: Use integration by parts.] 50 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis (b) Let θ(x) be the step function: θ(x) ≡ ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1, if x > 0 0, if x ≤ 0 ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ . (1.95) Show that dθ/dx = δ(x). 1.5.3 The Three-Dimensional Delta Function It is easy to generalize the delta function to three dimensions: δ3(r) = δ(x)δ(y)δ(z). (1.96) (As always, r ≡ x ˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz is the position vector, extending from the origin to the point (x, y, z).) This three-dimensional delta function is zero everywhere except at (0, 0, 0), where it blows up. Its volume integral is 1: ∫ all space δ3(r) dτ = ∫ ∞ −∞ ∫ ∞ −∞ ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(x)δ(y)δ(z) dx dy dz = 1. (1.97) And, generalizing Eq. 1.92, ∫ all space f (r)δ3(r − a) dτ = f (a). (1.98) As in the one-dimensional case, integration with δ picks out the value of the func- tion f at the location of the spike. We are now in a position to resolve the paradox introduced in Sect. 1.5.1. As you will recall, we found that the divergence of ˆr/r 2 is zero everywhere ex- cept at the origin, and yet its integral over any volume containing the origin is a constant (to wit: 4π ). These are precisely the deﬁning conditions for the Dirac delta function; evidently ∇ · ( ˆr r 2 ) = 4πδ3(r). (1.99) More generally, ∇ · ( ˆr r2 ) = 4πδ3(r), (1.100) where, as always, r is the separation vector: r ≡ r − r [. Note that differentiation here is with respect to r, while r [ is held constant. Incidentally, since ∇ ( 1 r ) =− ˆr r2 (1.101) 1.5 The Dirac Delta Function 51 (Prob. 1.13b), it follows that ∇2 1 r =−4πδ3(r). (1.102) Example 1.16. Evaluate the integral J = ∫ V (r 2 + 2) ∇ · ( ˆr r 2 ) dτ, where V is a sphere 13 of radius R centered at the origin. Solution 1 Use Eq. 1.99 to rewrite the divergence, and Eq. 1.98 to do the integral: J = ∫ V (r 2 + 2)4πδ3(r) dτ = 4π(0 + 2) = 8π. This one-line solution demonstrates something of the power and beauty of the delta function, but I would like to show you a second method, which is much more cumbersome but serves to illustrate the method of integration by parts (Sect. 1.3.6). Solution 2 Using Eq. 1.59, we transfer the derivative from ˆr/r 2 to (r 2 + 2): J =− ∫ V ˆr r 2 ·[∇(r 2 + 2)] dτ + ∮ S (r 2 + 2) ˆr r 2 · da. The gradient is ∇(r 2 + 2) = 2r ˆr, so the volume integral becomes ∫ 2 r dτ = ∫ 2 r r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ = 8π ∫ R 0 rdr = 4π R2. Meanwhile, on the boundary of the sphere (where r = R), da = R2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr, so the surface integral is ∫ (R2 + 2) sin θ dθ dφ = 4π(R2 + 2). 13In proper mathematical jargon, “sphere” denotes the surface, and “ball” the volume it encloses. But physicists are (as usual) sloppy about this sort of thing, and I use the word “sphere” for both the surface and the volume. Where the meaning is not clear from the context, I will write “spherical surface” or “spherical volume.” The language police tell me that the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron, but a poll of my physics colleagues reveals that this is (for us) the standard usage. 52 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis Putting it all together, J =−4π R2 + 4π(R2 + 2) = 8π, as before. Problem 1.47 (a) Write an expression for the volume charge density ρ(r) of a point charge q at r [. Make sure that the volume integral of ρ equals q. (b) What is the volume charge density of an electric dipole, consisting of a point charge −q at the origin and a point charge +q at a? (c) What is the volume charge density (in spherical coordinates) of a uniform, in- ﬁnitesimally thin spherical shell of radius R and total charge Q,centeredatthe origin? [Beware: the integral over all space must equal Q.] Problem 1.48 Evaluate the following integrals: (a) ∫ (r 2 + r · a + a2)δ3(r − a) dτ ,where a is a ﬁxed vector, a is its magnitude, and the integral is over all space. (b) ∫ V |r − b|2δ3(5r) dτ ,where V is a cube of side 2, centered on the origin, and b = 4 ˆy + 3 ˆz. (c) ∫ V [ r 4 + r 2(r · c) + c4] δ3(r − c) dτ ,where V is a sphere of radius 6 about the origin, c = 5 ˆx + 3 ˆy + 2 ˆz,and c is its magnitude. (d) ∫ V r · (d − r)δ3(e − r) dτ ,where d = (1, 2, 3), e = (3, 2, 1),and V is a sphere of radius 1.5 centered at (2, 2, 2). Problem 1.49 Evaluate the integral J = ∫ V e−r (∇ · ˆr r 2 ) dτ (where V is a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin) by two different methods, as in Ex. 1.16. 1.6 THE THEORY OF VECTOR FIELDS 1.6.1 The Helmholtz Theorem Ever since Faraday, the laws of electricity and magnetism have been expressed in terms of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B. Like many physical laws, 1.6 The Theory of Vector Fields 53 these are most compactly expressed as differential equations. Since E and B are vectors, the differential equations naturally involve vector derivatives: divergence and curl. Indeed, Maxwell reduced the entire theory to four equations, specifying respectively the divergence and the curl of E and B. Maxwell’s formulation raises an important mathematical question: To what extent is a vector function determined by its divergence and curl? In other words, if I tell you that the divergence of F (which stands for E or B, as the case may be) is a speciﬁed (scalar) function D, ∇ · F = D, and the curl of F is a speciﬁed (vector) function C, ∇ × F = C, (for consistency, C must be divergenceless, ∇ · C = 0, because the divergence of a curl is always zero), can you then determine the function F? Well. . . not quite. For example, as you may have discovered in Prob. 1.20, there are many functions whose divergence and curl are both zero everywhere—the triv- ial case F = 0, of course, but also F = yz ˆx + zx ˆy + xy ˆz, F = sin x cosh y ˆx − cos x sinh y ˆy, etc. To solve a differential equation you must also be supplied with appropriate boundary conditions. In electrodynamics we typically require that the ﬁelds go to zero “at inﬁnity” (far away from all charges).14 With that ex- tra information, the Helmholtz theorem guarantees that the ﬁeld is uniquely determined by its divergence and curl. (The Helmholtz theorem is discussed in Appendix B.) 1.6.2 Potentials If the curl of a vector ﬁeld (F) vanishes (everywhere), then F can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential (V ): ∇ × F = 0 ⇐⇒ F =−∇V. (1.103) (The minus sign is purely conventional.) That’s the essential burden of the follow- ing theorem: Theorem 1 Curl-less (or “irrotational”) ﬁelds. The following conditions are equivalent (that is, F satisﬁes one if and only if it satisﬁes all the others): 14In some textbook problems the charge itself extends to inﬁnity (we speak, for instance, of the electric ﬁeld of an inﬁnite plane, or the magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnite wire). In such cases the normal boundary conditions do not apply, and one must invoke symmetry arguments to determine the ﬁelds uniquely. 54 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis (a) ∇ × F = 0 everywhere. (b) ∫ b a F · dl is independent of path, for any given end points. (c) ∮ F · dl = 0 for any closed loop. (d) F is the gradient of some scalar function: F =−∇V . The potential is not unique—any constant can be added to V with impunity, since this will not affect its gradient. If the divergence of a vector ﬁeld (F) vanishes (everywhere), then F can be expressed as the curl of a vector potential (A): ∇ · F = 0 ⇐⇒ F = ∇ × A. (1.104) That’s the main conclusion of the following theorem: Theorem 2 Divergence-less (or “solenoidal”) ﬁelds. The following conditions are equivalent: (a) ∇ · F = 0 everywhere. (b) ∫ F · da is independent of surface, for any given boundary line. (c) ∮ F · da = 0 for any closed surface. (d) F is the curl of some vector function: F = ∇ × A. The vector potential is not unique—the gradient of any scalar function can be added to A without affecting the curl, since the curl of a gradient is zero. You should by now be able to prove all the connections in these theorems, save for the ones that say (a), (b), or (c) implies (d). Those are more subtle, and will come later. Incidentally, in all cases (whatever its curl and divergence may be) a vector ﬁeld F can be written as the gradient of a scalar plus the curl of a vector:15 F =−∇V + ∇ × A (always). (1.105) Problem 1.50 (a) Let F1 = x 2 ˆz and F2 = x ˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz. Calculate the divergence and curl of F1 and F2. Which one can be written as the gradient of a scalar? Find a scalar potential that does the job. Which one can be written as the curl of a vector? Find a suitable vector potential. 15In physics, the word ﬁeld denotes generically any function of position (x, y, z) and time (t). But in electrodynamics two particular ﬁelds (E and B) are of such paramount importance as to preempt the term. Thus technically the potentials are also “ﬁelds,” but we never call them that. 1.6 The Theory of Vector Fields 55 (b) Show that F3 = yz ˆx + zx ˆy + xy ˆz can be written both as the gradient of a scalar and as the curl of a vector.

Problem 1.52 For Theorem 2, show that (d) ⇒ (a), (a) ⇒ (c), (c) ⇒ (b), (b) ⇒ (c), and (c) ⇒ (a). Problem 1.53 (a) Which of the vectors in Problem 1.15 can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar? Find a scalar function that does the job. (b) Which can be expressed as the curl of a vector? Find such a vector.

CHAPTER 2 Electrostatics 2.1 THE ELECTRIC FIELD 2.1.1 Introduction The fundamental problem electrodynamics hopes to solve is this (Fig. 2.1): We have some electric charges, q1, q2, q3,... (call them source charges); what force do they exert on another charge, Q (call it the test charge)? The positions of the source charges are given (as functions of time); the trajectory of the test particle is to be calculated. In general, both the source charges and the test charge are in motion. The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposition, which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on Q, we can ﬁrst compute the force F1, due to q1 alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute the force F2, due to q2 alone; and so on. Finally, we take the vector sum of all these individual forces: F = F1 + F2 + F3 + ... Thus, if we can ﬁnd the force on Q due to a single source charge q, we are, in principle, done (the rest is just a question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up).1 Well, at ﬁrst sight this looks very easy: Why don’t I just write down the formula for the force on Q due to q, and be done with it? I could, and in Chapter 10 I shall, but you would be shocked to see it at this stage, for not only does the force on Q depend on the separation distance r between the charges (Fig. 2.2), it also q2 Q “Source” charges “Test” charge q1 qi FIGURE 2.1 Q q r FIGURE 2.2 1The principle of superposition may seem “obvious” to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if the electromagnetic force were proportional to the square of the total source charge, for instance, the principle of superposition would not hold, since (q1 + q2)2 ⃝= q2 1 + q2 2 (there would be “cross terms” to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact. 59 60 Chapter 2 Electrostatics depends on both their velocities and on the acceleration of q. Moreover, it is not the position, velocity, and acceleration of q right now that matter: electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light, so what concerns Q is the position, velocity, and acceleration q had at some earlier time, when the message left. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the basic question (“What is the force on Q due to q?”) is easy to state, it does not pay to confront it head on; rather, we shall go at it by stages. In the meantime, the theory we develop will allow for the solution of more subtle electromagnetic problems that do not present themselves in quite this simple format. To begin with, we shall consider the special case of electrostatics in which all the source charges are stationary (though the test charge may be moving). 2.1.2 Coulomb’s Law What is the force on a test charge Q due to a single point charge q, that is at rest a distance r away? The answer (based on experiments) is given by Coulomb’s law: F = 1 4πϵ0 qQ r2 ˆr. (2.1) The constant ϵ0 is called (ludicrously) the permittivity of free space. In SI units, where force is in newtons (N), distance in meters (m), and charge in coulombs (C), ϵ0 = 8.85 × 10 −12 C 2 N · m2 . In words, the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance. As always (Sect. 1.1.4), r is the separation vector from r ˙ (the location of q)to r (the location of Q): r = r − r ˙; (2.2) r is its magnitude, and ˆr is its direction. The force points along the line from q to Q; it is repulsive if q and Q have the same sign, and attractive if their signs are opposite. Coulomb’s law and the principle of superposition constitute the physical input for electrostatics—the rest, except for some special properties of matter, is math- ematical elaboration of these fundamental rules. Problem 2.1 (a) Twelve equal charges, q, are situated at the corners of a regular 12-sided poly- gon (for instance, one on each numeral of a clock face). What is the net force on a test charge Q at the center? (b) Suppose one of the 12 q’s is removed (the one at “6 o’clock”). What is the force on Q? Explain your reasoning carefully. 2.1 The Electric Field 61 (c) Now 13 equal charges, q, are placed at the corners of a regular 13-sided polygon. What is the force on a test charge Q at the center? (d) If one of the 13 q’s is removed, what is the force on Q? Explain your reasoning. 2.1.3 The Electric Field If we have several point charges q1, q2,..., qn, at distances r1, r2,..., rn from Q, the total force on Q is evidently F = F1 + F2 + ... = 1 4πϵ0 √ q1 Q r2 1 ˆr1 + q2 Q r 2 2 ˆr2 + ...) = Q 4πϵ0 √ q1 r 2 1 ˆr1 + q2 r 2 2 ˆr2 + q3 r 2 3 ˆr3 + ... ) , or F = QE, (2.3) where E(r) ≡ 1 4πϵ0 n∑ i=1 qi r2 i ˆri . (2.4) E is called the electric ﬁeld of the source charges. Notice that it is a function of position (r), because the separation vectors ri depend on the location of the ﬁeld point P (Fig. 2.3). But it makes no reference to the test charge Q. The electric ﬁeld is a vector quantity that varies from point to point and is determined by the conﬁguration of source charges; physically, E(r) is the force per unit charge that would be exerted on a test charge, if you were to place one at P. What exactly is an electric ﬁeld? I have deliberately begun with what you might call the “minimal” interpretation of E, as an intermediate step in the calculation of electric forces. But I encourage you to think of the ﬁeld as a “real” physical z x y P Source point q1 ri rr\u0002i q2 qi Field point FIGURE 2.3 62 Chapter 2 Electrostatics entity, ﬁlling the space around electric charges. Maxwell himself came to believe that electric and magnetic ﬁelds are stresses and strains in an invisible primordial jellylike “ether.” Special relativity has forced us to abandon the notion of ether, and with it Maxwell’s mechanical interpretation of electromagnetic ﬁelds. (It is even possible, though cumbersome, to formulate classical electrodynamics as an “action-at-a-distance” theory, and dispense with the ﬁeld concept altogether.) I can’t tell you, then, what a ﬁeld is—only how to calculate it and what it can do for you once you’ve got it. Example 2.1. Find the electric ﬁeld a distance z above the midpoint between two equal charges (q), a distance d apart (Fig. 2.4a). Solution Let E1 be the ﬁeld of the left charge alone, and E2 that of the right charge alone (Fig. 2.4b). Adding them (vectorially), the horizontal components cancel and the vertical components conspire: Ez = 2 1 4πϵ0 q r2 cos θ. Here r = √z2 + (d/2)2 and cos θ = z/r,so E = 1 4πϵ0 2qz [z2 + (d/2)2]3/2 ˆz. Check: When z [ d you’re so far away that it just looks like a single charge 2q, so the ﬁeld should reduce to E = 1 4πϵ0 2q z2 ˆz.And it does (just set d → 0inthe formula). q x z q P z d/2 d/2 (a) q xq z θ d/2 d/2 (b) E2 E1 E r FIGURE 2.4 Problem 2.2 Find the electric ﬁeld (magnitude and direction) a distance z above the midpoint between equal and opposite charges (±q), a distance d apart (same as Example 2.1, except that the charge at x =+d/2is −q). 2.1 The Electric Field 63 r r r P P P dq da\u0002 dl\u0002 dτ\u0002 (a) Continuous distribution (c) Surface charge, σ (d) Volume charge, ρ r P (b) Line charge, λ FIGURE 2.5 2.1.4 Continuous Charge Distributions Our deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld (Eq. 2.4) assumes that the source of the ﬁeld is a collection of discrete point charges qi . If, instead, the charge is distributed continuously over some region, the sum becomes an integral (Fig. 2.5a): E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ 1 r2 ˆr dq. (2.5) If the charge is spread out along a line (Fig. 2.5b), with charge-per-unit-length λ, then dq = λ dl ˙ (where dl ˙ is an element of length along the line); if the charge is smeared out over a surface (Fig. 2.5c), with charge-per-unit-area σ , then dq = σ da˙ (where da˙ is an element of area on the surface); and if the charge ﬁlls a volume (Fig. 2.5d), with charge-per-unit-volume ρ, then dq = ρ dτ ˙ (where dτ ˙ is an element of volume): dq → λ dl ˙ ∼ σ da˙ ∼ ρ dτ ˙. Thus the electric ﬁeld of a line charge is E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ λ(r ˙) r2 ˆr dl ˙; (2.6) for a surface charge, E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ σ(r ˙) r2 ˆr da˙; (2.7) and for a volume charge, E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r ˙) r2 ˆr dτ ˙. (2.8) 64 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Equation 2.8 itself is often referred to as “Coulomb’s law,” because it is such a short step from the original (2.1), and because a volume charge is in a sense the most general and realistic case. Please note carefully the meaning of r in these formulas. Originally, in Eq. 2.4, ri stood for the vector from the source charge qi to the ﬁeld point r. Correspondingly, in Eqs. 2.5–2.8, r is the vector from dq (therefore from dl ˙, da˙,or dτ ˙) to the ﬁeld point r.2 Example 2.2. Find the electric ﬁeld a distance z above the midpoint of a straight line segment of length 2L that carries a uniform line charge λ (Fig. 2.6). x dx r P x z FIGURE 2.6 Solution The simplest method is to chop the line into symmetrically placed pairs (at ±x), quote the result of Ex. 2.1 (with d/2 → x, q → λ dx), and integrate (x : 0 → L). But here’s a more general approach:3 r = z ˆz, r ˙ = x ˆx, dl ˙ = dx; r = r − r ˙ = z ˆz − x ˆx, r = √z2 + x 2, ˆr = r r = z ˆz − x ˆx √z2 + x 2 . E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ L −L λ z2 + x 2 z ˆz − x ˆx √z2 + x 2 dx = λ 4πϵ0 [z ˆz ∫ L −L 1 (z2 + x 2)3/2 dx − ˆx ∫ L −L x (z2 + x 2)3/2 dx] = λ 4πϵ0 [ z ˆz √ x z2√z2 + x 2 )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ L −L − ˆx √ − 1 √z2 + x 2 )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ L −L ] = 1 4πϵ0 2λL z√z2 + L 2 ˆz. 2Warning: The unit vector ˆr is not constant; its direction depends on the source point r˙, and hence it cannot be taken outside the integrals (Eqs. 2.5–2.8). In practice, you must work with Cartesian components (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz are constant, and do come out), even if you use curvilinear coordinates to perform the integration. 3Ordinarily I’ll put a prime on the source coordinates, but where no confusion can arise I’ll remove the prime to simplify the notation. 2.1 The Electric Field 65 For points far from the line (z [ L), E ∼= 1 4πϵ0 2λL z2 . This makes sense: From far away the line looks like a point charge q = 2λL.In the limit L →∞, on the other hand, we obtain the ﬁeld of an inﬁnite straight wire: E = 1 4πϵ0 2λ z .

Equation 2.8 tells us how to compute the ﬁeld of a charge distribution, and Eq. 2.3 tells us what the force on a charge Q placed in this ﬁeld will be. Unfortunately, as you may have discovered in working Prob. 2.7, the integrals involved in computing E can be formidable, even for reasonably simple charge distributions. Much of the rest of electrostatics is devoted to assembling a bag of tools and tricks for avoiding these integrals. It all begins with the divergence and curl of E. I shall calculate the divergence of E directly from Eq. 2.8, in Sect. 2.2.2, but ﬁrst I want to show you a more qualitative, and perhaps more illuminating, intuitive approach. Let’s begin with the simplest possible case: a single point charge q, situated at the origin: E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 ˆr. (2.10) To get a “feel” for this ﬁeld, I might sketch a few representative vectors, as in Fig. 2.12a. Because the ﬁeld falls off like 1/r 2, the vectors get shorter as you go farther away from the origin; they always point radially outward. But there is a (a) E (b) E FIGURE 2.12 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 67 nicer way to represent this ﬁeld, and that’s to connect up the arrows, to form ﬁeld lines (Fig. 2.12b). You might think that I have thereby thrown away information about the strength of the ﬁeld, which was contained in the length of the arrows. But actually I have not. The magnitude of the ﬁeld is indicated by the density of the ﬁeld lines: it’s strong near the center where the ﬁeld lines are close together, and weak farther out, where they are relatively far apart. In truth, the ﬁeld-line diagram is deceptive, when I draw it on a two-dimensional surface, for the density of lines passing through a circle of radius r is the total number divided by the circumference (n/2πr ), which goes like (1/r ), not (1/r 2). But if you imagine the model in three dimensions (a pincushion with needles sticking out in all directions), then the density of lines is the total number divided by the area of the sphere (n/4πr 2), which does go like (1/r 2). Such diagrams are also convenient for representing more complicated ﬁelds. Of course, the number of lines you draw depends on how lazy you are (and how sharp your pencil is), though you ought to include enough to get an accurate sense of the ﬁeld, and you must be consistent: If q gets 8 lines, then 2q deserves 16. And you must space them fairly—they emanate from a point charge symmetrically in all directions. Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative ones; they cannot simply terminate in midair, 4 though they may extend out to inﬁnity. Moreover, ﬁeld lines can never cross—at the intersection, the ﬁeld would have two different directions at once! With all this in mind, it is easy to sketch the ﬁeld of any simple conﬁguration of point charges: Begin by drawing the lines in the neighborhood of each charge, and then connect them up or extend them to inﬁnity (Figs. 2.13 and 2.14). In this model, the ﬂux of E through a surface S, \tE ≡ ∫ S E · da, (2.11) + − Opposite charges FIGURE 2.13 4If they did, the divergence of E would not be zero, and (as we shall soon see) that cannot happen in empty space. 68 Chapter 2 Electrostatics ++ Equal charges FIGURE 2.14 is a measure of the “number of ﬁeld lines” passing through S. I put this in quotes because of course we can only draw a representative sample of the ﬁeld lines—the total number would be inﬁnite. But for a given sampling rate the ﬂux is propor- tional to the number of lines drawn, because the ﬁeld strength, remember, is pro- portional to the density of ﬁeld lines (the number per unit area), and hence E · da is proportional to the number of lines passing through the inﬁnitesimal area da. (The dot product picks out the component of da along the direction of E, as indi- cated in Fig. 2.15. It is the area in the plane perpendicular to E that we have in mind when we say that the density of ﬁeld lines is the number per unit area.) This suggests that the ﬂux through any closed surface is a measure of the total charge inside. For the ﬁeld lines that originate on a positive charge must either pass out through the surface or else terminate on a negative charge inside (Fig. 2.16a). On the other hand, a charge outside the surface will contribute nothing to the total ﬂux, since its ﬁeld lines pass in one side and out the other (Fig. 2.16b). This is the essence of Gauss’s law. Now let’s make it quantitative. In the case of a point charge q at the origin, the ﬂux of E through a spherical surface of radius r is ∮ E · da = ∫ 1 4πϵ0 ( q r 2 ˆr) · (r 2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr) = 1 ϵ0 q. (2.12) da E FIGURE 2.15 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 69 (a) 2q q E (b) E q FIGURE 2.16 Notice that the radius of the sphere cancels out, for while the surface area goes up as r 2, the ﬁeld goes down as 1/r 2, so the product is constant. In terms of the ﬁeld-line picture, this makes good sense, since the same number of ﬁeld lines pass through any sphere centered at the origin, regardless of its size. In fact, it didn’t have to be a sphere—any closed surface, whatever its shape, would be pierced by the same number of ﬁeld lines. Evidently the ﬂux through any surface enclosing the charge is q/ϵ0. Now suppose that instead of a single charge at the origin, we have a bunch of charges scattered about. According to the principle of superposition, the total ﬁeld is the (vector) sum of all the individual ﬁelds: E = n∑ i=1 Ei . The ﬂux through a surface that encloses them all is ∮ E · da = n∑ i=1 √∮ Ei · da ) = n∑ i=1 √ 1 ϵ0 qi ) For any closed surface, then, ∮ E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc, (2.13) where Qenc is the total charge enclosed within the surface. This is the quantita- tive statement of Gauss’s law. Although it contains no information that was not already present in Coulomb’s law plus the principle of superposition, it is of al- most magical power, as you will see in Sect. 2.2.3. Notice that it all hinges on the 1/r 2 character of Coulomb’s law; without that the crucial cancellation of the r ’s in Eq. 2.12 would not take place, and the total ﬂux of E would depend on the surface chosen, not merely on the total charge enclosed. Other 1/r 2 forces (I am thinking particularly of Newton’s law of universal gravitation) will obey “Gauss’s laws” of their own, and the applications we develop here carry over directly. 70 Chapter 2 Electrostatics As it stands, Gauss’s law is an integral equation, but we can easily turn it into a differential one, by applying the divergence theorem: ∮ S E · da = ∫ V (∇ · E) dτ. Rewriting Qenc in terms of the charge density ρ,wehave Qenc = ∫ V ρ dτ. So Gauss’s law becomes ∫ V (∇ · E) dτ = ∫ V √ ρ ϵ0 ) dτ. And since this holds for any volume, the integrands must be equal: ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ. (2.14) Equation 2.14 carries the same message as Eq. 2.13; it is Gauss’s law in differen- tial form. The differential version is tidier, but the integral form has the advantage in that it accommodates point, line, and surface charges more naturally. Problem 2.9 Suppose the electric ﬁeld in some region is found to be E = kr 3 ˆr,in spherical coordinates (k is some constant). (a) Find the charge density ρ. (b) Find the total charge contained in a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin. (Doittwo differentways.) Problem 2.10 Acharge q sits at the back corner of a cube, as shown in Fig. 2.17. What is the ﬂux of E through the shaded side? q FIGURE 2.17 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 71 2.2.2 The Divergence of E Let’s go back, now, and calculate the divergence of E directly from Eq. 2.8: E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ all space ˆr r2 ρ(r ˙) dτ ˙. (2.15) (Originally the integration was over the volume occupied by the charge, but I may as well extend it to all space, since ρ = 0 in the exterior region anyway.) Noting that the r-dependence is contained in r = r − r ˙,wehave ∇ · E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ∇ · √ ˆr r2 ) ρ(r ˙) dτ ˙. This is precisely the divergence we calculated in Eq. 1.100: ∇ · √ ˆr r2 ) = 4πδ3(r). Thus ∇ · E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ 4πδ3(r − r ˙)ρ(r ˙) dτ ˙ = 1 ϵ0 ρ(r), (2.16) which is Gauss’s law in differential form (Eq. 2.14). To recover the integral form (Eq. 2.13), we run the previous argument in reverse—integrate over a volume and apply the divergence theorem: ∫ V ∇ · E dτ = ∮ S E · da = 1 ϵ0 ∫ V ρ dτ = 1 ϵ0 Qenc. 2.2.3 Applications of Gauss’sLaw I must interrupt the theoretical development at this point to show you the extraordinary power of Gauss’s law, in integral form. When symmetry permits, it affords by far the quickest and easiest way of computing electric ﬁelds. I’ll illustrate the method with a series of examples. Example 2.3. Find the ﬁeld outside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and total charge q. Solution Imagine a spherical surface at radius r > R (Fig. 2.18); this is called a Gaussian surface in the trade. Gauss’s law says that ∮ S E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc, 72 Chapter 2 Electrostatics and in this case Qenc = q. At ﬁrst glance this doesn’t seem to get us very far, because the quantity we want (E) is buried inside the surface integral. Luckily, symmetry allows us to extract E from under the integral sign: E certainly points radially outward, 5 as does da, so we can drop the dot product, ∫ S E · da = ∫ S |E| da, R r Gaussian surface FIGURE 2.18 and the magnitude of E is constant over the Gaussian surface, so it comes outside the integral: ∫ S |E| da =|E| ∫ S da =|E| 4πr 2. Thus |E| 4πr 2 = 1 ϵ0 q, or E = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 ˆr. Notice a remarkable feature of this result: The ﬁeld outside the sphere is exactly the same as it would have been if all the charge had been concentrated at the center. Gauss’s law is always true, but it is not always useful. If ρ had not been uniform (or, at any rate, not spherically symmetrical), or if I had chosen some other shape for my Gaussian surface, it would still have been true that the ﬂux of E is q/ϵ0,but E would not have pointed in the same direction as da, and its magnitude would not have been constant over the surface, and without that I cannot get |E| outside 5If you doubt that E is radial, consider the alternative. Suppose, say, that it points due east, at the “equator.” But the orientation of the equator is perfectly arbitrary—nothing is spinning here, so there is no natural “north-south” axis—any argument purporting to show that E points east could just as well be used to show it points west, or north, or any other direction. The only unique direction on a sphere is radial. 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 73 Gaussian surface FIGURE 2.19 Gaussian pillbox FIGURE 2.20 of the integral. Symmetry is crucial to this application of Gauss’s law. As far as I know, there are only three kinds of symmetry that work: 1. Spherical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a concentric sphere. 2. Cylindrical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a coaxial cylinder (Fig. 2.19). 3. Plane symmetry. Use a Gaussian “pillbox” that straddles the surface (Fig. 2.20). Although (2) and (3) technically require inﬁnitely long cylinders, and planes ex- tending to inﬁnity, we shall often use them to get approximate answers for “long” cylinders or “large” planes, at points far from the edges. Example 2.4. A long cylinder (Fig. 2.21) carries a charge density that is propor- tional to the distance from the axis: ρ = ks, for some constant k. Find the electric ﬁeld inside this cylinder. Solution Draw a Gaussian cylinder of length l and radius s. For this surface, Gauss’s law states: ∮ S E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc. The enclosed charge is Qenc = ∫ ρ dτ = ∫ (ks˙)(s˙ ds˙ dφ dz) = 2π kl ∫ s 0 s˙2 ds˙ = 2 3 π kls3. E s Gaussian surface l E FIGURE 2.21 74 Chapter 2 Electrostatics (I used the volume element appropriate to cylindrical coordinates, Eq. 1.78, and integrated φ from 0 to 2π , dz from 0 to l. I put a prime on the integration variable s˙, to distinguish it from the radius s of the Gaussian surface.) Now, symmetry dictates that E must point radially outward, so for the curved portion of the Gaussian cylinder we have: ∫ E · da = ∫ |E| da =|E| ∫ da =|E| 2π sl, while the two ends contribute nothing (here E is perpendicular to da). Thus, |E| 2πsl = 1 ϵ0 2 3 π kls3, or, ﬁnally, E = 1 3ϵ0 ks2ˆs. Example 2.5. An inﬁnite plane carries a uniform surface charge σ . Find its electric ﬁeld. Solution Draw a “Gaussian pillbox,” extending equal distances above and below the plane (Fig. 2.22). Apply Gauss’s law to this surface: ∮ E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc. In this case, Qenc = σ A, where A is the area of the lid of the pillbox. By symme- try, E points away from the plane (upward for points above, downward for points below). So the top and bottom surfaces yield ∫ E · da = 2A|E|, whereas the sides contribute nothing. Thus 2A |E|= 1 ϵ0 σ A, E E A FIGURE 2.22 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 75 or E = σ 2ϵ0 ˆn, (2.17) where ˆn is a unit vector pointing away from the surface. In Prob. 2.6, you obtained this same result by a much more laborious method. It seems surprising, at ﬁrst, that the ﬁeld of an inﬁnite plane is independent of how far away you are. What about the 1/r 2 in Coulomb’s law? The point is that as you move farther and farther away from the plane, more and more charge comes into your “ﬁeld of view” (a cone shape extending out from your eye), and this compensates for the diminishing inﬂuence of any particular piece. The electric ﬁeld of a sphere falls off like 1/r 2; the electric ﬁeld of an inﬁnite line falls off like 1/r ; and the electric ﬁeld of an inﬁnite plane does not fall off at all (you cannot escape from an inﬁnite plane). Although the direct use of Gauss’s law to compute electric ﬁelds is limited to cases of spherical, cylindrical, and planar symmetry, we can put together combi- nations of objects possessing such symmetry, even though the arrangement as a whole is not symmetrical. For example, invoking the principle of superposition, we could ﬁnd the ﬁeld in the vicinity of two uniformly charged parallel cylinders, or a sphere near an inﬁnite charged plane. Example 2.6. Two inﬁnite parallel planes carry equal but opposite uniform charge densities ±σ (Fig. 2.23). Find the ﬁeld in each of the three regions: (i) to the left of both, (ii) between them, (iii) to the right of both. Solution The left plate produces a ﬁeld (1/2ϵ0)σ , which points away from it (Fig. 2.24)— to the left in region (i) and to the right in regions (ii) and (iii). The right plate, being negatively charged, produces a ﬁeld (1/2ϵ0)σ , which points toward it—to the right in regions (i) and (ii) and to the left in region (iii). The two ﬁelds cancel in regions (i) and (iii); they conspire in region (ii). Conclusion: The ﬁeld between the plates is σ/ϵ0, and points to the right; elsewhere it is zero.

Problem 2.13 Find the electric ﬁeld a distance s from an inﬁnitely long straight wire that carries a uniform line charge λ. Compare Eq. 2.9. Problem 2.14 Find the electric ﬁeld inside a sphere that carries a charge density pro- portional to the distance from the origin, ρ = kr , for some constant k.[Hint: This charge density is not uniform, and you must integrate to get the enclosed charge.] Problem 2.15 A thick spherical shell carries charge density ρ = k r 2 (a ≤ r ≤ b) (Fig. 2.25). Find the electric ﬁeld in the three regions: (i) r < a, (ii) a < r < b, (iii) r > b. Plot |E| as a function of r , for the case b = 2a. Problem 2.16 A long coaxial cable (Fig. 2.26) carries a uniform volume charge density ρ on the inner cylinder (radius a), and a uniform surface charge density on the outer cylindrical shell (radius b). This surface charge is negative and is of just the right magnitude that the cable as a whole is electrically neutral. Find the electric ﬁeld in each of the three regions: (i) inside the inner cylinder (s < a), (ii) between the cylinders (a < s < b), (iii) outside the cable (s > b).

In this case E = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 ˆr. Now, a glance at Fig. 2.12 should convince you that the curl of this ﬁeld has to be zero, but I suppose we ought to come up with something a little more rigorous than that. What if we calculate the line integral of this ﬁeld from some point a to some other point b (Fig. 2.29): ∫ b a E · dl. In spherical coordinates, dl = dr ˆr + rdθ ˆθ + r sin θ dφ ˆφ,so E · dl = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 dr. z x q rb ra y b a FIGURE 2.29 78 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Therefore, ∫ b a E · dl = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ b a q r 2 dr = −1 4πϵ0 q r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ rb ra = 1 4πϵ0 √ q ra − q rb ) , (2.18) where ra is the distance from the origin to the point a and rb is the distance to b. The integral around a closed path is evidently zero (for then ra = rb): ∮ E · dl = 0, (2.19) and hence, applying Stokes’ theorem, ∇ × E = 0. (2.20) Now, I proved Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 only for the ﬁeld of a single point charge at the origin, but these results make no reference to what is, after all, a perfectly arbitrary choice of coordinates; they hold no matter where the charge is located. Moreover, if we have many charges, the principle of superposition states that the total ﬁeld is a vector sum of their individual ﬁelds: E = E1 + E2 + ..., so ∇ × E = ∇ × (E1 + E2 + ...) = (∇ × E1) + (∇ × E2) + ... = 0. Thus, Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 hold for any static charge distribution whatever. Problem 2.19 Calculate ∇ × E directly from Eq. 2.8, by the method of Sect. 2.2.2. Refer to Prob. 1.63 if you get stuck. 2.3 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 2.3.1 Introduction to Potential The electric ﬁeld E is not just any old vector function. It is a very special kind of vector function: one whose curl is zero. E = y ˆx, for example, could not possibly be an electrostatic ﬁeld; no set of charges, regardless of their sizes and positions, could ever produce such a ﬁeld. We’re going to exploit this special property of electric ﬁelds to reduce a vector problem (ﬁnding E) to a much simpler scalar problem. The ﬁrst theorem in Sect. 1.6.2 asserts that any vector whose curl is zero is equal to the gradient of some scalar. What I’m going to do now amounts to a proof of that claim, in the context of electrostatics. 2.3 Electric Potential 79 b a (i) (ii) FIGURE 2.30 Because ∇ × E = 0, the line integral of E around any closed loop is zero (that follows from Stokes’ theorem). Because ∮ E · dl = 0, the line integral of E from point a to point b is the same for all paths (otherwise you could go out along path (i) and return along path (ii)—Fig. 2.30—and obtain ∮ E · dl ⃝= 0). Because the line integral is independent of path, we can deﬁne a function6 V (r) ≡− ∫ r O E · dl. (2.21) Here O is some standard reference point on which we have agreed beforehand; V then depends only on the point r. It is called the electric potential. The potential difference between two points a and b is V (b) − V (a) =− ∫ b O E · dl + ∫ a O E · dl =− ∫ b O E · dl − ∫ O a E · dl =− ∫ b a E · dl. (2.22) Now, the fundamental theorem for gradients states that V (b) − V (a) = ∫ b a (∇V ) · dl, so ∫ b a (∇V ) · dl =− ∫ b a E · dl. Since, ﬁnally, this is true for any points a and b, the integrands must be equal: E =−∇V. (2.23) 6To avoid any possible ambiguity, I should perhaps put a prime on the integration variable: V (r) =− ∫ r O E(r ˙) · dl ˙. But this makes for cumbersome notation, and I prefer whenever possible to reserve the primes for source points. However, when (as in Ex. 2.7) we calculate such integrals explicitly, I will put in the primes. 80 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Equation 2.23 is the differential version of Eq. 2.21; it says that the electric ﬁeld is the gradient of a scalar potential, which is what we set out to prove. Notice the subtle but crucial role played by path independence (or, equiva- lently, the fact that ∇ × E = 0) in this argument. If the line integral of E depended on the path taken, then the “deﬁnition” of V , Eq. 2.21, would be nonsense. It sim- ply would not deﬁne a function, since changing the path would alter the value of V (r). By the way, don’t let the minus sign in Eq. 2.23 distract you; it carries over from Eq. 2.21 and is largely a matter of convention. Problem 2.20 One of these is an impossible electrostatic ﬁeld. Which one? (a) E = k[xy ˆx + 2yz ˆy + 3xz ˆz]; (b) E = k[y2 ˆx + (2xy + z2) ˆy + 2yz ˆz]. Here k is a constant with the appropriate units. For the possible one, ﬁnd the poten- tial, using the origin as your reference point. Check your answer by computing ∇V . [Hint: You must select a speciﬁc path to integrate along. It doesn’t matter what path you choose, since the answer is path-independent, but you simply cannot integrate unless you have a deﬁnite path in mind.] 2.3.2 Comments on Potential (i) The name. The word “potential” is a hideous misnomer because it inevitably reminds you of potential energy. This is particularly insidious, because there is a connection between “potential” and “potential energy,” as you will see in Sect. 2.4. I’m sorry that it is impossible to escape this word. The best I can do is to insist once and for all that “potential” and “potential energy” are completely different terms and should, by all rights, have different names. Incidentally, a sur- face over which the potential is constant is called an equipotential. (ii) Advantage of the potential formulation. If you know V , you can eas- ily get E—just take the gradient: E =−∇V . This is quite extraordinary when you stop to think about it, for E is a vector quantity (three components), but V is a scalar (one component). How can one function possibly contain all the in- formation that three independent functions carry? The answer is that the three components of E are not really as independent as they look; in fact, they are ex- plicitly interrelated by the very condition we started with, ∇ × E = 0. In terms of components, ∂ Ex ∂ y = ∂ E y ∂ x , ∂ Ez ∂ y = ∂ E y ∂z , ∂ Ex ∂z = ∂ Ez ∂ x . This brings us back to my observation at the beginning of Sect. 2.3.1: E is a very special kind of vector. What the potential formulation does is to exploit this feature to maximum advantage, reducing a vector problem to a scalar one, in which there is no need to fuss with components. 2.3 Electric Potential 81 (iii) The reference point O. There is an essential ambiguity in the deﬁnition of potential, since the choice of reference point O was arbitrary. Changing reference points amounts to adding a constant K to the potential: V ˙(r) =− ∫ r O˙ E · dl =− ∫ O O˙ E · dl − ∫ r O E · dl = K + V (r), where K is the line integral of E from the old reference point O to the new one O˙. Of course, adding a constant to V will not affect the potential difference between two points: V ˙(b) − V ˙(a) = V (b) − V (a), since the K ’s cancel out. (Actually, it was already clear from Eq. 2.22 that the potential difference is independent of O, because it can be written as the line integral of E from a to b, with no reference to O.) Nor does the ambiguity affect the gradient of V : ∇V ˙ = ∇V, since the derivative of a constant is zero. That’s why all such V ’s, differing only in their choice of reference point, correspond to the same ﬁeld E. Potential as such carries no real physical signiﬁcance, for at any given point we can adjust its value at will by a suitable relocation of O. In this sense, it is rather like altitude: If I ask you how high Denver is, you will probably tell me its height above sea level, because that is a convenient and traditional reference point. But we could as well agree to measure altitude above Washington, D.C., or Greenwich, or wherever. That would add (or, rather, subtract) a ﬁxed amount from all our sea-level readings, but it wouldn’t change anything about the real world. The only quantity of intrinsic interest is the difference in altitude between two points, and that is the same whatever your reference level. Having said this, however, there is a “natural” spot to use for O in electrostatics—analogous to sea level for altitude—and that is a point inﬁnitely far from the charge. Ordinarily, then, we “set the zero of potential at inﬁnity.” (Since V (O) = 0, choosing a reference point is equivalent to selecting a place where V is to be zero.) But I must warn you that there is one special circum- stance in which this convention fails: when the charge distribution itself extends to inﬁnity. The symptom of trouble, in such cases, is that the potential blows up. For instance, the ﬁeld of a uniformly charged plane is (σ/2ϵ0) ˆn, as we found in Ex. 2.5; if we naïvely put O =∞, then the potential at height z above the plane becomes V (z) =− ∫ z ∞ 1 2ϵ0 σ dz =− 1 2ϵ0 σ(z −∞). The remedy is simply to choose some other reference point (in this example you might use a point on the plane). Notice that the difﬁculty occurs only in textbook problems; in “real life” there is no such thing as a charge distribution that goes on forever, and we can always use inﬁnity as our reference point. 82 Chapter 2 Electrostatics (iv) Potential obeys the superposition principle. The original superposition principle pertains to the force on a test charge Q. It says that the total force on Q is the vector sum of the forces attributable to the source charges individually: F = F1 + F2 + ... Dividing through by Q, we see that the electric ﬁeld, too, obeys the superposition principle: E = E1 + E2 + ... Integrating from the common reference point to r, it follows that the potential also satisﬁes such a principle: V = V1 + V2 + ... That is, the potential at any given point is the sum of the potentials due to all the source charges separately. Only this time it is an ordinary sum, not a vector sum, which makes it a lot easier to work with. (v) Units of Potential. In our units, force is measured in newtons and charge in coulombs, so electric ﬁelds are in newtons per coulomb. Accordingly, potential is newton-meters per coulomb, or joules per coulomb. A joule per coulomb is a volt. Example 2.7. Find the potential inside and outside a spherical shell of radius R (Fig. 2.31) that carries a uniform surface charge. Set the reference point at inﬁnity. R Pr FIGURE 2.31 Solution From Gauss’s law, the ﬁeld outside is E = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 ˆr, where q is the total charge on the sphere. The ﬁeld inside is zero. For points outside the sphere (r > R), V (r ) =− ∫ r O E · dl = −1 4πϵ0 ∫ r ∞ q r ˙2 dr ˙ = 1 4πϵ0 q r ˙ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r ∞ = 1 4πϵ0 q r . 2.3 Electric Potential 83 To ﬁnd the potential inside the sphere (r < R), we must break the integral into two pieces, using in each region the ﬁeld that prevails there: V (r ) = −1 4πϵ0 ∫ R ∞ q r ˙2 dr ˙ − ∫ r R (0) dr ˙ = 1 4πϵ0 q r ˙ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ R ∞ + 0 = 1 4πϵ0 q R . Notice that the potential is not zero inside the shell, even though the ﬁeld is. V is a constant in this region, to be sure, so that ∇V = 0—that’s what matters. In problems of this type, you must always work your way in from the reference point; that’s where the potential is “nailed down.” It is tempting to suppose that you could ﬁgure out the potential inside the sphere on the basis of the ﬁeld there alone, but this is false: The potential inside the sphere is sensitive to what’s going on outside the sphere as well. If I placed a second uniformly charged shell out at radius R˙ > R, the potential inside R would change, even though the ﬁeld would still be zero. Gauss’s law guarantees that charge exterior to a given point (that is, at larger r ) produces no net ﬁeld at that point, provided it is spherically or cylindrically symmetric, but there is no such rule for potential, when inﬁnity is used as the reference point. Problem 2.21 Find the potential inside and outside a uniformly charged solid sphere whose radius is R and whose total charge is q. Use inﬁnity as your reference point. Compute the gradient of V in each region, and check that it yields the correct ﬁeld. Sketch V (r ). Problem 2.22 Find the potential a distance s from an inﬁnitely long straight wire that carries a uniform line charge λ. Compute the gradient of your potential, and check that it yields the correct ﬁeld. Problem 2.23 For the charge conﬁguration of Prob. 2.15, ﬁnd the potential at the center, using inﬁnity as your reference point. Problem 2.24 For the conﬁguration of Prob. 2.16, ﬁnd the potential difference between a point on the axis and a point on the outer cylinder. Note that it is not necessary to commit yourself to a particular reference point, if you use Eq. 2.22. 2.3.3 Poisson’s Equation and Laplace’s Equation We found in Sect. 2.3.1 that the electric ﬁeld can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential. E =−∇V. The question arises: What do the divergence and curl of E, ∇ · E = ρ ϵ0 and ∇ × E = 0, 84 Chapter 2 Electrostatics look like, in terms of V ? Well, ∇ · E = ∇ · (−∇V ) =−∇2V , so, apart from that persistent minus sign, the divergence of E is the Laplacian of V . Gauss’s law, then, says ∇2V =− ρ ϵ0 . (2.24) This is known as Poisson’s equation. In regions where there is no charge, so ρ = 0, Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation, ∇2V = 0. (2.25) We’ll explore this equation more fully in Chapter 3. So much for Gauss’s law. What about the curl law? This says that ∇ × E = ∇ × (−∇V ) = 0. But that’s no condition on V —curl of gradient is always zero. Of course, we used the curl law to show that E could be expressed as the gradient of a scalar, so it’s not really surprising that this works out: ∇ × E = 0 permits E =−∇V ; in return, E =−∇V guarantees ∇ × E = 0. It takes only one differential equa- tion (Poisson’s) to determine V , because V is a scalar; for E we needed two, the divergence and the curl. 2.3.4 The Potential of a Localized Charge Distribution I deﬁned V in terms of E (Eq. 2.21). Ordinarily, though, it’s E that we’re looking for (if we already knew E, there wouldn’t be much point in calculating V ). The idea is that it might be easier to get V ﬁrst, and then calculate E by taking the gradient. Typically, then, we know where the charge is (that is, we know ρ), and we want to ﬁnd V . Now, Poisson’s equation relates V and ρ, but unfortunately it’s “the wrong way around”: it would give us ρ, if we knew V , whereas we want V , knowing ρ. What we must do, then, is “invert” Poisson’s equation. That’s the program for this section, although I shall do it by roundabout means, beginning, as always, with a point charge at the origin. The electric ﬁeld is E = (1/4πϵ0)(1/r 2) ˆr, and dl = dr ˆr + rdθ ˆθ + r sin θ dφ ˆφ (Eq. 1.68), so E · dl = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 dr. Setting the reference point at inﬁnity, the potential of a point charge q at the origin is V (r ) =− ∫ r O E · dl = −1 4πϵ0 ∫ r ∞ q r ˙2 dr ˙ = 1 4πϵ0 q r ˙ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r ∞ = 1 4πϵ0 q r . (You see here the advantage of using inﬁnity for the reference point: it kills the lower limit on the integral.) Notice the sign of V ; presumably the conventional 2.3 Electric Potential 85 P r i q q1 q2 P qi P dτ r r FIGURE 2.32 minus sign in the deﬁnition (Eq. 2.21) was chosen in order to make the poten- tial of a positive charge come out positive. It is useful to remember that regions of positive charge are potential “hills,” regions of negative charge are potential “valleys,” and the electric ﬁeld points “downhill,” from plus toward minus. In general, the potential of a point charge q is V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 q r , (2.26) where r, as always, is the distance from q to r (Fig. 2.32). Invoking the superpo- sition principle, then, the potential of a collection of charges is V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 n∑ i=1 qi ri , (2.27) or, for a continuous distribution, V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ 1 r dq. (2.28) In particular, for a volume charge, it’s V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r ˙) r dτ ˙. (2.29) This is the equation we were looking for, telling us how to compute V when we know ρ; it is, if you like, the “solution” to Poisson’s equation, for a localized charge distribution.7 Compare Eq. 2.29 with the corresponding formula for the electric ﬁeld in terms of ρ (Eq. 2.8): E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r ˙) r2 ˆr dτ ˙. The main point to notice is that the pesky unit vector ˆr is gone, so there is no need to fuss with components. The potentials of line and surface charges are V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ λ(r ˙) r dl ˙ and V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ σ(r ˙) r da˙. (2.30) I should warn you that everything in this section is predicated on the assump- tion that the reference point is at inﬁnity. This is hardly apparent in Eq. 2.29, but 7Equation 2.29 is an example of the Helmholtz theorem (Appendix B). 86 Chapter 2 Electrostatics remember that we got that equation from the potential of a point charge at the ori- gin, (1/4πϵ0)(q/r ), which is valid only when O =∞. If you try to apply these formulas to one of those artiﬁcial problems in which the charge itself extends to inﬁnity, the integral will diverge. Example 2.8. Find the potential of a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius R (Fig. 2.33). Solution This is the same problem we solved in Ex. 2.7, but this time let’s do it using Eq. 2.30: V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ σ r da˙. We might as well set the point P on the z axis and use the law of cosines to express r: r2 = R2 + z2 − 2Rz cos θ ˙. x z y z P R θ′ r FIGURE 2.33 An element of surface area on the sphere is R2 sin θ ˙ dθ ˙ dφ˙,so 4πϵ0V (z) = σ ∫ R2 sin θ ˙ dθ ˙ dφ˙ √R2 + z2 − 2Rz cos θ ˙ = 2π R2σ ∫ π 0 sin θ ˙ √R2 + z2 − 2Rz cos θ ˙ dθ ˙ = 2π R2σ √ 1 Rz √R2 + z2 − 2Rz cos θ ˙)∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ π 0 = 2π Rσ z (√R2 + z2 + 2Rz − √R2 + z2 − 2Rz ) = 2π Rσ z [√(R + z)2 − √ (R − z)2] . 2.3 Electric Potential 87 At this stage, we must be very careful to take the positive root. For points outside the sphere, z is greater than R, and hence √ (R − z)2 = z − R; for points inside the sphere, √(R − z)2 = R − z. Thus, V (z) = Rσ 2ϵ0z [(R + z) − (z − R)]= R2σ ϵ0z , outside; V (z) = Rσ 2ϵ0z [(R + z) − (R − z)]= Rσ ϵ0 ,inside. In terms of r and the total charge on the shell, q = 4π R2σ , V (r ) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ 1 4πϵ0 q r (r ≥ R), 1 4πϵ0 q R (r ≤ R). Of course, in this particular case, it was easier to get V by using Eq. 2.21 than Eq. 2.30, because Gauss’s law gave us E with so little effort. But if you compare Ex. 2.8 with Prob. 2.7, you will appreciate the power of the potential formulation. Problem 2.25 Using Eqs. 2.27 and 2.30, ﬁnd the potential at a distance z above the center of the charge distributions in Fig. 2.34. In each case, compute E =−∇V ,and compare your answers with Ex. 2.1, Ex. 2.2, and Prob. 2.6, respectively. Suppose that we changed the right-hand charge in Fig. 2.34a to −q; what then is the potential at P? What ﬁeld does that suggest? Compare your answer to Prob. 2.2, and explain carefully any discrepancy. z P +q +qd (a) Two point charges z P 2L (b) Uniform line charge λ P z (c) Uniform surface charge Rσ FIGURE 2.34 Problem 2.26 A conical surface (an empty ice-cream cone) carries a uniform sur- face charge σ . The height of the cone is h, as is the radius of the top. Find the potential difference between points a (the vertex) and b (the center of the top). Problem 2.27 Find the potential on the axis of a uniformly charged solid cylinder, a distance z from the center. The length of the cylinder is L, its radius is R,and the charge density is ρ. Use your result to calculate the electric ﬁeld at this point. (Assume that z > L/2.) 88 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Problem 2.28 Use Eq. 2.29 to calculate the potential inside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and total charge q. Compare your answer to Prob. 2.21. Problem 2.29 Check that Eq. 2.29 satisﬁes Poisson’s equation, by applying the Laplacian and using Eq. 1.102. 2.3.5 Boundary Conditions In the typical electrostatic problem you are given a source charge distribution ρ, and you want to ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld E it produces. Unless the symmetry of the problem allows a solution by Gauss’s law, it is generally to your advan- tage to calculate the potential ﬁrst, as an intermediate step. These are the three fundamental quantities of electrostatics: ρ, E, and V . We have, in the course of our discussion, derived all six formulas interrelating them. These equations are neatly summarized in Fig. 2.35. We began with just two experimental obser- vations: (1) the principle of superposition—a broad general rule applying to all electromagnetic forces, and (2) Coulomb’s law—the fundamental law of electro- statics. From these, all else followed. You may have noticed, in studying Exs. 2.5 and 2.6, or working problems such as 2.7, 2.11, and 2.16, that the electric ﬁeld always undergoes a discontinuity when you cross a surface charge σ . In fact, it is a simple matter to ﬁnd the amount by which E changes at such a boundary. Suppose we draw a wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox, extending just barely over the edge in each direction (Fig. 2.36). Gauss’s law says that ∮ S E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc = 1 ϵ0 σ A, where A is the area of the pillbox lid. (If σ varies from point to point or the surface is curved, we must pick A to be extremely small.) Now, the sides of the pillbox ρ EVE =ρdτ14πε0r2r∇.E = ρ/ε0 ;∇ × E = 0 V = − E.dlV =dτ14πε0rρ∇2V = −ρ/ε0 E = −∇V FIGURE 2.35 2.3 Electric Potential 89 \u0003 E⊥ E⊥ below above σ A FIGURE 2.36 contribute nothing to the ﬂux, in the limit as the thickness ϵ goes to zero, so we are left with E ⊥ above − E ⊥ below = 1 ϵ0 σ, (2.31) where E ⊥ above denotes the component of E that is perpendicular to the surface im- mediately above, and E ⊥ below is the same, only just below the surface. For consis- tency, we let “upward” be the positive direction for both. Conclusion: The normal component of E is discontinuous by an amount σ/ϵ0 at any boundary. In partic- ular, where there is no surface charge, E ⊥ is continuous, as for instance at the surface of a uniformly charged solid sphere. The tangential component of E, by contrast, is always continuous. For if we apply Eq. 2.19, ∮ E · dl = 0, to the thin rectangular loop of Fig. 2.37, the ends give nothing (as ϵ → 0), and the sides give (E ∥ abovel − E ∥ belowl),so E ∥ above = E ∥ below, (2.32) where E ∥ stands for the components of E parallel to the surface. The boundary conditions on E (Eqs. 2.31 and 2.32) can be combined into a single formula: Eabove − Ebelow = σ ϵ0 ˆn, (2.33) E \u0002 below E \u0002 above lσ \u0003 FIGURE 2.37 90 Chapter 2 Electrostatics b a σ FIGURE 2.38 where ˆn is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing from “below” to “above.” 8 The potential, meanwhile, is continuous across any boundary (Fig. 2.38), since Vabove − Vbelow =− ∫ b a E · dl; as the path length shrinks to zero, so too does the integral: Vabove = Vbelow. (2.34) However, the gradient of V inherits the discontinuity in E; since E =−∇V , Eq. 2.33 implies that ∇Vabove − ∇Vbelow =− 1 ϵ0 σ ˆn, (2.35) or, more conveniently, ∂ Vabove ∂n − ∂ Vbelow ∂n =− 1 ϵ0 σ, (2.36) where ∂ V ∂n = ∇V · ˆn (2.37) denotes the normal derivative of V (that is, the rate of change in the direction perpendicular to the surface). Please note that these boundary conditions relate the ﬁelds and potentials just above and just below the surface. For example, the derivatives in Eq. 2.36 are the limiting values as we approach the surface from either side. 8Notice that it doesn’t matter which side you call “above” and which “below,” since reversal would switch the direction of ˆn. Incidentally, if you’re only interested in the ﬁeld due to the (essentially ﬂat) local patch of surface charge itself, the answer is (σ/2ϵ0) ˆn immediately above the surface, and −(σ/2ϵ0) ˆn immediately below. This follows from Ex. 2.5, for if you are close enough to the patch it “looks” like an inﬁnite plane. Evidently the entire discontinuity in E is attributable to this local patch of surface charge. 2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics 91 Problem 2.30 (a) Check that the results of Exs. 2.5 and 2.6, and Prob. 2.11, are consistent with Eq. 2.33. (b) Use Gauss’s law to ﬁnd the ﬁeld inside and outside a long hollow cylindrical tube, which carries a uniform surface charge σ . Check that your result is con- sistent with Eq. 2.33. (c) Check that the result of Ex. 2.8 is consistent with boundary conditions 2.34 and 2.36. 2.4 WORK AND ENERGY IN ELECTROSTATICS 2.4.1 The Work It Takes to Move a Charge Suppose you have a stationary conﬁguration of source charges, and you want to move a test charge Q from point a to point b (Fig. 2.39). Question: How much work will you have to do? At any point along the path, the electric force on Q is F = QE;the force you must exert, in opposition to this electrical force, is −QE. (If the sign bothers you, think about lifting a brick: gravity exerts a force mg downward, but you exert a force mg upward. Of course, you could apply an even greater force—then the brick would accelerate, and part of your effort would be “wasted” generating kinetic energy. What we’re interested in here is the minimum force you must exert to do the job.) The work you do is therefore W = ∫ b a F · dl =−Q ∫ b a E · dl = Q[V (b) − V (a)]. Notice that the answer is independent of the path you take from a to b; in mechan- ics, then, we would call the electrostatic force “conservative.” Dividing through by Q,wehave V (b) − V (a) = W Q . (2.38) In words, the potential difference between points a and b is equal to the work per unit charge required to carry a particle from a to b. In particular, if you want to bring Q in from far away and stick it at point r, the work you must do is W = Q[V (r) − V (∞)], q1 q2 qi a b Q FIGURE 2.39 92 Chapter 2 Electrostatics so, if you have set the reference point at inﬁnity, W = QV (r). (2.39) In this sense, potential is potential energy (the work it takes to create the system) per unit charge (just as the ﬁeld is the force per unit charge). 2.4.2 The Energy of a Point Charge Distribution How much work would it take to assemble an entire collection of point charges? Imagine bringing in the charges, one by one, from far away (Fig. 2.40). The ﬁrst charge, q1, takes no work, since there is no ﬁeld yet to ﬁght against. Now bring in q2. According to Eq. 2.39, this will cost you q2V1(r2), where V1 is the potential due to q1, and r2 is the place we’re putting q2: W2 = 1 4πϵ0 q2 √ q1 r12 ) (r12 is the distance between q1 and q2 once they are in position). As you bring in each charge, nail it down in its ﬁnal location, so it doesn’t move when you bring in the next charge. Now bring in q3; this requires work q3V1,2(r3), where V1,2 is the potential due to charges q1 and q2, namely, (1/4πϵ0)(q1/r13 + q2/r23). Thus W3 = 1 4πϵ0 q3 √ q1 r13 + q2 r23 ) . Similarly, the extra work to bring in q4 will be W4 = 1 4πϵ0 q4 √ q1 r14 + q2 r24 + q3 r34 ) . The total work necessary to assemble the ﬁrst four charges, then, is W = 1 4πϵ0 √ q1q2 r12 + q1q3 r13 + q1q4 r14 + q2q3 r23 + q2q4 r24 + q3q4 r34 ) . q3 r3 r2 r1q1 q2 r13 r23 r12 FIGURE 2.40 2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics 93 You see the general rule: Take the product of each pair of charges, divide by their separation distance, and add it all up: W = 1 4πϵ0 n∑ i=1 n∑ j>i qi q j rij . (2.40) The stipulation j > i is to remind you not to count the same pair twice. A nicer way to accomplish this is intentionally to count each pair twice, and then divide by 2: W = 1 8πϵ0 n∑ i=1 n∑ j⃝=i qi q j rij (2.41) (we must still avoid i = j, of course). Notice that in this form the answer plainly does not depend on the order in which you assemble the charges, since every pair occurs in the sum. Finally, let’s pull out the factor qi : W = 1 2 n∑ i=1 qi ⎛ ⎝ n∑ j⃝=i 1 4πϵ0 q j rij ⎞ ⎠ . The term in parentheses is the potential at point ri (the position of qi ) due to all the other charges—all of them, now, not just the ones that were present at some stage during the assembly. Thus, W = 1 2 n∑ i=1 qi V (ri ). (2.42) That’s how much work it takes to assemble a conﬁguration of point charges; it’s also the amount of work you’d get back if you dismantled the system. In the meantime, it represents energy stored in the conﬁguration (“potential” energy, if you insist, though for obvious reasons I prefer to avoid that word in this context). Problem 2.31 (a) Three charges are situated at the corners of a square (side a), as shown in Fig. 2.41. How much work does it take to bring in another charge, +q, from far away and place it in the fourth corner? (b) How much work does it take to assemble the whole conﬁguration of four charges? −q +q a a −q FIGURE 2.41 94 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Problem 2.32 Two positive point charges, q A and qB (masses m A and m B)are at rest, held together by a massless string of length a. Now the string is cut, and the particles ﬂy off in opposite directions. How fast is each one going, when they are far apart? Problem 2.33 Consider an inﬁnite chain of point charges, ±q (with alternating signs), strung out along the x axis, each a distance a from its nearest neighbors. Find the work per particle required to assemble this system. [Partial Answer: −αq 2/(4πϵ0a), for some dimensionless number α; your problem is to determine α. It is known as the Madelung constant. Calculating the Madelung constant for 2- and 3-dimensional arrays is much more subtle and difﬁcult.] 2.4.3 The Energy of a Continuous Charge Distribution For a volume charge density ρ, Eq. 2.42 becomes W = 1 2 ∫ ρVdτ. (2.43) (The corresponding integrals for line and surface charges would be ∫ λVdl and∫ σ Vda.) There is a lovely way to rewrite this result, in which ρ and V are eliminated in favor of E. First use Gauss’s law to express ρ in terms of E: ρ = ϵ0∇ · E, so W = ϵ0 2 ∫ (∇ · E)Vdτ. Now use integration by parts (Eq. 1.59) to transfer the derivative from E to V : W = ϵ0 2 [− ∫ E · (∇V ) dτ + ∮ V E · da ] . But ∇V =−E,so W = ϵ0 2 ⎛ ⎝ ∫ V E 2 dτ + ∮ S V E · da ⎞ ⎠ . (2.44) But what volume is this we’re integrating over? Let’s go back to the formula we started with, Eq. 2.43. From its derivation, it is clear that we should integrate over the region where the charge is located. But actually, any larger volume would do just as well: The “extra” territory we throw in will contribute nothing to the integral, since ρ = 0 out there. With this in mind, we return to Eq. 2.44. What happens here, as we enlarge the volume beyond the minimum necessary to trap all the charge? Well, the integral of E 2 can only increase (the integrand being positive); evidently the surface integral must decrease correspondingly to leave the sum intact. (In fact, at large distances from the charge, E goes like 1/r 2 and V like 1/r , while the surface area grows like r 2; roughly speaking, then, the surface integral goes down like 1/r .) Please understand: Eq. 2.44 gives you the correct 2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics 95 energy W , whatever volume you use (as long as it encloses all the charge), but the contribution from the volume integral goes up, and that of the surface integral goes down, as you take larger and larger volumes. In particular, why not integrate over all space? Then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with W = ϵ0 2 ∫ E 2 dτ (all space). (2.45) Example 2.9. Find the energy of a uniformly charged spherical shell of total charge q and radius R. Solution 1 Use Eq. 2.43, in the version appropriate to surface charges: W = 1 2 ∫ σ Vda. Now, the potential at the surface of this sphere is (1/4πϵ0)q/R (a constant— Ex. 2.7), so W = 1 8πϵ0 q R ∫ σ da = 1 8πϵ0 q 2 R . Solution 2 Use Eq. 2.45. Inside the sphere, E = 0; outside, E = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 ˆr, so E 2 = q 2 (4πϵ0)2r 4 . Therefore, Wtot = ϵ0 2(4πϵ0)2 ∫ outside √ q 2 r 4 ) (r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ) = 1 32π 2ϵ0 q 24π ∫ ∞ R 1 r 2 dr = 1 8πϵ0 q 2 R . Problem 2.34 Find the energy stored in a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and charge q. Do it three different ways: (a) Use Eq. 2.43. You found the potential in Prob. 2.21. (b) Use Eq. 2.45. Don’t forget to integrate over all space. (c) Use Eq. 2.44. Take a spherical volume of radius a. What happens as a →∞? 96 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Problem 2.35 Here is a fourth way of computing the energy of a uniformly charged solid sphere: Assemble it like a snowball, layer by layer, each time bringing in an inﬁnitesimal charge dq from far away and smearing it uniformly over the surface, thereby increasing the radius. How much work dW does it take to build up the radius by an amount dr ? Integrate this to ﬁnd the work necessary to create the entire sphere of radius R and total charge q. 2.4.4 Comments on Electrostatic Energy (i) A perplexing “inconsistency.” Equation 2.45 clearly implies that the energy of a stationary charge distribution is always positive. On the other hand, Eq. 2.42 (from which 2.45 was in fact derived), can be positive or negative. For instance, according to Eq. 2.42, the energy of two equal but opposite charges a distance r apart is −(1/4πϵ0)(q 2/r). What’s gone wrong? Which equation is cor- rect? The answer is that both are correct, but they speak to slightly different ques- tions. Equation 2.42 does not take into account the work necessary to make the point charges in the ﬁrst place; we started with point charges and simply found the work required to bring them together. This is wise strategy, since Eq. 2.45 indicates that the energy of a point charge is in fact inﬁnite: W = ϵ0 2(4πϵ0)2 ∫ √ q 2 r 4 ) (r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ) = q 2 8πϵ0 ∫ ∞ 0 1 r 2 dr =∞. Equation 2.45 is more complete, in the sense that it tells you the total energy stored in a charge conﬁguration, but Eq. 2.42 is more appropriate when you’re dealing with point charges, because we prefer (for good reason!) to leave out that portion of the total energy that is attributable to the fabrication of the point charges themselves. In practice, after all, the point charges (electrons, say) are given to us ready-made; all we do is move them around. Since we did not put them together, and we cannot take them apart, it is immaterial how much work the process would involve. (Still, the inﬁnite energy of a point charge is a recurring source of embar- rassment for electromagnetic theory, afﬂicting the quantum version as well as the classical. We shall return to the problem in Chapter 11.) Now, you may wonder where the inconsistency crept into an apparently water- tight derivation. The “ﬂaw” lies between Eqs. 2.42 and 2.43: in the former, V (ri ) represents the potential due to all the other charges but not qi , whereas in the latter, V (r) is the full potential. For a continuous distribution, there is no distinc- tion, since the amount of charge right at the point r is vanishingly small, and its contribution to the potential is zero. But in the presence of point charges you’d better stick with Eq. 2.42. (ii) Where is the energy stored? Equations 2.43 and 2.45 offer two different ways of calculating the same thing. The ﬁrst is an integral over the charge dis- tribution; the second is an integral over the ﬁeld. These can involve completely different regions. For instance, in the case of the spherical shell (Ex. 2.9) the charge is conﬁned to the surface, whereas the electric ﬁeld is everywhere outside 2.5 Conductors 97 this surface. Where is the energy, then? Is it stored in the ﬁeld, as Eq. 2.45 seems to suggest, or is it stored in the charge, as Eq. 2.43 implies? At the present stage this is simply an unanswerable question: I can tell you what the total energy is, and I can provide you with several different ways to compute it, but it is imperti- nent to worry about where the energy is located. In the context of radiation theory (Chapter 11) it is useful (and in general relativity it is essential) to regard the energy as stored in the ﬁeld, with a density ϵ0 2 E 2 = energy per unit volume. (2.46) But in electrostatics one could just as well say it is stored in the charge, with a density 1 2 ρV . The difference is purely a matter of bookkeeping. (iii) The superposition principle. Because electrostatic energy is quadratic in the ﬁelds, it does not obey a superposition principle. The energy of a compound system is not the sum of the energies of its parts considered separately—there are also “cross terms”: Wtot = ϵ0 2 ∫ E 2 dτ = ϵ0 2 ∫ (E1 + E2)2 dτ = ϵ0 2 ∫ (E 2 1 + E 2 2 + 2E1 · E2) dτ = W1 + W2 + ϵ0 ∫ E1 · E2 dτ. (2.47) For example, if you double the charge everywhere, you quadruple the total energy. Problem 2.36 Consider two concentric spherical shells, of radii a and b. Suppose the inner one carries a charge q, and the outer one a charge −q (both of them uniformly distributed over the surface). Calculate the energy of this conﬁguration, (a) using Eq. 2.45, and (b) using Eq. 2.47 and the results of Ex. 2.9. Problem 2.37 Find the interaction energy (ϵ0 ∫ E1 · E2 dτ in Eq. 2.47) for two point charges, q1 and q2, a distance a apart. [Hint: Put q1 at the origin and q2 on the z axis; use spherical coordinates, and do the r integral ﬁrst.] 2.5 CONDUCTORS 2.5.1 Basic Properties In an insulator, such as glass or rubber, each electron is on a short leash, attached to a particular atom. In a metallic conductor, by contrast, one or more electrons per atom are free to roam. (In liquid conductors such as salt water, it is ions that do the moving.) A perfect conductor would contain an unlimited supply of free charges. In real life there are no perfect conductors, but metals come pretty close, for most purposes. 98 Chapter 2 Electrostatics From this deﬁnition, the basic electrostatic properties of ideal conductors immediately follow: (i) E = 0 inside a conductor. Why? Because if there were any ﬁeld, those free charges would move, and it wouldn’t be electrostatics any more. Hmm ... that’s hardly a satisfactory explanation; maybe all it proves is that you can’t have electrostatics when conductors are present. We had better examine what happens when you put a conductor into an external electric ﬁeld E0 (Fig. 2.42). Initially, the ﬁeld will drive any free positive charges to the right, and negative ones to the left. (In practice, it’s the negative charges—electrons—that do the moving, but when they depart, the right side is left with a net positive charge—the stationary nuclei—so it doesn’t really matter which charges move; the effect is the same.) When they come to the edge of the material, the charges pile up: plus on the right side, minus on the left. Now, these induced charges produce a ﬁeld of their own, E1, which, as you can see from the ﬁgure, is in the opposite direction to E0. That’s the crucial point, for it means that the ﬁeld of the induced charges tends to cancel the original ﬁeld. Charge will continue to ﬂow until this cancellation is complete, and the resultant ﬁeld inside the conductor is precisely zero.9 The whole process is practically instantaneous. (ii) ρρρ = 0 inside a conductor. This follows from Gauss’s law: ∇ · E = ρ/ϵ0. If E is zero, so also is ρ. There is still charge around, but exactly as much plus as minus, so the net charge density in the interior is zero. (iii) Any net charge resides on the surface. That’s the only place left. (iv) A conductor is an equipotential. For if a and b are any two points within (or at the surface of) a given conductor, V (b) − V (a) =− ∫ b a E · dl = 0, and hence V (a) = V (b). (v) E is perpendicular to the surface, just outside a conductor. Otherwise, as in (i), charge will immediately ﬂow around the surface until it kills off the tangential component (Fig. 2.43). (Perpendicular to the surface, charge cannot ﬂow, of course, since it is conﬁned to the conducting object.) E1 E0 −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ −+ FIGURE 2.42 9Outside the conductor the ﬁeld is not zero, for here E0 and E1 do not tend to cancel. 2.5 Conductors 99 = .onductor = ° 0 FIGURE 2.43 I think it is astonishing that the charge on a conductor ﬂows to the surface. Because of their mutual repulsion, the charges naturally spread out as much as possible, but for all of them to go to the surface seems like a waste of the interior space. Surely we could do better, from the point of view of making each charge as far as possible from its neighbors, to sprinkle some of them throughout the volume ... Well, it simply is not so. You do best to put all the charge on the surface, and this is true regardless of the size or shape of the conductor. 10 The problem can also be phrased in terms of energy. Like any other free dynamical system, the charge on a conductor will seek the conﬁguration that minimizes its potential energy. What property (iii) asserts is that the electrostatic energy of a solid object (with speciﬁed shape and total charge) is a minimum when that charge is spread over the surface. For instance, the energy of a sphere is (1/8πϵ0)(q 2/R) if the charge is uniformly distributed over the surface, as we found in Ex. 2.9, but it is greater, (3/20πϵ0)(q 2/R), if the charge is uniformly distributed throughout the volume (Prob. 2.34). 2.5.2 Induced Charges If you hold a charge +q near an uncharged conductor (Fig. 2.44), the two will attract one another. The reason for this is that q will pull minus charges over to the near side and repel plus charges to the far side. (Another way to think of it is that the charge moves around in such a way as to kill off the ﬁeld of q for points inside the conductor, where the total ﬁeld must be zero.) Since the negative induced charge is closer to q, there is a net force of attraction. (In Chapter 3 we shall calculate this force explicitly, for the case of a spherical conductor.) When I speak of the ﬁeld, charge, or potential “inside” a conductor, I mean in the “meat” of the conductor; if there is some hollow cavity in the conductor, and 10By the way, the one- and two-dimensional analogs are quite different: The charge on a conducting disk does not all go to the perimeter (R. Friedberg, Am.J.Phys. 61, 1084 (1993)), nor does the charge on a conducting needle go to the ends (D. J. Grifﬁths and Y. Li, Am. J. Phys. 64, 706 (1996))—see Prob. 2.57. Moreover, if the exponent of r in Coulomb’s law were not precisely 2, the charge on a solid conductor would not all go to the surface—see D. J. Grifﬁths and D. Z. Uvanovic, Am. J. Phys. 69, 435 (2001), and Prob. 2.54g. 100 Chapter 2 Electrostatics +q Conductor−+ + + + +++−−−−−− − − − − − −++++++ FIGURE 2.44 + Gaussian surface Conductor q E ≠ 0 E = 0 + + + + + + + ++ ++++ + + + + − − − − − −−− − −− − + + FIGURE 2.45 within that cavity you put some charge, then the ﬁeld in the cavity will not be zero. But in a remarkable way the cavity and its contents are electrically isolated from the outside world by the surrounding conductor (Fig. 2.45). No external ﬁelds penetrate the conductor; they are canceled at the outer surface by the induced charge there. Similarly, the ﬁeld due to charges within the cavity is canceled, for all exterior points, by the induced charge on the inner surface. However, the compensating charge left over on the outer surface of the conductor effectively “communicates” the presence of q to the outside world. The total charge induced on the cavity wall is equal and opposite to the charge inside, for if we surround the cavity with a Gaussian surface, all points of which are in the conductor (Fig. 2.45),∮ E · da = 0, and hence (by Gauss’s law) the net enclosed charge must be zero. But Qenc = q + q induced ,so q induced =−q. Then if the conductor as a whole is electrically neutral, there must be a charge +q on its outer surface. Example 2.10. An uncharged spherical conductor centered at the origin has a cavity of some weird shape carved out of it (Fig. 2.46). Somewhere within the cavity is a charge q. Question: What is the ﬁeld outside the sphere? Conductor P Cavity −q +q q r FIGURE 2.46 2.5 Conductors 101 Solution At ﬁrst glance, it would appear that the answer depends on the shape of the cavity and the location of the charge. But that’s wrong: the answer is E = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 ˆr regardless. The conductor conceals from us all information concerning the na- ture of the cavity, revealing only the total charge it contains. How can this be? Well, the charge +q induces an opposite charge −q on the wall of the cavity, which distributes itself in such a way that its ﬁeld cancels that of q, for all points exterior to the cavity. Since the conductor carries no net charge, this leaves +q to distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the sphere. (It’s uniform because the asymmetrical inﬂuence of the point charge +q is negated by that of the induced charge −q on the inner surface.) For points outside the sphere, then, the only thing that survives is the ﬁeld of the leftover +q, uniformly distributed over the outer surface. It may occur to you that in one respect this argument is open to challenge: There are actually three ﬁelds at work here: Eq , E induced, and E leftover.All we know for certain is that the sum of the three is zero inside the conductor, yet I claimed that the ﬁrst two alone cancel, while the third is separately zero there. Moreover, even if the ﬁrst two cancel within the conductor, who is to say they still cancel for points outside? They do not, after all, cancel for points inside the cavity. I cannot give you a completely satisfactory answer at the moment, but this much at least is true: There exists a way of distributing −q over the inner surface so as to cancel the ﬁeld of q at all exterior points. For that same cavity could have been carved out of a huge spherical conductor with a radius of 27 miles or light years or whatever. In that case, the leftover +q on the outer surface is simply too far away to produce a signiﬁcant ﬁeld, and the other two ﬁelds would have to accomplish the cancellation by themselves. So we know they can do it ... but are we sure they choose to? Perhaps for small spheres nature prefers some complicated three- way cancellation. Nope: As we’ll see in the uniqueness theorems of Chapter 3, electrostatics is very stingy with its options; there is always precisely one way— no more—of distributing the charge on a conductor so as to make the ﬁeld inside zero. Having found a possible way, we are guaranteed that no alternative exists, even in principle. If a cavity surrounded by conducting material is itself empty of charge, then the ﬁeld within the cavity is zero. For any ﬁeld line would have to begin and end on the cavity wall, going from a plus charge to a minus charge (Fig. 2.47). Letting that ﬁeld line be part of a closed loop, the rest of which is entirely inside the conductor (where E = 0), the integral ∮ E · dl is distinctly positive, in violation of Eq. 2.19. It follows that E = 0 within an empty cavity, and there is in fact no charge on the surface of the cavity. (This is why you are relatively safe inside a metal car during a thunderstorm—you may get cooked, if lightning strikes, but you will not be electrocuted. The same principle applies to the placement of sensitive apparatus 102 Chapter 2 Electrostatics + − FIGURE 2.47 inside a grounded Faraday cage, to shield out stray electric ﬁelds. In practice, the enclosure doesn’t even have to be solid conductor—chicken wire will often sufﬁce.) Problem 2.38 A metal sphere of radius R, carrying charge q, is surrounded by a thick concentric metal shell (inner radius a, outer radius b, as in Fig. 2.48). The shell carries no net charge. (a) Find the surface charge density σ at R,at a,and at b. (b) Find the potential at the center, using inﬁnity as the reference point. (c) Now the outer surface is touched to a grounding wire, which drains off charge and lowers its potential to zero (same as at inﬁnity). How do your answers to (a) and (b) change? Problem 2.39 Two spherical cavities, of radii a and b, are hollowed out from the interior of a (neutral) conducting sphere of radius R (Fig. 2.49). At the center of each cavity a point charge is placed—call these charges qa and qb. (a) Find the surface charge densities σa, σb,and σR. (b) What is the ﬁeld outside the conductor? (c) What is the ﬁeld within each cavity? (d) What is the force on qa and qb? R a b FIGURE 2.48 qaa R qb b FIGURE 2.49 2.5 Conductors 103 (e) Which of these answers would change if a third charge, qc, were brought near the conductor? Problem 2.40 (a) A point charge q is inside a cavity in an uncharged conductor (Fig. 2.45). Is the force on q necessarily zero?11 (b) Is the force between a point charge and a nearby uncharged conductor always attractive? 12 2.5.3 Surface Charge and the Force on a Conductor Because the ﬁeld inside a conductor is zero, boundary condition 2.33 requires that the ﬁeld immediately outside is E = σ ϵ0 ˆn, (2.48) consistent with our earlier conclusion that the ﬁeld is normal to the surface. In terms of potential, Eq. 2.36 yields σ =−ϵ0 ∂ V ∂n . (2.49) These equations enable you to calculate the surface charge on a conductor, if you can determine E or V ; we shall use them frequently in the next chapter. In the presence of an electric ﬁeld, a surface charge will experience a force; the force per unit area, f,is σ E. But there’s a problem here, for the electric ﬁeld is discontinuous at a surface charge, so what are we supposed to use: Eabove, Ebelow, or something in between? The answer is that we should use the average of the two: f = σ E average = 1 2 σ(E above + E below). (2.50) Eother Patch n 1 2 σ/\u00030 1 2 σ/\u00030 σ FIGURE 2.50 11This problem was suggested by Nelson Christensen. 12See M. Levin and S. G. Johnson, Am.J.Phys. 79, 843 (2011). 104 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Why the average? The reason is very simple, though the telling makes it sound complicated: Let’s focus our attention on a tiny patch of surface surrounding the point in question (Fig. 2.50). (Make it small enough so it is essentially ﬂat and the surface charge on it is essentially constant.) The total ﬁeld consists of two parts—that attributable to the patch itself, and that due to everything else (other regions of the surface, as well as any external sources that may be present): E = E patch + E other . Now, the patch cannot exert a force on itself, any more than you can lift yourself by standing in a basket and pulling up on the handles. The force on the patch, then, is due exclusively to E other, and this suffers no discontinuity (if we removed the patch, the ﬁeld in the “hole” would be perfectly smooth). The discontinuity is due entirely to the charge on the patch, which puts out a ﬁeld (σ/2ϵ0) on either side, pointing away from the surface. Thus, E above = E other + σ 2ϵ0 ˆn, E below = E other − σ 2ϵ0 ˆn, and hence E other = 1 2 (E above + E below) = E average. Averaging is really just a device for removing the contribution of the patch itself. That argument applies to any surface charge; in the particular case of a con- ductor, the ﬁeld is zero inside and (σ/ϵ0) ˆn outside (Eq. 2.48), so the average is (σ/2ϵ0) ˆn, and the force per unit area is f = 1 2ϵ0 σ 2 ˆn. (2.51) This amounts to an outward electrostatic pressure on the surface, tending to draw the conductor into the ﬁeld, regardless of the sign of σ . Expressing the pressure in terms of the ﬁeld just outside the surface, P = ϵ0 2 E 2. (2.52) Problem 2.41 Two large metal plates (each of area A) are held a small distance d apart. Suppose we put a charge Q on each plate; what is the electrostatic pressure on the plates? Problem 2.42 A metal sphere of radius R carries a total charge Q. What is the force of repulsion between the “northern” hemisphere and the “southern” hemisphere? 2.5 Conductors 105 +Q −Q FIGURE 2.51 2.5.4 Capacitors Suppose we have two conductors, and we put charge +Q on one and −Q on the other (Fig. 2.51). Since V is constant over a conductor, we can speak unambigu- ously of the potential difference between them: V = V+ − V− =− ∫ (+) (−) E · dl. We don’t know how the charge distributes itself over the two conductors, and calculating the ﬁeld would be a nightmare, if their shapes are complicated, but this much we do know: E is proportional to Q.For E is given by Coulomb’s law: E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ r2 ˆr dτ, so if you double ρ, you double E. [Wait a minute! How do we know that dou- bling Q (and also −Q) simply doubles ρ? Maybe the charge moves around into a completely different conﬁguration, quadrupling ρ in some places and halving it in others, just so the total charge on each conductor is doubled. The fact is that this concern is unwarranted—doubling Q does double ρ everywhere; it doesn’t shift the charge around. The proof of this will come in Chapter 3; for now you’ll just have to trust me.] Since E is proportional to Q,soalsois V . The constant of proportionality is called the capacitance of the arrangement: C ≡ Q V . (2.53) Capacitance is a purely geometrical quantity, determined by the sizes, shapes, and separation of the two conductors. In SI units, C is measured in farads (F); a farad is a coulomb-per-volt. Actually, this turns out to be inconveniently large; more practical units are the microfarad (10−6 F) and the picofarad (10 −12 F). Notice that V is, by deﬁnition, the potential of the positive conductor less that of the negative one; likewise, Q is the charge of the positive conductor. Ac- cordingly, capacitance is an intrinsically positive quantity. (By the way, you will occasionally hear someone speak of the capacitance of a single conductor. In this case the “second conductor,” with the negative charge, is an imaginary spherical shell of inﬁnite radius surrounding the one conductor. It contributes nothing to the ﬁeld, so the capacitance is given by Eq. 2.53, where V is the potential with inﬁnity as the reference point.) 106 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Example 2.11. Find the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor consisting of two metal surfaces of area A held a distance d apart (Fig. 2.52). d A FIGURE 2.52 Solution If we put +Q on the top and −Q on the bottom, they will spread out uniformly over the two surfaces, provided the area is reasonably large and the separation small. 13 The surface charge density, then, is σ = Q/A on the top plate, and so the ﬁeld, according to Ex. 2.6, is (1/ϵ0)Q/A. The potential difference between the plates is therefore V = Q Aϵ0 d, and hence C = Aϵ0 d . (2.54) If, for instance, the plates are square with sides 1 cm long, and they are held 1 mm apart, then the capacitance is 9 × 10 −13 F. Example 2.12. Find the capacitance of two concentric spherical metal shells, with radii a and b. Solution Place charge +Q on the inner sphere, and −Q on the outer one. The ﬁeld between the spheres is E = 1 4πϵ0 Q r 2 ˆr, so the potential difference between them is V =− ∫ a b E · dl =− Q 4πϵ0 ∫ a b 1 r 2 dr = Q 4πϵ0 √ 1 a − 1 b ) . 13The exact solution is not easy—even for the simpler case of circular plates. See G. T. Carlson and B. L. Illman, Am.J.Phys. 62, 1099 (1994). 2.5 Conductors 107 As promised, V is proportional to Q; the capacitance is C = Q V = 4πϵ0 ab (b − a) . To “charge up” a capacitor, you have to remove electrons from the positive plate and carry them to the negative plate. In doing so, you ﬁght against the electric ﬁeld, which is pulling them back toward the positive conductor and pushing them away from the negative one. How much work does it take, then, to charge the capacitor up to a ﬁnal amount Q? Suppose that at some intermediate stage in the process the charge on the positive plate is q, so that the potential difference is q/C. According to Eq. 2.38, the work you must do to transport the next piece of charge, dq,is dW = ( q C ) dq. The total work necessary, then, to go from q = 0to q = Q,is W = ∫ Q 0 ( q C ) dq = 1 2 Q2 C , or, since Q = CV , W = 1 2 CV 2, (2.55) where V is the ﬁnal potential of the capacitor.

(b) Assuming the electrons start from rest at the cathode, what is their speed at point x, where the potential is V (x)? (c) In the steady state, I is independent of x. What, then, is the relation between ρ and v? (d) Use these three results to obtain a differential equation for V , by eliminating ρ and v. (e) Solve this equation for V as a function of x, V0,and d.

(Equation 2.56 is called the Child-Langmuir law. It holds for other geometries as well, whenever space-charge limits the current. Notice that the space-charge limited diode is nonlinear—it does not obey Ohm’s law.) 110 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Problem 2.54 Imagine that new and extraordinarily precise measurements have re-! vealed an error in Coulomb’s law. The actual force of interaction between two point charges is found to be F = 1 4πϵ0 q1q2 r2 √1 + r λ ) e−(r/λ) ˆr, where λ is a new constant of nature (it has dimensions of length, obviously, and is a huge number—say half the radius of the known universe—so that the correction is small, which is why no one ever noticed the discrepancy before). You are charged with the task of reformulating electrostatics to accommodate the new discovery. Assume the principle of superposition still holds. (a) What is the electric ﬁeld of a charge distribution ρ (replacing Eq. 2.8)? (b) Does this electric ﬁeld admit a scalar potential? Explain brieﬂy how you reached your conclusion. (No formal proof necessary—just a persuasive argument.) (c) Find the potential of a point charge q—the analog to Eq. 2.26. (If your answer to (b) was “no,” better go back and change it!) Use ∞ as your reference point. (d) For a point charge q at the origin, show that ∮ S E · da + 1 λ2 ∫ V Vdτ = 1 ϵ0 q, where S is the surface, V the volume, of any sphere centered at q. (e) Show that this result generalizes: ∮ S E · da + 1 λ2 ∫ V Vdτ = 1 ϵ0 Qenc, for any charge distribution. (This is the next best thing to Gauss’s Law, in the new “electrostatics.”) (f) Draw the triangle diagram (like Fig. 2.35) for this world, putting in all the ap- propriate formulas. (Think of Poisson’s equation as the formula for ρ in terms of V , and Gauss’s law (differential form) as an equation for ρ in terms of E.) (g) Show that some of the charge on a conductor distributes itself (uniformly!) over the volume, with the remainder on the surface. [Hint: E is still zero, inside a conductor.] Problem 2.55 Suppose an electric ﬁeld E(x, y, z) has the form Ex = ax, E y = 0, Ez = 0 where a is a constant. What is the charge density? How do you account for the fact that the ﬁeld points in a particular direction, when the charge density is uniform? [This is a more subtle problem than it looks, and worthy of careful thought.] 2.5 Conductors 111 Problem 2.56 All of electrostatics follows from the 1/r 2 character of Coulomb’s law, together with the principle of superposition. An analogous theory can therefore be constructed for Newton’s law of universal gravitation. What is the gravitational energy of a sphere, of mass M and radius R, assuming the density is uniform? Use your result to estimate the gravitational energy of the sun (look up the relevant numbers). Note that the energy is negative—masses attract, whereas (like) electric charges repel. As the matter “falls in,” to create the sun, its energy is converted into other forms (typically thermal), and it is subsequently released in the form of radia- tion. The sun radiates at a rate of 3.86 × 1026 W; if all this came from gravitational energy, how long would the sun last? [The sun is in fact much older than that, so evidently this is not the source of its power.14] Problem 2.57 We know that the charge on a conductor goes to the surface, but just! how it distributes itself there is not easy to determine. One famous example in which the surface charge density can be calculated explicitly is the ellipsoid: x 2 a2 + y2 b2 + z2 c2 = 1. In this case 15 σ = Q 4πabc √ x 2 a4 + y2 b4 + z2 c4 )−1/2 ,(2.57) where Q is the total charge. By choosing appropriate values for a, b,and c, obtain (from Eq. 2.57): (a) the net (both sides) surface charge density σ(r ) on a circular disk of radius R; (b) the net surface charge density σ(x) on an inﬁnite conducting “ribbon” in the xy plane, which straddles the y axis from x =−a to x = a (let \u000e be the total charge per unit length of ribbon); (c) the net charge per unit length λ(x) on a conducting “needle,” running from x =−a to x = a. In each case, sketch the graph of your result. Problem 2.58 (a) Consider an equilateral triangle, inscribed in a circle of radius a, with a point charge q at each vertex. The electric ﬁeld is zero (obviously) at the center, but (surprisingly) there are three other points inside the triangle where the ﬁeld is zero. Where are they? [Answer: r = 0.285 a—you’ll probably need a computer to get it.] (b) For a regular n-sided polygon there are n points (in addition to the center) where the ﬁeld is zero.16 Find their distance from the center for n = 4and n = 5. What do you suppose happens as n →∞? 14Lord Kelvin used this argument to counter Darwin’s theory of evolution, which called for a much older Earth. Of course, we now know that the source of the Sun’s energy is nuclear fusion, not gravity. 15For the derivation (which is a real tour de force), see W. R.

Phys. 53, 593 (1985). 112 Chapter 2 Electrostatics Problem 2.59 Prove or disprove (with a counterexample) the following Theorem: Suppose a conductor carrying a net charge Q, when placed in an external electric ﬁeld Ee, experiences a force F; if the external ﬁeld is now reversed (Ee →−Ee), the force also reverses (F →−F). What if we stipulate that the external ﬁeld is uniform? Problem 2.60 A point charge q is at the center of an uncharged spherical conducting shell, of inner radius a and outer radius b. Question: How much work would it take to move the charge out to inﬁnity (through a tiny hole drilled in the shell)? [Answer: (q 2/8πϵ0)(1/a − 1/b).] Problem 2.61 What is the minimum-energy conﬁguration for a system of N equal point charges placed on or inside a circle of radius R? 17 Because the charge on a conductor goes to the surface, you might think the N charges would arrange themselves (uniformly) around the circumference. Show (to the contrary) that for N = 12 it is better to place 11 on the circumference and one at the center. How about for N = 11 (is the energy lower if you put all 11 around the circumference, or if you put 10 on the circumference and one at the center)? [Hint: Do it numerically—you’ll need at least 4 signiﬁcant digits. Express all energies as multiples of q 2/4πϵ0 R] 17M. G. Calkin, D. Kiang, and D. A. Tindall, Am.H.Phys. 55, 157 (1987). CHAPTER 3 Potentials 3.1 LAPLACE’S EQUATION 3.1.1 Introduction The primary task of electrostatics is to ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld of a given stationary charge distribution. In principle, this purpose is accomplished by Coulomb’s law, in the form of Eq. 2.8: E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 √ ˆr r2 ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝. (3.1) Unfortunately, integrals of this type can be difﬁcult to calculate for any but the simplest charge conﬁgurations. Occasionally we can get around this by exploiting symmetry and using Gauss’s law, but ordinarily the best strategy is ﬁrst to calcu- late the potential, V , which is given by the somewhat more tractable Eq. 2.29: V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 √ 1 r ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝. (3.2) Still, even this integral is often too tough to handle analytically. Moreover, in prob- lems involving conductors ρ itself may not be known in advance; since charge is free to move around, the only thing we control directly is the total charge (or perhaps the potential) of each conductor. In such cases, it is fruitful to recast the problem in differential form, using Poisson’s equation (2.24), ∇2V =− 1 ϵ0 ρ, (3.3) which, together with appropriate boundary conditions, is equivalent to Eq. 3.2. Very often, in fact, we are interested in ﬁnding the potential in a region where ρ = 0. (If ρ = 0 everywhere, of course, then V = 0, and there is nothing further to say—that’s not what I mean. There may be plenty of charge elsewhere, but we’re conﬁning our attention to places where there is no charge.) In this case, Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation: ∇2V = 0, (3.4) 113 114 Chapter 3 Potentials or, written out in Cartesian coordinates, ∂ 2V ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2V ∂ y2 + ∂ 2V ∂z2 = 0. (3.5) This formula is so fundamental to the subject that one might almost say elec- trostatics is the study of Laplace’s equation. At the same time, it is a ubiquitous equation, appearing in such diverse branches of physics as gravitation and mag- netism, the theory of heat, and the study of soap bubbles. In mathematics, it plays a major role in analytic function theory. To get a feel for Laplace’s equation and its solutions (which are called harmonic functions), we shall begin with the one- and two-dimensional versions, which are easier to picture, and illustrate all the essential properties of the three-dimensional case. 3.1.2 Laplace’s Equation in One Dimension Suppose V depends on only one variable, x. Then Laplace’s equation becomes d 2V dx 2 = 0. The general solution is V (x) = mx + b, (3.6) the equation for a straight line. It contains two undetermined constants (m and b), as is appropriate for a second-order (ordinary) differential equation. They are ﬁxed, in any particular case, by the boundary conditions of that problem. For instance, it might be speciﬁed that V = 4at x = 1, and V = 0at x = 5. In that case, m =−1 and b = 5, so V =−x + 5 (see Fig. 3.1). I want to call your attention to two features of this result; they may seem silly and obvious in one dimension, where I can write down the general solution explic- itly, but the analogs in two and three dimensions are powerful and by no means obvious: x V 1 2 3 4 135246 FIGURE 3.1 3.1 Laplace’s Equation 115 1. V (x) is the average of V (x + a) and V (x − a), for any a: V (x) = 1 2 [V (x + a) + V (x − a)]. Laplace’s equation is a kind of averaging instruction; it tells you to assign to the point x the average of the values to the left and to the right of x. Solutions to Laplace’s equation are, in this sense, as boring as they could possibly be, and yet ﬁt the end points properly. 2. Laplace’s equation tolerates no local maxima or minima; extreme values of V must occur at the end points. Actually, this is a consequence of (1), forifthere were a local maximum, V would be greater at that point than on either side, and therefore could not be the average. (Ordinarily, you expect the second derivative to be negative at a maximum and positive at a minimum. Since Laplace’s equation requires, on the contrary, that the sec- ond derivative is zero, it seems reasonable that solutions should exhibit no extrema. However, this is not a proof, since there exist functions that have maxima and minima at points where the second derivative vanishes: x 4,for example, has such a minimum at the point x = 0.) 3.1.3 Laplace’s Equation in Two Dimensions If V depends on two variables, Laplace’s equation becomes ∂ 2V ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2V ∂ y2 = 0. This is no longer an ordinary differential equation (that is, one involving ordinary derivatives only); it is a partial differential equation. As a consequence, some of the simple rules you may be familiar with do not apply. For instance, the gen- eral solution to this equation doesn’t contain just two arbitrary constants—or, for that matter, any ﬁnite number—despite the fact that it’s a second-order equation. Indeed, one cannot write down a “general solution” (at least, not in a closed form like Eq. 3.6). Nevertheless, it is possible to deduce certain properties common to all solutions. It may help to have a physical example in mind. Picture a thin rubber sheet (or a soap ﬁlm) stretched over some support. For deﬁniteness, suppose you take a card- board box, cut a wavy line all the way around, and remove the top part (Fig. 3.2). Now glue a tightly stretched rubber membrane over the box, so that it ﬁts like a drum head (it won’t be a ﬂat drumhead, of course, unless you chose to cut the edges off straight). Now, if you lay out coordinates (x, y) on the bottom of the box, the height V (x, y) of the sheet above the point (x, y) will satisfy Laplace’s 116 Chapter 3 Potentials R x y V FIGURE 3.2 equation.1 (The one-dimensional analog would be a rubber band stretched between two points. Of course, it would form a straight line.) Harmonic functions in two dimensions have the same properties we noted in one dimension: 1. The value of V at a point (x, y) is the average of those around the point. More precisely, if you draw a circle of any radius R about the point (x, y), the average value of V on the circle is equal to the value at the center: V (x, y) = 1 2π R ∮ circle Vdl. (This, incidentally, suggests the method of relaxation, on which computer solutions to Laplace’s equation are based: Starting with speciﬁed values for V at the boundary, and reasonable guesses for V on a grid of interior points, the ﬁrst pass reassigns to each point the average of its nearest neighbors. The second pass repeats the process, using the corrected values, and so on. After a few iterations, the numbers begin to settle down, so that subsequent passes produce negligible changes, and a numerical solution to Laplace’s equation, with the given boundary values, has been achieved.) 2 2. V has no local maxima or minima; all extrema occur at the boundaries. (As before, this follows from (1).) Again, Laplace’s equation picks the most featureless function possible, consistent with the boundary conditions: no hills, no valleys, just the smoothest conceivable surface. For instance, if you put a ping-pong ball on the stretched rubber sheet of Fig. 3.2, it will 1Actually, the equation satisﬁed by a rubber sheet is ∂ ∂ x (g ∂ V ∂ x ) + ∂ ∂ y (g ∂ V ∂ y ) = 0, where g = [ 1 + ( ∂ V ∂ x )2 + ( ∂ V ∂ y )2]−1/2 ; it reduces (approximately) to Laplace’s equation as long as the surface does not deviate too radically from a plane. 2See, for example, E. M. Purcell, Electricity and Magnetism, 2nd ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1985), problem 3.30. 3.1 Laplace’s Equation 117 roll over to one side and fall off—it will not ﬁnd a “pocket” somewhere to settle into, for Laplace’s equation allows no such dents in the surface. From a geometrical point of view, just as a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, so a harmonic function in two dimensions minimizes the surface area spanning the given boundary line. 3.1.4 Laplace’s Equation in Three Dimensions In three dimensions I can neither provide you with an explicit solution (as in one dimension) nor offer a suggestive physical example to guide your intuition (as I did in two dimensions). Nevertheless, the same two properties remain true, and this time I will sketch a proof.3 1. The value of V at point r is the average value of V over a spherical surface of radius R centered at r: V (r) = 1 4π R2 ∮ sphere Vda. 2. As a consequence, V can have no local maxima or minima; the extreme values of V must occur at the boundaries. (For if V had a local maximum at r, then by the very nature of maximum I could draw a sphere around r over which all values of V —and a fortiori the average—would be less than at r.) Proof. Let’s begin by calculating the average potential over a spherical surface of radius R due to a single point charge q located outside the sphere. We may as well center the sphere at the origin and choose coordinates so that q lies on the z-axis (Fig. 3.3). The potential at a point on the surface is V = 1 4πϵ0 q r , q z daθ R r x y FIGURE 3.3 3For a proof that does not rely on Coulomb’s law (only on Laplace’s equation), see Prob. 3.37. 118 Chapter 3 Potentials where r 2 = z2 + R2 − 2zR cos θ, so Vave = 1 4π R2 q 4πϵ0 √ [z2 + R2 − 2zR cos θ ]−1/2 R2 sin θ dθ dφ = q 4πϵ0 1 2zR √z2 + R2 − 2zR cos θ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ π 0 = q 4πϵ0 1 2zR [(z + R) − (z − R)]= 1 4πϵ0 q z . But this is precisely the potential due to q at the center of the sphere! By the superposition principle, the same goes for any collection of charges outside the sphere: their average potential over the sphere is equal to the net potential they produce at the center. □ Problem 3.1 Find the average potential over a spherical surface of radius R due to a point charge q located inside (same as above, in other words, only with z < R). (In this case, of course, Laplace’s equation does not hold within the sphere.) Show that, in general, Vave = Vcenter + Qenc 4πϵ0 R , where Vcenter is the potential at the center due to all the external charges, and Qenc is the total enclosed charge. Problem 3.2 In one sentence, justify Earnshaw’s Theorem: A charged particle cannot be held in a stable equilibrium by electrostatic forces alone. As an example, consider the cubical arrangement of ﬁxed charges in Fig. 3.4. It looks, off hand, as though a positive charge at the center would be suspended in midair, since it is repelled away from each corner. Where is the leak in this “electrostatic bottle”? [To harness nuclear fusion as a practical energy source it is necessary to heat a plasma (soup of charged particles) to fantastic temperatures—so hot that contact would vaporize any ordinary pot. Earnshaw’s theorem says that electrostatic con- tainment is also out of the question. Fortunately, it is possible to conﬁne a hot plasma magnetically.] q qq q q qq q FIGURE 3.4 3.1 Laplace’s Equation 119 Problem 3.3 Find the general solution to Laplace’s equation in spherical coordi- nates, for the case where V depends only on r . Do the same for cylindrical coordi- nates, assuming V depends only on s. Problem 3.4 (a) Show that the average electric ﬁeld over a spherical surface, due to charges outside the sphere, is the same as the ﬁeld at the center. (b) What is the average due to charges inside the sphere? 3.1.5 Boundary Conditions and Uniqueness Theorems Laplace’s equation does not by itself determine V ; in addition, suitable boundary conditions must be supplied. This raises a delicate question: What are appropriate boundary conditions, sufﬁcient to determine the answer and yet not so strong as to generate inconsistencies? The one-dimensional case is easy, for here the general solution V = mx + b contains two arbitrary constants, and we therefore require two boundary conditions. We might, for instance, specify the value of the function at each end, or we might give the value of the function and its derivative at one end, or the value at one end and the derivative at the other, and so on. But we cannot get away with just the value or just the derivative at one end— this is insufﬁcient information. Nor would it do to specify the derivatives at both ends—this would either be redundant (if the two are equal) or inconsistent (if they are not). In two or three dimensions we are confronted by a partial differential equation, and it is not so obvious what would constitute acceptable boundary conditions. Is the shape of a taut rubber membrane, for instance, uniquely determined by the frame over which it is stretched, or, like a canning jar lid, can it snap from one stable conﬁguration to another? The answer, as I think your intuition would sug- gest, is that Vis uniquely determined by its value at the boundary (canning jars evidently do not obey Laplace’s equation). However, other boundary conditions can also be used (see Prob. 3.5). The proof that a proposed set of boundary condi- tions will sufﬁce is usually presented in the form of a uniqueness theorem. There are many such theorems for electrostatics, all sharing the same basic format—I’ll show you the two most useful ones. 4 First uniqueness theorem: The solution to Laplace’s equation in some volume V is uniquely determined if V is speciﬁed on the boundary surface S. Proof. In Fig. 3.5 I have drawn such a region and its boundary. (There could also be “islands” inside, so long as V is given on all their surfaces; also, the outer 4I do not intend to prove the existence of solutions here—that’s a much more difﬁcult job. In context, the existence is generally clear on physical grounds. 120 Chapter 3 Potentials V wanted in this volume ( )V specified on this surface ( ) V S FIGURE 3.5 boundary could be at inﬁnity, where V is ordinarily taken to be zero.) Suppose there were two solutions to Laplace’s equation: ∇2V1 = 0 and ∇2V2 = 0, both of which assume the speciﬁed value on the surface. I want to prove that they must be equal. The trick is look at their difference: V3 ≡ V1 − V2. This obeys Laplace’s equation, ∇2V3 =∇2V1 −∇2V2 = 0, and it takes the value zero on all boundaries (since V1 and V2 are equal there). But Laplace’s equation allows no local maxima or minima—all extrema occur on the boundaries. So the maximum and minimum of V3 are both zero. Therefore V3 must be zero everywhere, and hence V1 = V2. □ Example 3.1. Show that the potential is constant inside an enclosure com- pletely surrounded by conducting material, provided there is no charge within the enclosure. Solution The potential on the cavity wall is some constant, V0 (that’s item (iv), in Sect. 2.5.1), so the potential inside is a function that satisﬁes Laplace’s equa- tion and has the constant value V0 at the boundary. It doesn’t take a genius to think of one solution to this problem: V = V0 everywhere. The uniqueness the- orem guarantees that this is the only solution. (It follows that the ﬁeld inside an empty cavity is zero—the same result we found in Sect. 2.5.2 on rather different grounds.) The uniqueness theorem is a license to your imagination. It doesn’t matter how you come by your solution; if (a) it satisﬁes Laplace’s equation and (b) it has 3.1 Laplace’s Equation 121 the correct value on the boundaries, then it’s right. You’ll see the power of this argument when we come to the method of images. Incidentally, it is easy to improve on the ﬁrst uniqueness theorem: I assumed there was no charge inside the region in question, so the potential obeyed Laplace’s equation, but we may as well throw in some charge (in which case V obeys Poisson’s equation). The argument is the same, only this time ∇2V1 =− 1 ϵ0 ρ, ∇2V2 =− 1 ϵ0 ρ, so ∇2V3 =∇2V1 −∇2V2 =− 1 ϵ0 ρ + 1 ϵ0 ρ = 0. Once again the difference (V3 ≡ V1 − V2) satisﬁes Laplace’s equation and has the value zero on all boundaries, so V3 = 0 and hence V1 = V2. Corollary: The potential in a volume V is uniquely determined if (a) the charge density throughout the region, and (b) the value of V on all boundaries, are speciﬁed. 3.1.6 Conductors and the Second Uniqueness Theorem The simplest way to set the boundary conditions for an electrostatic problem is to specify the value of V on all surfaces surrounding the region of interest. And this situation often occurs in practice: In the laboratory, we have conductors connected to batteries, which maintain a given potential, or to ground, which is the exper- imentalist’s word for V = 0. However, there are other circumstances in which we do not know the potential at the boundary, but rather the charges on various conducting surfaces. Suppose I put charge Qa on the ﬁrst conductor, Qb on the second, and so on—I’m not telling you how the charge distributes itself over each conducting surface, because as soon as I put it on, it moves around in a way I do not control. And for good measure, let’s say there is some speciﬁed charge density ρ in the region between the conductors. Is the electric ﬁeld now uniquely deter- mined? Or are there perhaps a number of different ways the charges could arrange themselves on their respective conductors, each leading to a different ﬁeld? Second uniqueness theorem: In a volume V surrounded by conduc- tors and containing a speciﬁed charge density ρ, the electric ﬁeld is uniquely determined if the total charge on each conductor is given (Fig. 3.6). (The region as a whole can be bounded by another con- ductor, or else unbounded.) Proof. Suppose there are two ﬁelds satisfying the conditions of the problem. Both obey Gauss’s law in differential form in the space between the conductors: ∇ · E1 = 1 ϵ0 ρ, ∇ · E2 = 1 ϵ0 ρ. 122 Chapter 3 Potentials ρ specified Integration surfaces Outer boundary- could be at infinity Qd Qb Qa Qc FIGURE 3.6 And both obey Gauss’s law in integral form for a Gaussian surface enclosing each conductor: ∮ i th conducting surface E1 · da = 1 ϵ0 Qi , ∮ i th conducting surface E2 · da = 1 ϵ0 Qi . Likewise, for the outer boundary (whether this is just inside an enclosing conduc- tor or at inﬁnity), ∮ outer boundary E1 · da = 1 ϵ0 Qtot, ∮ outer boundary E2 · da = 1 ϵ0 Qtot. As before, we examine the difference E3 ≡ E1 − E2, which obeys ∇ · E3 = 0 (3.7) in the region between the conductors, and ∮ E3 · da = 0 (3.8) over each boundary surface. Now there is one ﬁnal piece of information we must exploit: Although we do not know how the charge Qi distributes itself over the ith conductor, we do know that each conductor is an equipotential, and hence V3 is a constant (not 3.1 Laplace’s Equation 123 necessarily the same constant) over each conducting surface. (It need not be zero, for the potentials V1 and V2 may not be equal—all we know for sure is that both are constant over any given conductor.) Next comes a trick. Invoking product rule number 5 (inside front cover), we ﬁnd that ∇ · (V3E3) = V3(∇ · E3) + E3 · (∇V3) =−(E3)2. Here I have used Eq. 3.7, and E3 =−∇V3. Integrating this over V, and applying the divergence theorem to the left side: √ V ∇ · (V3E3) dτ = ∮ S V3E3 · da =− √ V (E3)2 dτ. The surface integral covers all boundaries of the region in question—the con- ductors and outer boundary. Now V3 is a constant over each surface (if the outer boundary is inﬁnity, V3 = 0 there), so it comes outside each integral, and what remains is zero, according to Eq. 3.8. Therefore, √ V (E3)2 dτ = 0. But this integrand is never negative; the only way the integral can vanish is if E3 = 0 everywhere. Consequently, E1 = E2, and the theorem is proved. □ This proof was not easy, and there is a real danger that the theorem itself will seem more plausible to you than the proof. In case you think the second unique- ness theorem is “obvious,” consider this example of Purcell’s: Figure 3.7 shows a simple electrostatic conﬁguration, consisting of four conductors with charges ±Q, situated so that the plusses are near the minuses. It all looks very comfort- able. Now, what happens if we join them in pairs, by tiny wires, as indicated in Fig. 3.8? Since the positive charges are very near negative charges (which is where they like to be) you might well guess that nothing will happen—the conﬁguration looks stable. Well, that sounds reasonable, but it’s wrong. The conﬁguration in Fig. 3.8 is impossible. For there are now effectively two conductors, and the total charge on each is zero. One possible way to distribute zero charge over these con- ductors is to have no accumulation of charge anywhere, and hence zero ﬁeld + − − + FIGURE 3.7 + − − + FIGURE 3.8 124 Chapter 3 Potentials 0 0 0 0 FIGURE 3.9 everywhere (Fig. 3.9). By the second uniqueness theorem, this must be the solu- tion: The charge will ﬂow down the tiny wires, canceling itself off. Problem 3.5 Prove that the ﬁeld is uniquely determined when the charge density ρ is given and either V or the normal derivative ∂ V /∂n is speciﬁed on each boundary surface. Do not assume the boundaries are conductors, or that V is constant over any given surface. Problem 3.6 A more elegant proof of the second uniqueness theorem uses Green’s identity (Prob. 1.61c), with T = U = V3. Supply the details. 3.2 THE METHOD OF IMAGES 3.2.1 The Classic Image Problem Suppose a point charge q is held a distance d above an inﬁnite grounded con- ducting plane (Fig. 3.10). Question: What is the potential in the region above the plane? It’s not just (1/4πϵ0)q/r,for q will induce a certain amount of negative charge on the nearby surface of the conductor; the total potential is due in part to q directly, and in part to this induced charge. But how can we possibly calcu- late the potential, when we don’t know how much charge is induced or how it is distributed? From a mathematical point of view, our problem is to solve Poisson’s equa- tion in the region z > 0, with a single point charge q at (0, 0, d), subject to the boundary conditions: 1. V = 0 when z = 0 (since the conducting plane is grounded), and 2. V → 0 far from the charge (that is, for x 2 + y2 + z2 ≫ d 2) . The ﬁrst uniqueness theorem (actually, its corollary) guarantees that there is only one function that meets these requirements. If by trick or clever guess we can discover such a function, it’s got to be the answer. Trick: Forget about the actual problem; we’re going to study a completely different situation. This new conﬁguration consists of two point charges, +q at 3.2 The Method of Images 125 y q d x z V = 0 FIGURE 3.10 y +q d d x z −q FIGURE 3.11 (0, 0, d) and −q at (0, 0, −d), and no conducting plane (Fig. 3.11). For this con- ﬁguration, I can easily write down the potential: V (x, y, z) = 1 4πϵ0 [ q √x 2 + y2 + (z − d)2 − q √x 2 + y2 + (z + d)2 ] . (3.9) (The denominators represent the distances from (x, y, z) to the charges +q and −q, respectively.) It follows that 1. V = 0 when z = 0, 2. V → 0for x 2 + y2 + z2 ≫ d 2, and the only charge in the region z > 0 is the point charge +q at (0, 0, d).But these are precisely the conditions of the original problem! Evidently the second conﬁguration happens to produce exactly the same potential as the ﬁrst conﬁg- uration, in the “upper” region z ≥ 0. (The “lower” region, z < 0, is completely different, but who cares? The upper part is all we need.) Conclusion: The poten- tial of a point charge above an inﬁnite grounded conductor is given by Eq. 3.9, for z ≥ 0. Notice the crucial role played by the uniqueness theorem in this argument: without it, no one would believe this solution, since it was obtained for a com- pletely different charge distribution. But the uniqueness theorem certiﬁes it: If it satisﬁes Poisson’s equation in the region of interest, and assumes the correct value at the boundaries, then it must be right. 3.2.2 Induced Surface Charge Now that we know the potential, it is a straightforward matter to compute the surface charge σ induced on the conductor. According to Eq. 2.49, σ =−ϵ0 ∂ V ∂n , 126 Chapter 3 Potentials where ∂ V /∂n is the normal derivative of V at the surface. In this case the normal direction is the z direction, so σ =−ϵ0 ∂ V ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣z=0 . From Eq. 3.9, ∂ V ∂z = 1 4πϵ0 { −q(z − d) [x 2 + y2 + (z − d)2]3/2 + q(z + d) [x 2 + y2 + (z + d)2]3/2 } , so 5 σ(x, y) = −qd 2π(x 2 + y2 + d 2)3/2 . (3.10) As expected, the induced charge is negative (assuming q is positive) and greatest at x = y = 0. While we’re at it, let’s compute the total induced charge Q = √ σ da. This integral, over the xy plane, could be done in Cartesian coordinates, with da = dx dy, but it’s a little easier to use polar coordinates (r,φ), with r 2 = x 2 + y2 and da = rdrdφ. Then σ(r ) = −qd 2π(r 2 + d 2)3/2 , and Q = √ 2π 0 √ ∞ 0 −qd 2π(r 2 + d 2)3/2 rdrdφ = qd √ r 2 + d 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∞ 0 =−q. (3.11) The total charge induced on the plane is −q, as (with beneﬁt of hindsight) you can perhaps convince yourself it had to be. 3.2.3 Force and Energy The charge q is attracted toward the plane, because of the negative induced charge. Let’s calculate the force of attraction. Since the potential in the vicinity of q is the same as in the analog problem (the one with +q and −q but no conductor), so also is the ﬁeld and, therefore, the force: F =− 1 4πϵ0 q 2 (2d)2 ˆz. (3.12) 5For an entirely different derivation of this result, see Prob. 3.38. 3.2 The Method of Images 127 Beware: It is easy to get carried away, and assume that everything is the same in the two problems. Energy, however, is not the same. With the two point charges and no conductor, Eq. 2.42 gives W =− 1 4πϵ0 q 2 2d . (3.13) But for a single charge and conducting plane, the energy is half of this: W =− 1 4πϵ0 q 2 4d . (3.14) Why half? Think of the energy stored in the ﬁelds (Eq. 2.45): W = ϵ0 2 √ E 2 dτ. In the ﬁrst case, both the upper region (z > 0) and the lower region (z < 0) contribute—and by symmetry they contribute equally. But in the second case, only the upper region contains a nonzero ﬁeld, and hence the energy is half as great. 6 Of course, one could also determine the energy by calculating the work required to bring q in from inﬁnity. The force required (to oppose the electri- cal force in Eq. 3.12) is (1/4πϵ0)(q 2/4z2)ˆz,so W = √ d ∞ F · dl = 1 4πϵ0 √ d ∞ q 2 4z2 dz = 1 4πϵ0 ( − q 2 4z )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ d ∞ =− 1 4πϵ0 q 2 4d . As I move q toward the conductor, I do work only on q. It is true that induced charge is moving in over the conductor, but this costs me nothing, since the whole conductor is at potential zero. By contrast, if I simultaneously bring in two point charges (with no conductor), I do work on both of them, and the total is (again) twice as great. 3.2.4 Other Image Problems The method just described is not limited to a single point charge; any station- ary charge distribution near a grounded conducting plane can be treated in the same way, by introducing its mirror image—hence the name method of images. (Remember that the image charges have the opposite sign; this is what guarantees that the xy plane will be at potential zero.) There are also some exotic problems that can be handled in similar fashion; the nicest of these is the following. 6For a generalization of this result, see M. M. Taddei, T. N. C. Mendes, and C. Farina, Eur. J. Phys. 30, 965 (2009), and Prob. 3.41b. 128 Chapter 3 Potentials Example 3.2. A point charge q is situated a distance a from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R (Fig. 3.12). Find the potential outside the sphere. q a R V = 0 FIGURE 3.12 a q'bq r θ r' r FIGURE 3.13 Solution Examine the completely different conﬁguration, consisting of the point charge q together with another point charge q ⃝ =− R a q, (3.15) placed a distance b = R2 a (3.16) to the right of the center of the sphere (Fig. 3.13). No conductor, now—just the two point charges. The potential of this conﬁguration is V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ( q r + q ⃝ r⃝ ) , (3.17) where r and r ⃝ are the distances from q and q ⃝, respectively. Now, it happens (see Prob. 3.8) that this potential vanishes at all points on the sphere, and therefore ﬁts the boundary conditions for our original problem, in the exterior region.7 Conclusion: Eq. 3.17 is the potential of a point charge near a grounded con- ducting sphere. (Notice that b is less than R, so the “image” charge q ⃝ is safely inside the sphere—you cannot put image charges in the region where you are cal- culating V ; that would change ρ, and you’d be solving Poisson’s equation with 7This solution is due to William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), who published it in 1848, when he was just 24. It was apparently inspired by a theorem of Apollonius (200 BC) that says the locus of points with a ﬁxed ratio of distances from two given points is a sphere. See J. C. Maxwell, “Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, Vol. I,” Dover, New York, p. 245. I thank Gabriel Karl for this interesting history. 3.2 The Method of Images 129 the wrong source.) In particular, the force of attraction between the charge and the sphere is F = 1 4πϵ0 qq ⃝ (a − b)2 =− 1 4πϵ0 q 2 Ra (a2 − R2)2 . (3.18) The method of images is delightfully simple ... when it works. But it is as much an art as a science, for you must somehow think up just the right “auxil- iary” conﬁguration, and for most shapes this is forbiddingly complicated, if not impossible. Problem 3.7 Find the force on the charge +q in Fig. 3.14. (The xy plane is a grounded conductor.) V = 0 y +q d 3d x z −2q FIGURE 3.14 Problem 3.8 (a) Using the law of cosines, show that Eq. 3.17 can be written as follows: V (r,θ ) = 1 4πϵ0 [ q √ r 2 + a2 − 2ra cos θ − q √R2 + (ra/R)2 − 2ra cos θ ] , (3.19) where r and θ are the usual spherical polar coordinates, with the z axis along the line through q. In this form, it is obvious that V = 0 on the sphere, r = R. (b) Find the induced surface charge on the sphere, as a function of θ . Integrate this to get the total induced charge. (What should it be?) (c) Calculate the energy of this conﬁguration. Problem 3.9 In Ex. 3.2 we assumed that the conducting sphere was grounded (V = 0). But with the addition of a second image charge, the same basic model will handle the case of a sphere at any potential V0 (relative, of course, to inﬁn- ity). What charge should you use, and where should you put it? Find the force of attraction between a point charge q and a neutral conducting sphere. 130 Chapter 3 Potentials Problem 3.10 A uniform line charge λ is placed on an inﬁnite straight wire, a dis-! tance d above a grounded conducting plane. (Let’s say the wire runs parallel to the x-axis and directly above it, and the conducting plane is the xy plane.) (a) Find the potential in the region above the plane. [Hint: Refer to Prob. 2.52.] (b) Find the charge density σ induced on the conducting plane. Problem 3.11 Two semi-inﬁnite grounded conducting planes meet at right angles. In the region between them, there is a point charge q, situated as shown in Fig. 3.15. Set up the image conﬁguration, and calculate the potential in this region. What charges do you need, and where should they be located? What is the force on q? How much work did it take to bring q in from inﬁnity? Suppose the planes met at some angle other than 90◦; would you still be able to solve the problem by the method of images? If not, for what particular angles does the method work? xa y b q V = 0 FIGURE 3.15 y R −d +d x −V0 R +V0 FIGURE 3.16 Problem 3.12 Two long, straight copper pipes, each of radius R, are held a distance! 2d apart. One is at potential V0, the other at −V0 (Fig. 3.16). Find the potential everywhere. [Hint: Exploit the result of Prob. 2.52.] 3.3 SEPARATION OF VARIABLES In this section we shall attack Laplace’s equation directly, using the method of separation of variables, which is the physicist’s favorite tool for solving par- tial differential equations. The method is applicable in circumstances where the potential (V ) or the charge density (σ ) is speciﬁed on the boundaries of some region, and we are asked to ﬁnd the potential in the interior. The basic strategy is very simple: We look for solutions that are products of functions, each of which depends on only one of the coordinates. The algebraic details, however, can be formidable, so I’m going to develop the method through a sequence of examples. We’ll start with Cartesian coordinates and then do spherical coordinates (I’ll leave the cylindrical case for you to tackle on your own, in Prob. 3.24). 3.3 Separation of Variables 131 3.3.1 Cartesian Coordinates Example 3.3. Two inﬁnite grounded metal plates lie parallel to the xz plane, one at y = 0, the other at y = a (Fig. 3.17). The left end, at x = 0, is closed off with an inﬁnite strip insulated from the two plates, and maintained at a speciﬁc potential V0(y). Find the potential inside this “slot.” x y a z V = 0 V0(y) V = 0 FIGURE 3.17 Solution The conﬁguration is independent of z,sothisisreally a two-dimensional problem. In mathematical terms, we must solve Laplace’s equation, ∂ 2V ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2V ∂ y2 = 0, (3.20) subject to the boundary conditions (i) V = 0 when y = 0, (ii) V = 0 when y = a, (iii) V = V0(y) when x = 0, (iv) V → 0as x →∞. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (3.21) (The latter, although not explicitly stated in the problem, is necessary on physical grounds: as you get farther and farther away from the “hot” strip at x = 0, the potential should drop to zero.) Since the potential is speciﬁed on all boundaries, the answer is uniquely determined. The ﬁrst step is to look for solutions in the form of products: V (x, y) = X (x)Y (y). (3.22) On the face of it, this is an absurd restriction—the overwhelming majority of solutions to Laplace’s equation do not have such a form. For example, V (x, y) = 132 Chapter 3 Potentials (5x + 6y) satisﬁes Eq. 3.20, but you can’t express it as the product of a function x times a function y. Obviously, we’re only going to get a tiny subset of all possible solutions by this means, and it would be a miracle if one of them happened to ﬁt the boundary conditions of our problem ... But hang on, because the solutions we do get are very special, and it turns out that by pasting them together we can construct the general solution. Anyway, putting Eq. 3.22 into Eq. 3.20, we obtain Y d 2 X dx 2 + X d 2Y dy2 = 0. The next step is to “separate the variables” (that is, collect all the x-dependence into one term and all the y-dependence into another). Typically, this is accom- plished by dividing through by V : 1 X d 2 X dx 2 + 1 Y d 2Y dy2 = 0. (3.23) Here the ﬁrst term depends only on x and the second only on y; in other words, we have an equation of the form f (x) + g(y) = 0. (3.24) Now, there’s only one way this could possibly be true: f and g must both be constant. For what if f (x) changed, as you vary x—then if we held y ﬁxed and ﬁddled with x,the sum f (x) + g(y) would change, in violation of Eq. 3.24, which says it’s always zero. (That’s a simple but somehow rather elusive argument; don’t accept it without due thought, because the whole method rides on it.) It follows from Eq. 3.23, then, that 1 X d 2 X dx 2 = C1 and 1 Y d 2Y dy2 = C2, with C1 + C2 = 0. (3.25) One of these constants is positive, the other negative (or perhaps both are zero). In general, one must investigate all the possibilities; however, in our particular problem we need C1 positive and C2 negative, for reasons that will appear in a moment. Thus d 2 X dx 2 = k2 X, d 2Y dy2 =−k2Y. (3.26) Notice what has happened: A partial differential equation (3.20) has been con- verted into two ordinary differential equations (3.26). The advantage of this is obvious—ordinary differential equations are a lot easier to solve. Indeed: X (x) = Aekx + Be−kx , Y (y) = C sin ky + D cos ky, so V (x, y) = (Aekx + Be−kx )(C sin ky + D cos ky). (3.27) 3.3 Separation of Variables 133 This is the appropriate separable solution to Laplace’s equation; it remains to impose the boundary conditions, and see what they tell us about the constants. To begin at the end, condition (iv) requires that A equal zero. 8 Absorbing B into C and D, we are left with V (x, y) = e−kx (C sin ky + D cos ky). Condition (i) now demands that D equal zero, so V (x, y) = Ce−kx sin ky. (3.28) Meanwhile (ii) yields sin ka = 0, from which it follows that k = nπ a ,(n = 1, 2, 3,...). (3.29) (At this point you can see why I chose C1 positive and C2 negative: If X were sinusoidal, we could never arrange for it to go to zero at inﬁnity, and if Y were exponential we could not make it vanish at both 0 and a. Incidentally, n = 0is no good, for in that case the potential vanishes everywhere. And we have already excluded negative n’s.) That’s as far as we can go, using separable solutions, and unless V0(y) just happens to have the form sin(nπ y/a) for some integer n,wesimply can’t ﬁt the ﬁnal boundary condition at x = 0. But now comes the crucial step that redeems the method: Separation of variables has given us an inﬁnite family of solutions (one for each n), and whereas none of them by itself satisﬁes the ﬁnal boundary condition, it is possible to combine them in a way that does. Laplace’s equation is linear, in the sense that if V1, V2, V3, ... satisfy it, so does any linear combina- tion, V = α1V1 + α2V2 + α3V3 + ... , where α1, α2,... are arbitrary constants. For ∇2V = α1∇2V1 + α2∇2V2 + ... = 0α1 + 0α2 + ... = 0. Exploiting this fact, we can patch together the separable solutions (Eq. 3.28) to construct a much more general solution: V (x, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cne−nπ x/a sin(nπ y/a). (3.30) This still satisﬁes three of the boundary conditions; the question is, can we (by astute choice of the coefﬁcients Cn) ﬁt the ﬁnal boundary condition (iii)? V (0, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cn sin(nπ y/a) = V0(y). (3.31) 8I’m assuming k is positive, but this involves no loss of generality—negative k gives the same solution (Eq. 3.27), only with the constants shufﬂed (A ↔ B, C →−C). Occasionally (though not in this example) k = 0 must also be included (see Prob. 3.54). 134 Chapter 3 Potentials Well, you may recognize this sum—it’s a Fourier sine series. And Dirichlet’s theorem 9 guarantees that virtually any function V0(y)—it can even have a ﬁnite number of discontinuities—can be expanded in such a series. But how do we actually determine the coefﬁcients Cn, buried as they are in that inﬁnite sum? The device for accomplishing this is so lovely it deserves a name—I call it Fourier’s trick, though it seems Euler had used essentially the same idea somewhat earlier. Here’s how it goes: Multiply Eq. 3.31 by sin(n⃝π y/a) (where n⃝ is a positive integer), and integrate from 0 to a: ∞∑ n=1 Cn √ a 0 sin(nπ y/a) sin(n⃝π y/a) dy = √ a 0 V0(y) sin(n⃝π y/a) dy. (3.32) You can work out the integral on the left for yourself; the answer is √ a 0 sin(nπ y/a) sin(n⃝π y/a) dy = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0, if n⃝ ̸= n, a 2 , if n⃝ = n. (3.33) Thus all the terms in the series drop out, save only the one where n = n⃝, and the left side of Eq. 3.32, reduces to (a/2)Cn⃝ . Conclusion:10 Cn = 2 a √ a 0 V0(y) sin(nπ y/a) dy. (3.34) That does it: Eq. 3.30 is the solution, with coefﬁcients given by Eq. 3.34. As a concrete example, suppose the strip at x = 0 is a metal plate with con- stant potential V0 (remember, it’s insulated from the grounded plates at y = 0 and y = a). Then Cn = 2V0 a √ a 0 sin(nπ y/a) dy = 2V0 nπ (1 − cos nπ) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0, if n is even, 4V0 nπ , if n is odd. (3.35) Thus V (x, y) = 4V0 π ∑ n=1,3,5... 1 n e−nπ x/a sin(nπ y/a). (3.36) Figure 3.18 is a plot of this potential; Fig. 3.19 shows how the ﬁrst few terms in the Fourier series combine to make a better and better approximation to the constant V0:(a) is n = 1 only, (b) includes n up to 5, (c) is the sum of the ﬁrst 10 terms, and (d) is the sum of the ﬁrst 100 terms. 9Boas, M., Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 2nd ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1983). 10For aesthetic reasons I’ve dropped the prime; Eq. 3.34 holds for n = 1, 2, 3,... , and it doesn’t matter (obviously) what letter you use for the “dummy” index. 3.3 Separation of Variables 135 1.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 0.5V/Vo x/a y/a FIGURE 3.18 y/a 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.2 (d)(c) (b) (a) 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 V/Vo FIGURE 3.19 Incidentally, the inﬁnite series in Eq. 3.36 can be summed explicitly (try your hand at it, if you like); the result is V (x, y) = 2V0 π tan−1 ( sin(π y/a) sinh(π x/a) ) . (3.37) In this form, it is easy to check that Laplace’s equation is obeyed and the four boundary conditions (Eq. 3.21) are satisﬁed. The success of this method hinged on two extraordinary properties of the sep- arable solutions (Eqs. 3.28 and 3.29): completeness and orthogonality. A set of functions fn(y) is said to be complete if any other function f (y) can be expressed as a linear combination of them: f (y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cn fn(y). (3.38) The functions sin(nπ y/a) are complete on the interval 0 ≤ y ≤ a. It was this fact, guaranteed by Dirichlet’s theorem, that assured us Eq. 3.31 could be satisﬁed, given the proper choice of the coefﬁcients Cn.(The proof of completeness, for a particular set of functions, is an extremely difﬁcult business, and I’m afraid 136 Chapter 3 Potentials physicists tend to assume it’s true and leave the checking to others.) A set of functions is orthogonal if the integral of the product of any two different members of the set is zero: √ a 0 fn(y) fn⃝ (y) dy = 0for n⃝ ̸= n. (3.39) The sine functions are orthogonal (Eq. 3.33); this is the property on which Fourier’s trick is based, allowing us to kill off all terms but one in the inﬁnite series and thereby solve for the coefﬁcients Cn. (Proof of orthogonality is gen- erally quite simple, either by direct integration or by analysis of the differential equation from which the functions came.) Example 3.4. Two inﬁnitely-long grounded metal plates, again at y = 0 and y = a, are connected at x =±b by metal strips maintained at a constant potential V0, as shown in Fig. 3.20 (a thin layer of insulation at each corner prevents them from shorting out). Find the potential inside the resulting rectangular pipe. Solution Once again, the conﬁguration is independent of z. Our problem is to solve Laplace’s equation ∂ 2V ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2V ∂ y2 = 0, subject to the boundary conditions (i) V = 0 when y = 0, (ii) V = 0 when y = a, (iii) V = V0 when x = b, (iv) V = V0 when x =−b. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (3.40) The argument runs as before, up to Eq. 3.27: V (x, y) = (Aekx + Be−kx )(C sin ky + D cos ky). x y a V0 V0 z V=0 V=0 −bb FIGURE 3.20 3.3 Separation of Variables 137 This time, however, we cannot set A = 0; the region in question does not extend to x =∞,so ekx is perfectly acceptable. On the other hand, the situa- tion is symmetric with respect to x,so V (−x, y) = V (x, y), and it follows that A = B.Using ekx + e−kx = 2 cosh kx, and absorbing 2A into C and D,wehave V (x, y) = cosh kx (C sin ky + D cos ky). Boundary conditions (i) and (ii) require, as before, that D = 0 and k = nπ/a,so V (x, y) = C cosh(nπ x/a) sin(nπ y/a). (3.41) Because V (x, y) is even in x, it will automatically meet condition (iv) if it ﬁts (iii). It remains, therefore, to construct the general linear combination, V (x, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cn cosh(nπ x/a) sin(nπ y/a), and pick the coefﬁcients Cn in such a way as to satisfy condition (iii): V (b, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cn cosh(nπ b/a) sin(nπ y/a) = V0. This is the same problem in Fourier analysis that we faced before; I quote the result from Eq. 3.35: Cn cosh(nπ b/a) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0, if n is even 4V0 nπ , if n is odd Conclusion: The potential in this case is given by V (x, y) = 4V0 π ∑ n=1,3,5... 1 n cosh(nπ x/a) cosh(nπ b/a) sin(nπ y/a).

(3.45) Putting this into Eq. 3.43, and dividing by V , we ﬁnd 1 X d 2 X dx 2 + 1 Y d 2Y dy2 + 1 Z d 2 Z dz2 = 0. It follows that 1 X d 2 X dx 2 = C1, 1 Y d 2Y dy2 = C2, 1 Z d 2 Z dz2 = C3, with C1 + C2 + C3 = 0. Our previous experience (Ex. 3.3) suggests that C1 must be positive, C2 and C3 negative. Setting C2 =−k2 and C3 =−l 2,wehave C1 = k2 + l 2, and hence d 2 X dx 2 = (k2 + l 2)X, d 2Y dy2 =−k2Y, d 2 Z dz2 =−l 2 Z . (3.46) Once again, separation of variables has turned a partial differential equation into ordinary differential equations. The solutions are X (x) = Ae√k2+l2 x + Be− √k2+l2 x , Y (y) = C sin ky + D cos ky, Z (z) = E sin lz + F cos lz. Boundary condition (v) implies A = 0, (i) gives D = 0, and (iii) yields F = 0, whereas (ii) and (iv) require that k = nπ/a and l = mπ/b, where n and m are positive integers. Combining the remaining constants, we are left with V (x, y, z) = Ce−π√(n/a)2+(m/b)2 x sin(nπ y/a) sin(mπ z/b). (3.47) This solution meets all the boundary conditions except (vi). It contains two un- speciﬁed integers (n and m), and the most general linear combination is a double sum: V (x, y, z) = ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 Cn,me−π√(n/a)2+(m/b)2 x sin(nπ y/a) sin(mπ z/b). (3.48) We hope to ﬁt the remaining boundary condition, V (0, y, z) = ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 Cn,m sin(nπ y/a) sin(mπ z/b) = V0(y, z), (3.49) 140 Chapter 3 Potentials by appropriate choice of the coefﬁcients Cn,m. To determine these constants, we multiply by sin(n⃝π y/a) sin(m⃝π z/b), where n⃝ and m⃝ are arbitrary positive integers, and integrate: ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 Cn,m √ a 0 sin(nπ y/a) sin(n⃝π y/a) dy √ b 0 sin(mπ z/b) sin(m⃝π z/b) dz = √ a 0 √ b 0 V0(y, z) sin(n⃝π y/a) sin(m⃝π z/b) dy dz. Quoting Eq. 3.33, the left side is (ab/4)Cn⃝,m⃝ ,so Cn,m = 4 ab √ a 0 √ b 0 V0(y, z) sin(nπ y/a) sin(mπ z/b) dy dz. (3.50) Equation 3.48, with the coefﬁcients given by Eq. 3.50, is the solution to our problem. For instance, if the end of the tube is a conductor at constant potential V0, Cn,m = 4V0 ab √ a 0 sin(nπ y/a) dy √ b 0 sin(mπ z/b) dz = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0, if n or m is even, 16V0 π 2nm , if n and m are odd. (3.51) In this case V (x, y, z) = 16V0 π 2 ∞∑ n,m=1,3,5... 1 nm e−π√(n/a)2+(m/b)2 x sin(nπ y/a) sin(mπ z/b). (3.52) Notice that the successive terms decrease rapidly; a reasonable approximation would be obtained by keeping only the ﬁrst few. Problem 3.13 Find the potential in the inﬁnite slot of Ex. 3.3 if the boundary at x = 0 consists of two metal strips: one, from y = 0to y = a/2, is held at a constant potential V0, and the other, from y = a/2to y = a, is at potential −V0. Problem 3.14 For the inﬁnite slot (Ex. 3.3), determine the charge density σ(y) on the strip at x = 0, assuming it is a conductor at constant potential V0. Problem 3.15 A rectangular pipe, running parallel to the z-axis (from −∞ to +∞), has three grounded metal sides, at y = 0, y = a,and x = 0. The fourth side, at x = b, is maintained at a speciﬁed potential V0(y). (a) Develop a general formula for the potential inside the pipe. (b) Find the potential explicitly, for the case V0(y) = V0 (a constant). 3.3 Separation of Variables 141 Problem 3.16 A cubical box (sides of length a) consists of ﬁve metal plates, which are welded together and grounded (Fig. 3.23). The top is made of a separate sheet of metal, insulated from the others, and held at a constant potential V0.Findthe potential inside the box. [What should the potential at the center (a/2, a/2, a/2) be? Check numerically that your formula is consistent with this value.]11 y z x V0 a a a FIGURE 3.23 3.3.2 Spherical Coordinates In the examples considered so far, Cartesian coordinates were clearly appropriate, since the boundaries were planes. For round objects, spherical coordinates are more natural. In the spherical system, Laplace’s equation reads: 1 r 2 ∂ ∂r ( r 2 ∂ V ∂r ) + 1 r 2 sin θ ∂ ∂θ ( sin θ ∂ V ∂θ ) + 1 r 2 sin 2 θ ∂ 2V ∂φ2 = 0. (3.53) I shall assume the problem has azimuthal symmetry, so that V is independent of φ; 12 in that case, Eq. 3.53 reduces to ∂ ∂r ( r 2 ∂ V ∂r ) + 1 sin θ ∂ ∂θ ( sin θ ∂ V ∂θ ) = 0. (3.54) As before, we look for solutions that are products: V (r,θ ) = R(r )\f(θ ). (3.55) Putting this into Eq. 3.54, and dividing by V , 1 R d dr ( r 2 dR dr ) + 1 \f sin θ d dθ (sin θ d\f dθ ) = 0. (3.56) 11This cute test was suggested by J. Castro. 12The general case, for φ-dependent potentials, is treated in all the graduate texts. See, for instance, J. D. Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1999), Chapter 3. 142 Chapter 3 Potentials Since the ﬁrst term depends only on r , and the second only on θ ,itfollows that each must be a constant: 1 R d dr ( r 2 dR dr ) = l(l + 1), 1 \f sin θ d dθ ( sin θ d\f dθ ) =−l(l + 1). (3.57) Here l(l + 1) is just a fancy way of writing the separation constant—you’ll see in a minute why this is convenient. As always, separation of variables has converted a partial differential equation (3.54) into ordinary differential equations (3.57). The radial equation, d dr ( r 2 dR dr ) = l(l + 1)R, (3.58) has the general solution R(r ) = Ar l + B r l+1 , (3.59) as you can easily check; A and B are the two arbitrary constants to be expected in the solution of a second-order differential equation. But the angular equation, d dθ ( sin θ d\f dθ ) =−l(l + 1) sin θ\f, (3.60) is not so simple. The solutions are Legendre polynomials in the variable cos θ : \f(θ ) = Pl(cos θ). (3.61) Pl(x) is most conveniently deﬁned by the Rodrigues formula: Pl(x) ≡ 1 2ll! ( d dx )l (x 2 − 1) l. (3.62) The ﬁrst few Legendre polynomials are listed in Table 3.1. P0(x) =1 P1(x) = x P2(x) = (3x 2 − 1)/2 P3(x) = (5x 3 − 3x)/2 P4(x) = (35x 4 − 30x 2 + 3)/8 P5(x) = (63x 5 − 70x 3 + 15x)/8 TABLE 3.1 Legendre Polynomials. 3.3 Separation of Variables 143 Notice that Pl(x) is (as the name suggests) an lth-order polynomial in x; it con- tains only even powers, if l is even, and odd powers, if l is odd. The factor in front (1/2 ll!) was chosen in order that Pl(1) = 1. (3.63) The Rodrigues formula obviously works only for nonnegative integer values of l. Moreover, it provides us with only one solution. But Eq. 3.60 is second- order, and it should possess two independent solutions, for every value of l.It turns out that these “other solutions” blow up at θ = 0 and/or θ = π , and are therefore unacceptable on physical grounds. 13 For instance, the second solution for l = 0is \f(θ ) = ln ( tan θ 2 ) . (3.64) You might want to check for yourself that this satisﬁes Eq. 3.60. In the case of azimuthal symmetry, then, the most general separable solution to Laplace’s equation, consistent with minimal physical requirements, is V (r,θ ) = (Ar l + B r l+1 ) Pl(cos θ). (There was no need to include an overall constant in Eq. 3.61 because it can be absorbed into A and B at this stage.) As before, separation of variables yields an inﬁnite set of solutions, one for each l.The general solution is the linear combi- nation of separable solutions: V (r,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 (Alr l + Bl r l+1 ) Pl(cos θ). (3.65) The following examples illustrate the power of this important result. Example 3.6. The potential V0(θ ) is speciﬁed on the surface of a hollow sphere, of radius R. Find the potential inside the sphere. Solution In this case, Bl = 0 for all l—otherwise the potential would blow up at the origin. Thus, V (r,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 Alr l Pl(cos θ). (3.66) 13In rare cases where the z axis is excluded, these “other solutions” do have to be considered. 144 Chapter 3 Potentials At r = R this must match the speciﬁed function V0(θ ): V (R,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 Al Rl Pl(cos θ) = V0(θ ). (3.67) Can this equation be satisﬁed, for an appropriate choice of coefﬁcients Al? Yes: The Legendre polynomials (like the sines) constitute a complete set of functions, on the interval −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 (0 ≤ θ ≤ π). How do we determine the constants? Again, by Fourier’s trick, for the Legendre polynomials (like the sines) are or- thogonal functions: 14 √ 1 −1 Pl(x)Pl⃝ (x) dx = √ π 0 Pl(cos θ)Pl⃝ (cos θ) sin θ dθ = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0, if l ⃝ ̸= l, 2 2l + 1 , if l ⃝ = l. (3.68) Thus, multiplying Eq. 3.67 by Pl⃝ (cos θ) sin θ and integrating, we have Al⃝ Rl⃝ 2 2l ⃝ + 1 = √ π 0 V0(θ )Pl⃝(cos θ) sin θ dθ, or Al = 2l + 1 2Rl √ π 0 V0(θ )Pl(cos θ) sin θ dθ. (3.69) Equation 3.66 is the solution to our problem, with the coefﬁcients given by Eq. 3.69. It can be difﬁcult to evaluate integrals of the form 3.69 analytically, and in practice it is often easier to solve Eq. 3.67 “by eyeball.” 15 For instance, suppose we are told that the potential on the sphere is V0(θ ) = k sin 2(θ/2), (3.70) where k is a constant. Using the half-angle formula, we rewrite this as V0(θ ) = k 2 (1 − cos θ ) = k 2 [P0(cos θ) − P1(cos θ)]. 14M. Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 2nd ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1983), Section 12.7. 15This is certainly true whenever V0(θ ) can be expressed as a polynomial in cos θ . The degree of the polynomial tells us the highest l we require, and the leading coefﬁcient determines the corresponding Al . Subtracting off Al Rl Pl (cos θ) and repeating the process, we systematically work our way down to A0. Notice that if V0 is an even function of cos θ , then only even terms will occur in the sum (and likewise for odd functions). 3.3 Separation of Variables 145 Putting this into Eq. 3.67, we read off immediately that A0 = k/2, A1 =−k/(2R), and all other Al’s vanish. Therefore, V (r,θ ) = k 2 [ r 0 P0(cos θ) − r 1 R P1(cos θ)] = k 2 ( 1 − r R cos θ ) . (3.71) Example 3.7. The potential V0(θ ) is again speciﬁed on the surface of a sphere of radius R, but this time we are asked to ﬁnd the potential outside, assuming there is no charge there. Solution In this case it’s the Al’s that must be zero (or else V would not go to zero at ∞), so V (r,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 Bl r l+1 Pl(cos θ). (3.72) At the surface of the sphere, we require that V (R,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 Bl Rl+1 Pl(cos θ) = V0(θ ). Multiplying by Pl⃝(cos θ) sin θ and integrating—exploiting, again, the orthogo- nality relation 3.68—we have Bl⃝ Rl⃝+1 2 2l ⃝ + 1 = √ π 0 V0(θ )Pl⃝(cos θ) sin θ dθ, or Bl = 2l + 1 2 Rl+1 √ π 0 V0(θ )Pl(cos θ) sin θ dθ. (3.73) Equation 3.72, with the coefﬁcients given by Eq. 3.73, is the solution to our problem. Example 3.8. An uncharged metal sphere of radius R is placed in an other- wise uniform electric ﬁeld E = E0 ˆz. The ﬁeld will push positive charge to the “northern” surface of the sphere, and—symmetrically—negative charge to the “southern” surface (Fig. 3.24). This induced charge, in turn, distorts the ﬁeld in the neighborhood of the sphere. Find the potential in the region outside the sphere. 146 Chapter 3 Potentials Solution The sphere is an equipotential—we may as well set it to zero. Then by symmetry the entire xy plane is at potential zero. This time, however, V does not go to zero at large z. In fact, far from the sphere the ﬁeld is E0 ˆz, and hence V →−E0z + C. −−− +++ −−−−− +++++ y z x R FIGURE 3.24 Since V = 0 in the equatorial plane, the constant C must be zero. Accordingly, the boundary conditions for this problem are (i) V = 0 when r = R, (ii) V →−E0r cos θ for r ≫ R. } (3.74) We must ﬁt these boundary conditions with a function of the form 3.65. The ﬁrst condition yields Al Rl + Bl Rl+1 = 0, or Bl =−Al R2l+1, (3.75) so V (r,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 Al ( r l − R2l+1 r l+1 ) Pl(cos θ). For r ≫ R, the second term in parentheses is negligible, and therefore condition (ii) requires that ∞∑ l=0 Alr l Pl(cos θ) =−E0r cos θ. 3.3 Separation of Variables 147 Evidently only one term is present: l = 1. In fact, since P1(cos θ) = cos θ , we can read off immediately A1 =−E0, all other Al’s zero. Conclusion: V (r,θ ) =−E0 ( r − R3 r 2 ) cos θ. (3.76) The ﬁrst term (−E0r cos θ) is due to the external ﬁeld; the contribution attributable to the induced charge is E0 R3 r 2 cos θ. If you want to know the induced charge density, it can be calculated in the usual way: σ(θ ) =− ϵ0 ∂ V ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r =R = ϵ0 E0 ( 1 + 2 R3 r 3 ) cos θ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r =R = 3ϵ0 E0 cos θ. (3.77) As expected, it is positive in the “northern” hemisphere (0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2) and neg- ative in the “southern” (π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π). Example 3.9. A speciﬁed charge density σ0(θ ) is glued over the surface of a spherical shell of radius R. Find the resulting potential inside and outside the sphere. Solution You could, of course, do this by direct integration: V = 1 4πϵ0 √ σ0 r da, but separation of variables is often easier. For the interior region, we have V (r,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 Alr l Pl(cos θ) (r ≤ R) (3.78) (no Bl terms—they blow up at the origin); in the exterior region V (r,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 Bl r l+1 Pl(cos θ) (r ≥ R) (3.79) (no Al terms—they don’t go to zero at inﬁnity). These two functions must be joined together by the appropriate boundary conditions at the surface itself. First, the potential is continuous at r = R (Eq. 2.34): 148 Chapter 3 Potentials ∞∑ l=0 Al Rl Pl(cos θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Bl Rl+1 Pl(cos θ). (3.80) It follows that the coefﬁcients of like Legendre polynomials are equal: Bl = Al R2l+1. (3.81) (To prove that formally, multiply both sides of Eq. 3.80 by Pl⃝ (cos θ) sin θ and integrate from 0 to π , using the orthogonality relation 3.68.) Second, the radial derivative of V suffers a discontinuity at the surface (Eq. 2.36): ( ∂ Vout ∂r − ∂ Vin ∂r )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r =R =− 1 ϵ0 σ0(θ ). (3.82) Thus − ∞∑ l=0 (l + 1) Bl Rl+2 Pl(cos θ) − ∞∑ l=0 lAl Rl−1 Pl(cos θ) =− 1 ϵ0 σ0(θ ), or, using Eq. 3.81, ∞∑ l=0 (2l + 1)Al Rl−1 Pl(cos θ) = 1 ϵ0 σ0(θ ). (3.83) From here, the coefﬁcients can be determined using Fourier’s trick: Al = 1 2ϵ0 Rl−1 √ π 0 σ0(θ )Pl(cos θ) sin θ dθ. (3.84) Equations 3.78 and 3.79 constitute the solution to our problem, with the coefﬁ- cients given by Eqs. 3.81 and 3.84. For instance, if σ0(θ ) = k cos θ = kP1(cos θ), (3.85) for some constant k, then all the Al’s are zero except for l = 1, and A1 = k 2ϵ0 √ π 0 [P1(cos θ)]2 sin θ dθ = k 3ϵ0 . The potential inside the sphere is therefore V (r,θ ) = k 3ϵ0 r cos θ(r ≤ R), (3.86) 3.3 Separation of Variables 149 whereas outside the sphere V (r,θ ) = kR3 3ϵ0 1 r 2 cos θ(r ≥ R). (3.87) In particular, if σ0(θ ) is the induced charge on a metal sphere in an external ﬁeld E0 ˆz, so that k = 3ϵ0 E0 (Eq. 3.77), then the potential inside is E0r cos θ = E0z, and the ﬁeld is −E0 ˆz—exactly right to cancel off the external ﬁeld, as of course it should be. Outside the sphere the potential due to this surface charge is E0 R3 r 2 cos θ, consistent with our conclusion in Ex. 3.8. Problem 3.17 Derive P3(x) from the Rodrigues formula, and check that P3(cos θ) satisﬁes the angular equation (3.60) for l = 3. Check that P3 and P1 are orthogonal by explicit integration. Problem 3.18 (a) Suppose the potential is a constant V0 over the surface of the sphere. Use the results of Ex. 3.6 and Ex. 3.7 to ﬁnd the potential inside and outside the sphere. (Of course, you know the answers in advance—this is just a consistency check on the method.) (b) Find the potential inside and outside a spherical shell that carries a uniform surface charge σ0, using the results of Ex. 3.9. Problem 3.19 The potential at the surface of a sphere (radius R)isgiven by V0 = k cos 3θ, where k is a constant. Find the potential inside and outside the sphere, as well as the surface charge density σ(θ ) on the sphere. (Assume there’s no charge inside or outside the sphere.) Problem 3.20 Suppose the potential V0(θ) at the surface of a sphere is speciﬁed, and there is no charge inside or outside the sphere. Show that the charge density on the sphere is given by σ(θ ) = ϵ0 2R ∞∑ l=0 (2l + 1)2Cl Pl (cos θ), (3.88) where Cl = √ π 0 V0(θ)Pl (cos θ) sin θ dθ. (3.89) 150 Chapter 3 Potentials Problem 3.21 Find the potential outside a charged metal sphere (charge Q, radius R) placed in an otherwise uniform electric ﬁeld E0. Explain clearly where you are setting the zero of potential. Problem 3.22 In Prob. 2.25, you found the potential on the axis of a uniformly charged disk: V (r, 0) = σ 2ϵ0 (√ r 2 + R2 − r ) . (a) Use this, together with the fact that Pl (1) = 1, to evaluate the ﬁrst three terms in the expansion (Eq. 3.72) for the potential of the disk at points off the axis, assuming r > R. (b) Find the potential for r < R by the same method, using Eq. 3.66. [Note: You must break the interior region up into two hemispheres, above and below the disk. Do not assume the coefﬁcients Al are the same in both hemispheres.] Problem 3.23 A spherical shell of radius R carries a uniform surface charge σ0 on the “northern” hemisphere and a uniform surface charge −σ0 on the “southern” hemisphere. Find the potential inside and outside the sphere, calculating the coefﬁ- cients explicitly up to A6 and B6. Problem 3.24 Solve Laplace’s equation by separation of variables in cylindrical• coordinates, assuming there is no dependence on z (cylindrical symmetry). [Make sure you ﬁnd all solutions to the radial equation; in particular, your result must accommodate the case of an inﬁnite line charge, for which (of course) we already know the answer.] Problem 3.25 Find the potential outside an inﬁnitely long metal pipe, of radius R, placed at right angles to an otherwise uniform electric ﬁeld E0. Find the surface charge induced on the pipe. [Use your result from Prob. 3.24.] Problem 3.26 Charge density σ(φ) = a sin 5φ (where a is a constant) is glued over the surface of an inﬁnite cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.25). Find the potential inside and outside the cylinder.

We have often used this as a check on formulas for V . But what if Q is zero? You might reply that the potential is then approximately zero, and of course, you’re right, in a sense (indeed, the potential at large r is pretty small even if Q is not zero). But we’re looking for something a bit more informative than that. Example 3.10. A (physical) electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges (±q) separated by a distance d. Find the approximate potential at points far from the dipole. Solution Let r− be the distance from −q and r+ the distance from +q (Fig. 3.26). Then V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ( q r+ − q r− ) , and (from the law of cosines) r 2 ± = r 2 + (d/2) 2 ∓ rd cos θ = r 2 ( 1 ∓ d r cos θ + d 2 4r 2 ) . We’re interested in the régime r ≫ d, so the third term is negligible, and the binomial expansion yields 1 r± ∼= 1 r ( 1 ∓ d r cos θ )−1/2 ∼= 1 r (1 ± d 2r cos θ ) . Thus 1 r+ − 1 r− ∼= d r 2 cos θ, −q d +q θ r r+ r− FIGURE 3.26 152 Chapter 3 Potentials and hence V (r) ∼= 1 4πϵ0 qd cos θ r 2 . (3.90) The potential of a dipole goes like 1/r 2 at large r ; as we might have anticipated, it falls off more rapidly than the potential of a point charge. If we put together a pair of equal and opposite dipoles to make a quadrupole, the potential goes like 1/r 3; for back-to-back quadrupoles (an octopole), it goes like 1/r 4; and so on. Figure 3.27 summarizes this hierarchy; for completeness I have included the electric monopole (point charge), whose potential, of course, goes like 1/r . − − − −+ + + + + +− −+ +− Quadrupole (V ~ 1/r3) Octopole (V ~ 1/r4) Monopole (V ~ 1/r) Dipole (V ~ 1/r2) FIGURE 3.27 Example 3.10 pertains to a very special charge conﬁguration. I propose now to develop a systematic expansion for the potential of any localized charge distribu- tion, in powers of 1/r . Figure 3.28 deﬁnes the relevant variables; the potential at r is given by V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 √ 1 r ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝. (3.91) Using the law of cosines, r 2 = r 2 + (r ⃝)2 − 2rr ⃝ cos α = r 2 [ 1 + ( r ⃝ r )2 − 2 ( r ⃝ r ) cos α ] , where α is the angle between r and r ⃝. Thus r = r √ 1 + ϵ, (3.92) dτ′ r rr′ P α FIGURE 3.28 3.4 Multipole Expansion 153 with ϵ ≡ (r ⃝ r )(r ⃝ r − 2 cos α) . For points well outside the charge distribution, ϵ is much less than 1, and this invites a binomial expansion: 1 r = 1 r (1 + ϵ)−1/2 = 1 r (1 − 1 2 ϵ + 3 8 ϵ2 − 5 16 ϵ3 + ...) , (3.93) or, in terms of r , r ⃝, and α: 1 r = 1 r [ 1 − 1 2 (r ⃝ r )(r ⃝ r − 2 cos α) + 3 8 (r ⃝ r )2 (r ⃝ r − 2 cos α)2 − 5 16 (r ⃝ r )3 (r ⃝ r − 2 cos α)3 + ... ] = 1 r [ 1 + (r ⃝ r ) (cos α) + (r ⃝ r )2 ( 3 cos2 α − 1 2 ) + ( r ⃝ r )3 ( 5 cos3 α − 3 cos α 2 ) + ... ] . In the last step, I have collected together like powers of (r ⃝/r ); surprisingly, their coefﬁcients (the terms in parentheses) are Legendre polynomials! The remarkable result 16 is that 1 r = 1 r ∞∑ n=0 (r ⃝ r )n Pn(cos α). (3.94) Substituting this back into Eq. 3.91, and noting that r is a constant, as far as the integration is concerned, I conclude that V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∞∑ n=0 1 r (n+1) √ (r ⃝)n Pn(cos α)ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝, (3.95) or, more explicitly, V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 [ 1 r √ ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝ + 1 r 2 √ r ⃝ cos αρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝ + 1 r 3 √ (r ⃝)2 ( 3 2 cos2 α − 1 2 ) ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝ + ...] . (3.96) 16This suggests a second way of deﬁning the Legendre polynomials (the ﬁrst being Rodrigues’ for- mula); 1/r is called the generating function for Legendre polynomials. 154 Chapter 3 Potentials This is the desired result—the multipole expansion of V in powers of 1/r . The ﬁrst term (n = 0) is the monopole contribution (it goes like 1/r ); the sec- ond (n = 1) is the dipole (it goes like 1/r 2); the third is quadrupole; the fourth octopole; and so on. Remember that α is the angle between r and r ⃝, so the inte- grals depend on the direction to the ﬁeld point. If you are interested in the poten- tial along the z⃝ axis (or—putting it the other way around—if you orient your r ⃝ coordinates so the z⃝ axis lies along r), then α is the usual polar angle θ ⃝. As it stands, Eq. 3.95 is exact, but it is useful primarily as an approxima- tion scheme: the lowest nonzero term in the expansion provides the approximate potential at large r , and the successive terms tell us how to improve the approxi- mation if greater precision is required. Problem 3.27 A sphere of radius R, centered at the origin, carries charge density ρ(r,θ ) = k R r 2 (R − 2r ) sin θ, where k is a constant, and r , θ are the usual spherical coordinates. Find the approx- imate potential for points on the z axis, far from the sphere. Problem 3.28 A circular ring in the xy plane (radius R, centered at the origin) carries a uniform line charge λ. Find the ﬁrst three terms (n = 0, 1, 2) in the multipole expansion for V (r,θ ). 3.4.2 The Monopole and Dipole Terms Ordinarily, the multipole expansion is dominated (at large r ) by the monopole term: Vmon(r) = 1 4πϵ0 Q r , (3.97) where Q = ∫ ρ dτ is the total charge of the conﬁguration. This is just what we expect for the approximate potential at large distances from the charge. For a point charge at the origin, Vmon is the exact potential, not merely a ﬁrst approximation at large r ; in this case, all the higher multipoles vanish. If the total charge is zero, the dominant term in the potential will be the dipole (unless, of course, it also vanishes): Vdip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r 2 √ r ⃝ cos αρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝. Since α is the angle between r ⃝ and r (Fig. 3.28), r ⃝ cos α = ˆr · r ⃝, and the dipole potential can be written more succinctly: Vdip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r 2 ˆr · √ r ⃝ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝. 3.4 Multipole Expansion 155 This integral (which does not depend on r) is called the dipole moment of the distribution: p ≡ √ r ⃝ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝, (3.98) and the dipole contribution to the potential simpliﬁes to Vdip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 p · ˆr r 2 . (3.99) The dipole moment is determined by the geometry (size, shape, and density) of the charge distribution. Equation 3.98 translates in the usual way (Sect. 2.1.4) for point, line, and surface charges. Thus, the dipole moment of a collection of point charges is p = n∑ i=1 qi r ⃝ i . (3.100) For a physical dipole (equal and opposite charges, ±q), p = qr ⃝ + − qr ⃝ − = q(r ⃝ + − r ⃝ −) = qd, (3.101) where d is the vector from the negative charge to the positive one (Fig. 3.29). Is this consistent with what we got in Ex. 3.10? Yes: If you put Eq. 3.101 into Eq. 3.99, you recover Eq. 3.90. Notice, however, that this is only the approximate potential of the physical dipole—evidently there are higher multipole contribu- tions. Of course, as you go farther and farther away, Vdip becomes a better and better approximation, since the higher terms die off more rapidly with increas- ing r . By the same token, at a ﬁxed r the dipole approximation improves as you shrink the separation d. To construct a perfect (point) dipole whose potential is given exactly by Eq. 3.99, you’d have to let d approach zero. Unfortunately, you then lose the dipole term too, unless you simultaneously arrange for q to go to in- ﬁnity! A physical dipole becomes a pure dipole, then, in the rather artiﬁcial limit d → 0, q →∞, with the product qd = p held ﬁxed. When someone uses the word “dipole,” you can’t always tell whether they mean a physical dipole (with y z x +q −q r′− r′+ d FIGURE 3.29 156 Chapter 3 Potentials +q −q −q +q FIGURE 3.30 ﬁnite separation between the charges) or an ideal (point) dipole. If in doubt, as- sume that d is small enough (compared to r ) that you can safely apply Eq. 3.99. Dipole moments are vectors, and they add accordingly: if you have two dipoles, p1 and p2, the total dipole moment is p1 + p2. For instance, with four charges at the corners of a square, as shown in Fig. 3.30, the net dipole moment is zero. You can see this by combining the charges in pairs (vertically, ↓+↑ = 0, or horizontally, →+← = 0) or by adding up the four contributions individually, using Eq. 3.100. This is a quadrupole, as I indicated earlier, and its potential is dominated by the quadrupole term in the multipole expansion. Problem 3.29 Four particles (one of charge q, one of charge 3q, and two of charge −2q) are placed as shown in Fig. 3.31, each a distance a from the origin. Find a simple approximate formula for the potential, valid at points far from the origin. (Express your answer in spherical coordinates.) y 3q −2q−2q x z q a a aa FIGURE 3.31 Problem 3.30 In Ex. 3.9, we derived the exact potential for a spherical shell of radius R, which carries a surface charge σ = k cos θ. (a) Calculate the dipole moment of this charge distribution. (b) Find the approximate potential, at points far from the sphere, and compare the exact answer (Eq. 3.87). What can you conclude about the higher multipoles? Problem 3.31 For the dipole in Ex. 3.10, expand 1/r± to order (d/r )3, and use this to determine the quadrupole and octopole terms in the potential. 3.4 Multipole Expansion 157 3.4.3 Origin of Coordinates in Multipole Expansions I mentioned earlier that a point charge at the origin constitutes a “pure” monopole. If it is not at the origin, it’s no longer a pure monopole. For instance, the charge in Fig. 3.32 has a dipole moment p = qd ˆy, and a corresponding dipole term in its potential. The monopole potential (1/4πϵ0)q/r is not quite correct for this conﬁguration; rather, the exact potential is (1/4πϵ0)q/r. The multipole expansion is, remember, a series in inverse powers of r (the distance to the origin), and when we expand 1/r, we get all powers, not just the ﬁrst. So moving the origin (or, what amounts to the same thing, moving the charge) can radically alter a multipole expansion. The monopole moment Q does not change, since the total charge is obviously independent of the coordinate system. (In Fig. 3.32, the monopole term was unaffected when we moved q away from the origin—it’s just that it was no longer the whole story: a dipole term—and for that matter all higher poles—appeared as well.) Ordinarily, the dipole moment does change when you shift the origin, but there is an important exception: If the total charge is zero, then the dipole moment is independent of the choice of origin. For suppose we displace the origin by an amount a (Fig. 3.33). The new dipole moment is then ¯p = √ ¯r ⃝ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝ = √ (r ⃝ − a)ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝ = √ r ⃝ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝ − a √ ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝ = p − Qa. y z x q d r r O FIGURE 3.32 x y x y a r′ r′ dτ′ FIGURE 3.33 In particular, if Q = 0, then ¯p = p. So if someone asks for the dipole moment in Fig. 3.34(a), you can answer with conﬁdence “qd,” but if you’re asked for the dipole moment in Fig. 3.34(b), the appropriate response would be “With respect to what origin?” (b)(a) −q −q q aa aqq d FIGURE 3.34 158 Chapter 3 Potentials Problem 3.32 Two point charges, 3q and −q, are separated by a distance a.For each of the arrangements in Fig. 3.35, ﬁnd (i) the monopole moment, (ii) the dipole moment, and (iii) the approximate potential (in spherical coordinates) at large r (include both the monopole and dipole contributions). y 3q −q −q a x z (a) y 3q a x z −q (b) y3qa x z (c) FIGURE 3.35 3.4.4 The Electric Field of a Dipole So far we have worked only with potentials. Now I would like to calculate the electric ﬁeld of a (perfect) dipole. If we choose coordinates so that p is at the origin and points in the z direction (Fig. 3.36), then the potential at r,θ is (Eq. 3.99): Vdip(r,θ ) = ˆr · p 4πϵ0r 2 = p cos θ 4πϵ0r 2 . (3.102) To get the ﬁeld, we take the negative gradient of V : Er =− ∂ V ∂r = 2 p cos θ 4πϵ0r 3 , Eθ =− 1 r ∂ V ∂θ = p sin θ 4πϵ0r 3 , Eφ =− 1 r sin θ ∂ V ∂φ = 0. Thus Edip(r,θ ) = p 4πϵ0r 3 (2 cos θ ˆr + sin θ ˆθ). (3.103) 3.4 Multipole Expansion 159 y z x p rθ φ FIGURE 3.36 This formula makes explicit reference to a particular coordinate system (spher- ical) and assumes a particular orientation for p (along z). It can be recast in a coordinate-free form, analogous to the potential in Eq. 3.99—see Prob. 3.36. Notice that the dipole ﬁeld falls off as the inverse cube of r ;the monopole ﬁeld (Q/4πϵ0r 2)ˆr goes as the inverse square, of course. Quadrupole ﬁelds go like 1/r 4, octopole like 1/r 5, and so on. (This merely reﬂects the fact that monopole potentials fall off like 1/r , dipole like 1/r 2, quadrupole like 1/r 3, and so on—the gradient introduces another factor of 1/r .) Figure 3.37(a) shows the ﬁeld lines of a “pure” dipole (Eq. 3.103). For com- parison, I have also sketched the ﬁeld lines for a “physical” dipole, in Fig. 3.37(b). Notice how similar the two pictures become if you blot out the central region; up close, however, they are entirely different. Only for points r ≫ d does Eq. 3.103 represent a valid approximation to the ﬁeld of a physical dipole. As I mentioned earlier, this régime can be reached either by going to large r or by squeezing the charges very close together. 17 y z y z (a) Field of a “pure” dipole (b) Field of a “physical” dipole FIGURE 3.37 17Even in the limit, there remains an inﬁnitesimal region at the origin where the ﬁeld of a physical dipole points in the “wrong” direction, as you can see by “walking” down the z axis in Fig. 3.35(b). If you want to explore this subtle and important point, work Prob. 3.48. 160 Chapter 3 Potentials Problem 3.33 A “pure” dipole p is situated at the origin, pointing in the z direction. (a) What is the force on a point charge q at (a, 0, 0) (Cartesian coordinates)? (b) What is the force on q at (0, 0, a)? (c) How much work does it take to move q from (a, 0, 0) to (0, 0, a)? Problem 3.34 Three point charges are located as shown in Fig. 3.38, each a distance a from the origin. Find the approximate electric ﬁeld at points far from the origin. Express your answer in spherical coordinates, and include the two lowest orders in the multipole expansion. y q −q−q x z aa a FIGURE 3.38 Problem 3.35 A solid sphere, radius R, is centered at the origin. The “northern” hemisphere carries a uniform charge density ρ0, and the “southern” hemisphere a uniform charge density −ρ0. Find the approximate ﬁeld E(r,θ ) for points far from the sphere (r ≫ R). Problem 3.36 Show that the electric ﬁeld of a (perfect) dipole (Eq. 3.103) can be• written in the coordinate-free form Edip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r 3 [3(p · ˆr)ˆr − p]. (3.104) More Problems on Chapter 3 Problem 3.37 In Section 3.1.4, I proved that the electrostatic potential at any point P in a charge-free region is equal to its average value over any spherical surface (radius R) centered at P. Here’s an alternative argument that does not rely on Coulomb’s law, only on Laplace’s equation. We might as well set the origin at P. Let Vave(R) be the average; ﬁrst show that dVave dR = 1 4π R2 ∮ ∇V · da (note that the R2 in da cancels the 1/R2 out front, so the only dependence on R is in V itself). Now use the divergence theorem, and conclude that if V satisﬁes Laplace’s equation, then Vave(R) = Vave(0) = V (P), for all R.18 18I thank Ted Jacobson for suggesting this proof. 3.4 Multipole Expansion 161 Problem 3.38 Here’s an alternative derivation of Eq. 3.10 (the surface charge den- sity induced on a grounded conducted plane by a point charge q a distance d above the plane). This approach 19 (which generalizes to many other problems) does not rely on the method of images. The total ﬁeld is due in part to q, and in part to the induced surface charge. Write down the z components of these ﬁelds—in terms of q and the as-yet-unknown σ(x, y)—just below the surface. The sum must be zero, of course, because this is inside a conductor. Use that to determine σ . Problem 3.39 Two inﬁnite parallel grounded conducting planes are held a distance a apart. A point charge q is placed in the region between them, a distance x from one plate. Find the force on q. 20 Check that your answer is correct for the special cases a →∞ and x = a/2. Problem 3.40 Two long straight wires, carrying opposite uniform line charges ±λ, are situated on either side of a long conducting cylinder (Fig. 3.39). The cylinder (which carries no net charge) has radius R, and the wires are a distance a from the axis. Find the potential. [ Answer: V (s,φ) = λ 4πϵ0 ln { (s2 + a2 + 2sa cos φ)[(sa/R)2 + R2 − 2sa cos φ] (s2 + a2 − 2sa cos φ)[(sa/R)2 + R2 + 2sa cos φ] }] R λ−λ a s r a φ FIGURE 3.39 Problem 3.41 Buckminsterfullerine is a molecule of 60 carbon atoms arranged like the stitching on a soccer-ball. It may be approximated as a conducting spher- ical shell of radius R = 3.5 Å. A nearby electron would be attracted, according to Prob. 3.9, so it is not surprising that the ion C− 60 exists. (Imagine that the electron— on average—smears itself out uniformly over the surface.) But how about a second electron? At large distances it would be repelled by the ion, obviously, but at a cer- tain distance r (from the center), the net force is zero, and closer than this it would be attracted. So an electron with enough energy to get in that close should bind. (a) Find r , in Å. [You’ll have to do it numerically.] (b) How much energy (in electron volts) would it take to push an electron in (from inﬁnity) to the point r ? [Incidentally, the C−− 60 ion has been observed.]21 19See J. L. R. Marrero, Am.J.Phys. 78, 639 (2010). 20Obtaining the induced surface charge is not so easy. See B. G. Dick, Am.J.Phys. 41, 1289 (1973), M. Zahn, Am.J.Phys. 44, 1132 (1976), J. Pleines and S. Mahajan, Am.J.Phys. 45, 868 (1977), and Prob. 3.51 below. 21Richard Mawhorter suggested this problem. 162 Chapter 3 Potentials Problem 3.42 You can use the superposition principle to combine solutions obtained by separation of variables. For example, in Prob. 3.16 you found the potential inside a cubical box, if ﬁve faces are grounded and the sixth is at a con- stant potential V0; by a six-fold superposition of the result, you could obtain the potential inside a cube with the faces maintained at speciﬁed constant voltages V1, V2, ... V6. In this way, using Ex. 3.4 and Prob. 3.15, ﬁnd the potential inside a rectangular pipe with two facing sides (x =±b) at potential V0, a third (y = a) at V1,and thelast(at y = 0) grounded. Problem 3.43 A conducting sphere of radius a, at potential V0, is surrounded by a thin concentric spherical shell of radius b, over which someone has glued a surface charge σ(θ ) = k cos θ, where k is a constant and θ is the usual spherical coordinate. (a) Find the potential in each region: (i) r > b, and (ii) a < r < b. (b) Find the induced surface charge σi (θ) on the conductor. (c) What is the total charge of this system? Check that your answer is consistent with the behavior of V at large r . ⎡ ⎣Answer: V (r,θ ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ aV0/r + (b3 − a3)k cos θ/3r 2ϵ0, r ≥ b aV0/r + (r 3 − a3)k cos θ/3r 2ϵ0, r ≤ b ⎤ ⎦ Problem 3.44 Acharge +Q is distributed uniformly along the z axis from z =−a to z =+a. Show that the electric potential at a point r is given by V (r,θ ) = Q 4πϵ0 1 r [1 + 1 3 ( a r )2 P2(cos θ) + 1 5 ( a r )4 P4(cos θ) + ...] , for r > a. Problem 3.45 A long cylindrical shell of radius R carries a uniform surface charge σ0 on the upper half and an opposite charge −σ0 on the lower half (Fig. 3.40). Find the electric potential inside and outside the cylinder. y R x σ0 −σ0 FIGURE 3.40 3.4 Multipole Expansion 163 Problem 3.46 A thin insulating rod, running from z =−a to z =+a, carries the indicated line charges. In each case, ﬁnd the leading term in the multipole expansion of the potential: (a) λ = k cos(π z/2a),(b) λ = k sin(π z/a),(c) λ = k cos(π z/a), where k is a constant. Problem 3.47 Show that the average ﬁeld inside a sphere of radius R, due to all the• charge within the sphere, is Eave =− 1 4πϵ0 p R3 , (3.105) where p is the total dipole moment. There are several ways to prove this delightfully simple result. Here’s one method:22 (a) Show that the average ﬁeld due to a single charge q at point r inside the sphere is the same as the ﬁeld at r due to a uniformly charged sphere with ρ =−q/( 4 3 π R3),namely 1 4πϵ0 1 ( 4 3 π R3) √ q r2 ˆr dτ ⃝, where r is the vector from r to dτ ⃝. (b) The latter can be found from Gauss’s law (see Prob. 2.12). Express the answer in terms of the dipole moment of q. (c) Use the superposition principle to generalize to an arbitrary charge distribution. (d) While you’re at it, show that the average ﬁeld over the volume of a sphere, due to all the charges outside, is the same as the ﬁeld they produce at the center. Problem 3.48 (a) Using Eq. 3.103, calculate the average electric ﬁeld of a dipole, over a spher- ical volume of radius R, centered at the origin. Do the angular integrals ﬁrst. [Note: You must express ˆr and ˆθ in terms of ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz (see back cover) before integrating. If you don’t understand why, reread the discussion in Sect. 1.4.1.] Compare your answer with the general theorem (Eq. 3.105). The discrepancy here is related to the fact that the ﬁeld of a dipole blows up at r = 0. The angular integral is zero, but the radial integral is inﬁnite, so we really don’t know what to make of the answer. To resolve this dilemma, let’s say that Eq. 3.103 applies outside a tiny sphere of radius ϵ—its contribution to Eave is then unambiguously zero, and the whole answer has to come from the ﬁeld inside the ϵ-sphere. (b) What must the ﬁeld inside the ϵ-sphere be, in order for the general theorem (Eq. 3.105) to hold? [Hint: since ϵ is arbitrarily small, we’re talking about some- thing that is inﬁnite at r = 0 and whose integral over an inﬁnitesimal volume is ﬁnite.] [Answer: −(p/3ϵ0)δ3(r)] Evidently, the true ﬁeld of a dipole is Edip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r 3 [3(p · ˆr)ˆr − p]− 1 3ϵ0 p δ3(r). (3.106) 22Another method exploits the result of Prob. 3.4. See B. Y.-K. Hu, Eur. J. Phys. 30, L29 (2009). 164 Chapter 3 Potentials You may wonder how we missed the delta-function term23 when we calculated the ﬁeld back in Sect. 3.4.4. The answer is that the differentiation leading to Eq. 3.103 is valid except at r = 0, but we should have known (from our experience in Sect. 1.5.1) that the point r = 0 would be problematic.24 Problem 3.49 In Ex. 3.9, we obtained the potential of a spherical shell with surface charge σ(θ ) = k cos θ . In Prob. 3.30, you found that the ﬁeld is pure dipole out- side; it’s uniform inside (Eq. 3.86). Show that the limit R → 0 reproduces the delta function term in Eq. 3.106. Problem 3.50 (a) Suppose a charge distribution ρ1(r) produces a potential V1(r), and some other charge distribution ρ2(r) produces a potential V2(r). [The two situations may have nothing in common, for all I care—perhaps number 1 is a uniformly charged sphere and number 2 is a parallel-plate capacitor. Please understand that ρ1 and ρ2 are not present at the same time; we are talking about two differ- ent problems, one in which only ρ1 is present, and another in which only ρ2 is present.] Prove Green’s reciprocity theorem:25 √ all space ρ1V2 dτ = √ all space ρ2V1 dτ. [Hint: Evaluate ∫ E1 · E2 dτ two ways, ﬁrst writing E1 =−∇V1 and using in- tegration by parts to transfer the derivative to E2, then writing E2 =−∇V2 and transferring the derivative to E1.] (b) Suppose now that you have two separated conductors (Fig. 3.41). If you charge up conductor a by amount Q (leaving b uncharged), the resulting potential of b is, say, Vab. On the other hand, if you put that same charge Q on conductor b (leaving a uncharged), the potential of a would be Vba. Use Green’s reciprocity theoremtoshowthat Vab = Vba (an astonishing result, since we assumed noth- ing about the shapes or placement of the conductors). ab Q V FIGURE 3.41 23There are other ways of getting the delta-function term in the ﬁeld of a dipole—my own favorite is Prob. 3.49. Note that unless you are right on top of the dipole, Eq. 3.104 is perfectly adequate. 24See C. P. Frahm, Am.J.Phys. 51, 826 (1983). For applications, see D. J. Grifﬁths, Am.J.Phys. 50, 698 (1982). There are other (perhaps preferable) ways of expressing the contact (delta-function) term in Eq. 3.106; see A. Gsponer, Eur. J. Phys. 28, 267 (2007), J. Franklin, Am. J. Phys. 78, 1225 (2010), and V. Hnizdo, Eur. J. Phys. 32, 287 (2011). 25For interesting commentary, see B. Y.-K. Hu, Am.J.Phys. 69, 1280 (2001). 3.4 Multipole Expansion 165 Problem 3.51 Use Green’s reciprocity theorem (Prob. 3.50) to solve the following two problems. [Hint: for distribution 1, use the actual situation; for distribution 2, remove q, and set one of the conductors at potential V0.] (a) Both plates of a parallel-plate capacitor are grounded, and a point charge q is placed between them at a distance x from plate 1. The plate separation is d. Find the induced charge on each plate. [Answer: Q1 = q(x/d − 1); Q2 =−qx/d] (b) Two concentric spherical conducting shells (radii a and b) are grounded, and a point charge q is placed between them (at radius r ). Find the induced charge on each sphere. Problem 3.52 (a) Show that the quadrupole term in the multipole expansion can be written Vquad(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r 3 3∑ i, j=1 ˆri ˆr j Qij (in the notation of Eq. 1.31), where Qij ≡ 1 2 √ [3r ⃝ i r ⃝ j − (r ⃝)2δij ]ρ(r ⃝) dτ ⃝. Here δij = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1if i = j 0if i ̸= j is the Kronecker delta,and Qij is the quadrupole moment of the charge distribution. Notice the hierarchy: Vmon = 1 4πϵ0 Q r ; Vdip = 1 4πϵ0 ∑ ˆri pi r 2 ; Vquad = 1 4πϵ0 ∑ ˆri ˆr j Qij r 3 ; ... The monopole moment (Q) is a scalar, the dipole moment (p) is a vector, the quadrupole moment (Qij ) is a second-rank tensor, and so on. (b) Find all nine components of Qij for the conﬁguration in Fig. 3.30 (assume the square has side a and lies in the xy plane, centered at the origin). (c) Show that the quadrupole moment is independent of origin if the monopole and dipole moments both vanish. (This works all the way up the hierarchy—the lowest nonzero multipole moment is always independent of origin.) (d) How would you deﬁne the octopole moment? Express the octopole term in the multipole expansion in terms of the octopole moment. Problem 3.53 In Ex. 3.8 we determined the electric ﬁeld outside a spherical conduc- tor (radius R) placed in a uniform external ﬁeld E0.

CHAPTER 4 Electric Fields in Matter 4.1 POLARIZATION 4.1.1 Dielectrics In this chapter, we shall study electric ﬁelds in matter. Matter, of course, comes in many varieties—solids, liquids, gases, metals, woods, glasses—and these sub- stances do not all respond in the same way to electrostatic ﬁelds. Nevertheless, most everyday objects belong (at least, in good approximation) to one of two large classes: conductors and insulators (or dielectrics). We have already talked about conductors; these are substances that contain an “unlimited” supply of charges that are free to move about through the material. In practice, what this ordinarily means is that many of the electrons (one or two per atom, in a typical metal) are not associated with any particular nucleus, but roam around at will. In dielectrics, by contrast, all charges are attached to speciﬁc atoms or molecules—they’re on a tight leash, and all they can do is move a bit within the atom or molecule. Such microscopic displacements are not as dramatic as the wholesale rearrangement of charge in a conductor, but their cumulative effects account for the characteris- tic behavior of dielectric materials. There are actually two principal mechanisms by which electric ﬁelds can distort the charge distribution of a dielectric atom or molecule: stretching and rotating. In the next two sections I’ll discuss these processes. 4.1.2 Induced Dipoles What happens to a neutral atom when it is placed in an electric ﬁeld E? Your ﬁrst guess might well be: “Absolutely nothing—since the atom is not charged, the ﬁeld has no effect on it.” But that is incorrect. Although the atom as a whole is electrically neutral, there is a positively charged core (the nucleus) and a nega- tively charged electron cloud surrounding it. These two regions of charge within the atom are inﬂuenced by the ﬁeld: the nucleus is pushed in the direction of the ﬁeld, and the electrons the opposite way. In principle, if the ﬁeld is large enough, it can pull the atom apart completely, “ionizing” it (the substance then becomes a conductor). With less extreme ﬁelds, however, an equilibrium is soon estab- lished, for if the center of the electron cloud does not coincide with the nucleus, these positive and negative charges attract one another, and that holds the atom together. The two opposing forces—E pulling the electrons and nucleus apart, their mutual attraction drawing them back together—reach a balance, leaving the 167 168 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter H He Li Be C Ne Na Ar K Cs 0.667 0.205 24.3 5.60 1.67 0.396 24.1 1.64 43.4 59.4 TABLE 4.1 Atomic Polarizabilities (α/4πϵ0, in units of 10−30 m 3).

The atom now has a tiny dipole moment p, which points in the same direction as E. Typically, this induced dipole moment is approximately proportional to the ﬁeld (as long as the latter is not too strong): p = αE. (4.1) The constant of proportionality α is called atomic polarizability. Its value depends on the detailed structure of the atom in question. Table 4.1 lists some experimentally determined atomic polarizabilities. Example 4.1. A primitive model for an atom consists of a point nucleus (+q) surrounded by a uniformly charged spherical cloud (−q) of radius a (Fig. 4.1). Calculate the atomic polarizability of such an atom. −q +q a FIGURE 4.1 −q d E +q FIGURE 4.2 Solution In the presence of an external ﬁeld E, the nucleus will be shifted slightly to the right and the electron cloud to the left, as shown in Fig. 4.2. (Because the actual displacements involved are extremely small, as you’ll see in Prob. 4.1, it is rea- sonable to assume that the electron cloud retains its spherical shape.) Say that equilibrium occurs when the nucleus is displaced a distance d from the center of the sphere. At that point, the external ﬁeld pushing the nucleus to the right exactly balances the internal ﬁeld pulling it to the left: E = Ee, where Ee is the ﬁeld pro- duced by the electron cloud. Now the ﬁeld at a distance d from the center of a uniformly charged sphere is Ee = 1 4πϵ0 qd a3 (Prob. 2.12). At equilibrium, then, E = 1 4πϵ0 qd a3 , or p = qd = (4πϵ0a3)E. 4.1 Polarization 169 The atomic polarizability is therefore α = 4πϵ0a3 = 3ϵ0v, (4.2) where v is the volume of the atom. Although this atomic model is extremely crude, the result (Eq. 4.2) is not too bad—it’s accurate to within a factor of four or so for many simple atoms. For molecules the situation is not quite so simple, because frequently they polarize more readily in some directions than in others. Carbon dioxide (Fig. 4.3), for instance, has a polarizability of 4.5 × 10 −40 C2·m/N when you apply the ﬁeld along the axis of the molecule, but only 2 × 10 −40 for ﬁelds perpendicular to this direction. When the ﬁeld is at some angle to the axis, you must resolve it into parallel and perpendicular components, and multiply each by the pertinent polarizability: p = α⊥E⊥ + α˙E˙. In this case, the induced dipole moment may not even be in the same direction as E.And CO2 is relatively simple, as molecules go, since the atoms at least arrange themselves in a straight line; for a completely asymmetrical molecule, Eq. 4.1 is replaced by the most general linear relation between E and p: px = αxx Ex + αxy E y + αxz Ez py = αyx Ex + αyy E y + αyz Ez pz = αzx Ex + αzy E y + αzz Ez ⎫ ⎪⎬ ⎪⎭ (4.3) O C O FIGURE 4.3 The set of nine constants αij constitute the polarizability tensor for the molecule. Their values depend on the orientation of the axes you use, though it is always possible to choose “principal” axes such that all the off-diagonal terms (αxy, αzx , etc.) vanish, leaving just three nonzero polarizabilities: αxx , αyy, and αzz. Problem 4.1 A hydrogen atom (with the Bohr radius of half an angstrom) is situated between two metal plates 1 mm apart, which are connected to opposite terminals of a 500 V battery. What fraction of the atomic radius does the separation distance d amount to, roughly? Estimate the voltage you would need with this apparatus to ionize the atom. [Use the value of α in Table 4.1. Moral: The displacements we’re talking about are minute, even on an atomic scale.] 170 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter Problem 4.2 According to quantum mechanics, the electron cloud for a hydrogen atom in the ground state has a charge density ρ(r ) = q πa3 e−2r/a, where q is the charge of the electron and a is the Bohr radius. Find the atomic polarizability of such an atom. [Hint: First calculate the electric ﬁeld of the electron cloud, Ee(r ); then expand the exponential, assuming r ; a.1 Problem 4.3 According to Eq. 4.1, the induced dipole moment of an atom is pro- portional to the external ﬁeld. This is a “rule of thumb,” not a fundamental law, and it is easy to concoct exceptions—in theory. Suppose, for example, the charge density of the electron cloud were proportional to the distance from the center, out to a radius R. To what power of E would p be proportional in that case? Find the condition on ρ(r ) such that Eq. 4.1 will hold in the weak-ﬁeld limit. Problem 4.4 A point charge q is situated a large distance r from a neutral atom of polarizability α. Find the force of attraction between them. 4.1.3 Alignment of Polar Molecules The neutral atom discussed in Sect. 4.1.2 had no dipole moment to start with—p was induced by the applied ﬁeld. Some molecules have built-in, permanent dipole moments. In the water molecule, for example, the electrons tend to cluster around the oxygen atom (Fig. 4.4), and since the molecule is bent at 105 ◦, this leaves a negative charge at the vertex and a net positive charge on the opposite side. (The dipole moment of water is unusually large: 6.1 × 10 −30 C·m; in fact, this is what accounts for its effectiveness as a solvent.) What happens when such molecules (called polar molecules) are placed in an electric ﬁeld? If the ﬁeld is uniform, the force on the positive end, F+ = qE, exactly cancels the force on the negative end, F− =−qE (Fig. 4.5). However, there will be a torque: N = (r+ × F+) + (r− × F−) = [ (d/2) × (qE) ] + [ (−d/2) × (−qE) ] = qd × E. H+ P O− H+ 105º FIGURE 4.4 +q −q F + E F − O d FIGURE 4.5 1For a more sophisticated approach, see W. A. Bowers, Am.J.Phys. 54, 347 (1986). 4.1 Polarization 171 Thus a dipole p = qd in a uniform ﬁeld E experiences a torque N = p × E. (4.4) Notice that N is in such a direction as to line p up parallel to E; a polar molecule that is free to rotate will swing around until it points in the direction of the applied ﬁeld. If the ﬁeld is nonuniform, so that F+ does not exactly balance F−, there will be a net force on the dipole, in addition to the torque. Of course, E must change rather abruptly for there to be signiﬁcant variation in the space of one molecule, so this is not ordinarily a major consideration in discussing the behavior of dielectrics. Nevertheless, the formula for the force on a dipole in a nonuniform ﬁeld is of some interest: F = F+ + F− = q(E+ − E−) = q(<E), where <E represents the difference between the ﬁeld at the plus end and the ﬁeld at the minus end. Assuming the dipole is very short, we may use Eq. 1.35 to approximate the small change in Ex : <Ex ≡ (∇ Ex ) · d, with corresponding formulas for E y and Ez. More compactly, <E = (d · ∇)E, and therefore 2 F = (p · ∇)E. (4.5) For a “perfect” dipole of inﬁnitesimal length, Eq. 4.4 gives the torque about the center of the dipole even in a nonuniform ﬁeld; about any other point N = (p × E) + (r × F). Problem 4.5 In Fig. 4.6, p1 and p2 are (perfect) dipoles a distance r apart. What is the torque on p1 due to p2? What is the torque on p2 due to p1? [In each case, I want the torque on the dipole about its own center. If it bothers you that the answers are not equal and opposite, see Prob. 4.29.] p1 p2 r FIGURE 4.6 p z θ FIGURE 4.7 2In the present context, Eq. 4.5 could be written more conveniently as F = ∇(p · E).However,itis safer to stick with (p · ∇)E, because we will be applying the formula to materials in which the dipole moment (per unit volume) is itself a function of position and this second expression would imply (incorrectly) that p too is to be differentiated. 172 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter Problem 4.6 A (perfect) dipole p is situated a distance z above an inﬁnite grounded conducting plane (Fig. 4.7). The dipole makes an angle θ with the perpendicular to the plane. Find the torque on p. If the dipole is free to rotate, in what orientation will it come to rest? Problem 4.7 Show that the energy of an ideal dipole p in an electric ﬁeld E is given by U =−p · E. (4.6) Problem 4.8 Show that the interaction energy of two dipoles separated by a dis- placement r is U = 1 4πϵ0 1 r 3 [p1 · p2 − 3(p1 · ˆr)(p2 · ˆr)]. (4.7) [Hint: Use Prob. 4.7 and Eq. 3.104.] Problem 4.9 A dipole p is a distance r from a point charge q, and oriented so that p makes an angle θ with the vector r from q to p. (a) What is the force on p? (b) What is the force on q? 4.1.4 Polarization In the previous two sections, we have considered the effect of an external elec- tric ﬁeld on an individual atom or molecule. We are now in a position to answer (qualitatively) the original question: What happens to a piece of dielectric material when it is placed in an electric ﬁeld? If the substance consists of neutral atoms (or nonpolar molecules), the ﬁeld will induce in each a tiny dipole moment, pointing in the same direction as the ﬁeld. 3 If the material is made up of polar molecules, each permanent dipole will experience a torque, tending to line it up along the ﬁeld direction. (Random thermal motions compete with this process, so the align- ment is never complete, especially at higher temperatures, and disappears almost at once when the ﬁeld is removed.) Notice that these two mechanisms produce the same basic result: a lot of little dipoles pointing along the direction of the ﬁeld—the material becomes polarized. A convenient measure of this effect is P ≡ dipole moment per unit volume, which is called the polarization. From now on we shall not worry much about how the polarization got there. Actually, the two mechanisms I described are not as clear-cut as I tried to pretend. Even in polar molecules there will be 3In asymmetric molecules, the induced dipole moment may not be parallel to the ﬁeld, but if the molecules are randomly oriented, the perpendicular contributions will average to zero. Within a single crystal, the orientations are certainly not random, and we would have to treat this case separately. 4.2 The Field of a Polarized Object 173 some polarization by displacement (though generally it is a lot easier to rotate a molecule than to stretch it, so the second mechanism dominates). It’s even possi- ble in some materials to “freeze in” polarization, so that it persists after the ﬁeld is removed. But let’s forget for a moment about the cause of the polarization, and let’s study the ﬁeld that a chunk of polarized material itself produces. Then, in Sect. 4.3, we’ll put it all together: the original ﬁeld, which was responsible for P, plus the new ﬁeld, which is due to P. 4.2 THE FIELD OF A POLARIZED OBJECT 4.2.1 Bound Charges Suppose we have a piece of polarized material—that is, an object containing a lot of microscopic dipoles lined up. The dipole moment per unit volume P is given. Question: What is the ﬁeld produced by this object (not the ﬁeld that may have caused the polarization, but the ﬁeld the polarization itself causes)? Well, we know what the ﬁeld of an individual dipole looks like, so why not chop the material up into inﬁnitesimal dipoles and integrate to get the total? As usual, it’s easier to work with the potential. For a single dipole p (Eq. 3.99), V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 p · ˆr r2 , (4.8) where r is the vector from the dipole to the point at which we are evaluating the potential (Fig. 4.8). In the present context, we have a dipole moment p = P dτ ′ in each volume element dτ ′, so the total potential is V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ V P(r ′) · ˆr r2 dτ ′. (4.9) That does it, in principle. But a little sleight-of-hand casts this integral into a much more illuminating form. Observing that ∇′ ( 1 r ) = ˆr r2 , p r FIGURE 4.8 174 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter where (unlike Prob. 1.13) the differentiation is with respect to the source coordi- nates (r ′), we have V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ V P · ∇′ ( 1 r ) dτ ′. Integrating by parts, using product rule number 5 (in the front cover), gives V = 1 4πϵ0 ⎡ ⎣ ∫ V ∇′ · ( P r ) dτ ′ − ∫ V 1 r (∇′ · P) dτ ′ ⎤ ⎦ , or, invoking the divergence theorem, V = 1 4πϵ0 ∮ S 1 r P · da ′ − 1 4πϵ0 ∫ V 1 r (∇′ · P) dτ ′. (4.10) The ﬁrst term looks like the potential of a surface charge σb ≡ P · ˆn (4.11) (where ˆn is the normal unit vector), while the second term looks like the potential of a volume charge ρb ≡−∇ · P. (4.12) With these deﬁnitions, Eq. 4.10 becomes V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∮ S σb r da′ + 1 4πϵ0 ∫ V ρb r dτ ′. (4.13) What this means is that the potential (and hence also the ﬁeld) of a polarized object is the same as that produced by a volume charge density ρb =−∇ · P plus a surface charge density σb = P · ˆn. Instead of integrating the contributions of all the inﬁnitesimal dipoles, as in Eq. 4.9, we could ﬁrst ﬁnd those bound charges, and then calculate the ﬁelds they produce, in the same way we calculate the ﬁeld of any other volume and surface charges (for example, using Gauss’s law). Example 4.2. Find the electric ﬁeld produced by a uniformly polarized sphere of radius R. Solution We may as well choose the z axis to coincide with the direction of polarization (Fig. 4.9). The volume bound charge density ρb is zero, since P is uniform, but σb = P · ˆn = P cos θ, 4.2 The Field of a Polarized Object 175 P R z n θ FIGURE 4.9 where θ is the usual spherical coordinate. What we want, then, is the ﬁeld pro- duced by a charge density P cos θ plastered over the surface of a sphere. But we already computed the potential of such a conﬁguration, in Ex. 3.9: V (r,θ ) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎩ P 3ϵ0 r cos θ, for r ≤ R, P 3ϵ0 R3 r 2 cos θ, for r ≥ R. Since r cos θ = z,the ﬁeld inside the sphere is uniform: E =−∇V =− P 3ϵ0 ˆz =− 1 3ϵ0 P, for r < R. (4.14) This remarkable result will be very useful in what follows. Outside the sphere the potential is identical to that of a perfect dipole at the origin, V = 1 4πϵ0 p · ˆr r 2 , for r ≥ R, (4.15) FIGURE 4.10 176 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter whose dipole moment is, not surprisingly, equal to the total dipole moment of the sphere: p = 4 3 π R3P. (4.16) The ﬁeld of the uniformly polarized sphere is shown in Fig. 4.10. Problem 4.10 A sphere of radius R carries a polarization P(r) = kr, where k is a constant and r is the vector from the center. (a) Calculate the bound charges σb and ρb. (b) Find the ﬁeld inside and outside the sphere. Problem 4.11 A short cylinder, of radius a and length L, carries a “frozen-in” uni- form polarization P, parallel to its axis. Find the bound charge, and sketch the elec- tric ﬁeld (i) for L ≫ a, (ii) for L ; a, and (iii) for L ≈ a. [This is known as a bar electret; it is the electrical analog to a bar magnet. In practice, only very special materials—barium titanate is the most “familiar” example—will hold a permanent electric polarization. That’s why you can’t buy electrets at the toy store.] Problem 4.12 Calculate the potential of a uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2) directly from Eq. 4.9. 4.2.2 Physical Interpretation of Bound Charges In the last section we found that the ﬁeld of a polarized object is identical to the ﬁeld that would be produced by a certain distribution of “bound charges,” σb and ρb. But this conclusion emerged in the course of abstract manipulations on the integral in Eq. 4.9, and left us with no clue as to the physical meaning of these bound charges. Indeed, some authors give you the impression that bound charges are in some sense “ﬁctitious”—mere bookkeeping devices used to facilitate the calculation of ﬁelds. Nothing could be further from the truth: ρb and σb repre- sent perfectly genuine accumulations of charge. In this section I’ll explain how polarization leads to these charge distributions. The basic idea is very simple: Suppose we have a long string of dipoles, as shown in Fig. 4.11. Along the line, the head of one effectively cancels the tail of its neighbor, but at the ends there are two charges left over: plus at the right end and minus at the left. It is as if we had peeled off an electron at one end and carried it all the way down to the other end, though in fact no single electron made the whole trip—a lot of tiny displacements add up to one large one. We call the net charge at the ends a bound charge to remind ourselves that it cannot be removed; −+−+−+−+−+−+ − += FIGURE 4.11 4.2 The Field of a Polarized Object 177 −q +qA d = FIGURE 4.12 Aend A P n θ FIGURE 4.13 in a dielectric every electron is attached to a speciﬁc atom or molecule. But apart from that, bound charge is no different from any other kind. To calculate the actual amount of bound charge resulting from a given polar- ization, examine a “tube” of dielectric parallel to P. The dipole moment of the tiny chunk shown in Fig. 4.12 is P(Ad), where A is the cross-sectional area of the tube and d is the length of the chunk. In terms of the charge (q) at the end, this same dipole moment can be written qd. The bound charge that piles up at the right end of the tube is therefore q = PA. If the ends have been sliced off perpendicularly, the surface charge density is σb = q A = P. For an oblique cut (Fig. 4.13), the charge is still the same, but A = Aend cos θ ,so σb = q Aend = P cos θ = P · ˆn. The effect of the polarization, then, is to paint a bound charge σb = P · ˆn over the surface of the material. This is exactly what we found by more rigorous means in Sect. 4.2.1. But now we know where the bound charge comes from. If the polarization is nonuniform, we get accumulations of bound charge within the material, as well as on the surface. A glance at Fig. 4.14 suggests that a diverg- ing P results in a pileup of negative charge. Indeed, the net bound charge ∫ ρb dτ + ++ + + + + + − − − −− − −− FIGURE 4.14 178 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter in a given volume is equal and opposite to the amount that has been pushed out through the surface. The latter (by the same reasoning we used before) is P · ˆn per unit area, so ∫ V ρb dτ =− ∮ S P · da =− ∫ V (∇ · P) dτ. Since this is true for any volume, we have ρb =−∇ · P, conﬁrming, again, the more rigorous conclusion of Sect. 4.2.1. Example 4.3. There is another way of analyzing the uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2), which nicely illustrates the idea of a bound charge. What we have, really, is two spheres of charge: a positive sphere and a negative sphere. With- out polarization the two are superimposed and cancel completely. But when the material is uniformly polarized, all the plus charges move slightly upward (the z direction), and all the minus charges move slightly downward (Fig. 4.15). The two spheres no longer overlap perfectly: at the top there’s a “cap” of leftover pos- itive charge and at the bottom a cap of negative charge. This “leftover” charge is precisely the bound surface charge σb. + + −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−− + + + + + + + ++ + d + − FIGURE 4.15 In Prob. 2.18, you calculated the ﬁeld in the region of overlap between two uniformly charged spheres; the answer was E =− 1 4πϵ0 qd R3 , where q is the total charge of the positive sphere, d is the vector from the negative center to the positive center, and R is the radius of the sphere. We can express this in terms of the polarization of the sphere, p = qd = ( 4 3 π R3)P,as E =− 1 3ϵ0 P. 4.2 The Field of a Polarized Object 179 Meanwhile, for points outside, it is as though all the charge on each sphere were concentrated at the respective center. We have, then, a dipole, with potential V = 1 4πϵ0 p · ˆr r 2 . (Remember that d is some small fraction of an atomic radius; Fig. 4.15 is grossly exaggerated.) These answers agree, of course, with the results of Ex. 4.2. Problem 4.13 A very long cylinder, of radius a, carries a uniform polarization P perpendicular to its axis. Find the electric ﬁeld inside the cylinder. Show that the ﬁeld outside the cylinder can be expressed in the form E(r) = a2 2ϵ0s2 [2(P · ˆs)ˆs − P]. [Careful: I said “uniform,” not “radial”!] Problem 4.14 When you polarize a neutral dielectric, the charge moves a bit, but the total remains zero. This fact should be reﬂected in the bound charges σb and ρb. Prove from Eqs. 4.11 and 4.12 that the total bound charge vanishes. 4.2.3 The Field Inside a Dielectric 4 I have been sloppy about the distinction between “pure” dipoles and “physical” dipoles. In developing the theory of bound charges, I assumed we were working with the pure kind—indeed, I started with Eq. 4.8, the formula for the potential of a perfect dipole. And yet, an actual polarized dielectric consists of physical dipoles, albeit extremely tiny ones. What is more, I presumed to represent dis- crete molecular dipoles by a continuous density function P. How can I justify this method? Outside the dielectric there is no real problem: here we are far away from the molecules (r is many times greater than the separation distance between plus and minus charges), so the dipole potential dominates overwhelmingly and the detailed “graininess” of the source is blurred by distance. Inside the dielectric, however, we can hardly pretend to be far from all the dipoles, and the procedure I used in Sect. 4.2.1 is open to serious challenge. In fact, when you stop to think about it, the electric ﬁeld inside matter must be fantastically complicated, on the microscopic level. If you happen to be very near an electron, the ﬁeld is gigantic, whereas a short distance away it may be small or may point in a totally different direction. Moreover, an instant later, as the atoms move about, the ﬁeld will have altered entirely. This true microscopic ﬁeld would be utterly impossible to calculate, nor would it be of much interest if you could. Just as, for macroscopic purposes, we regard water as a continu- ous ﬂuid, ignoring its molecular structure, so also we can ignore the microscopic 4This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. 180 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter bumps and wrinkles in the electric ﬁeld inside matter, and concentrate on the macroscopic ﬁeld. This is deﬁned as the average ﬁeld over regions large enough to contain many thousands of atoms (so that the uninteresting microscopic ﬂuc- tuations are smoothed over), and yet small enough to ensure that we do not wash out any signiﬁcant large-scale variations in the ﬁeld. (In practice, this means we must average over regions much smaller than the dimensions of the object itself.) Ordinarily, the macroscopic ﬁeld is what people mean when they speak of “the” ﬁeld inside matter.5 It remains to show that the macroscopic ﬁeld is what we actually obtain when we use the methods of Sect. 4.2.1. The argument is subtle, so hang on. Sup- pose I want to calculate the macroscopic ﬁeld at some point r within a dielectric (Fig. 4.16). I know I must average the true (microscopic) ﬁeld over an appropriate volume, so let me draw a small sphere about r, of radius, say, a thousand times the size of a molecule. The macroscopic ﬁeld at r, then, consists of two parts: the average ﬁeld over the sphere due to all charges outside, plus the average due to all charges inside: E = Eout + Ein. You proved in Prob. 3.47(d) that the average ﬁeld (over a sphere), produced by charges outside, is equal to the ﬁeld they produce at the center, so Eout is the ﬁeld at r due to the dipoles exterior to the sphere. These are far enough away that we can safely use Eq. 4.9: Vout = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ outside P(r ′) · ˆr r2 dτ ′. (4.17) The dipoles inside the sphere are too close to treat in this fashion. But fortunately all we need is their average ﬁeld, and that, according to Eq. 3.105, is Ein =− 1 4πϵ0 p R3 , regardless of the details of the charge distribution within the sphere. The only relevant quantity is the total dipole moment, p = ( 4 3 π R3) P: Ein =− 1 3ϵ0 P. (4.18) r R FIGURE 4.16 5In case the notion of macroscopic ﬁelds sounds suspicious to you, let me point out that you do exactly the same averaging whenever you speak of the density of a material. 4.3 The Electric Displacement 181 Now, by assumption, the sphere is small enough that P does not vary signif- icantly over its volume, so the term left out of the integral in Eq. 4.17 corre- sponds to the ﬁeld at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere, to wit: −(1/3ϵ0)P (Eq. 4.14). But this is precisely what Ein (Eq. 4.18) puts back in! The macroscopic ﬁeld, then, is given by the potential V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ P(r ′) · ˆr r2 dτ ′, (4.19) where the integral runs over the entire volume of the dielectric. This is, of course, what we used in Sect. 4.2.1; without realizing it, we were correctly calculating the averaged, macroscopic ﬁeld, for points inside the dielectric. You may have to reread the last couple of paragraphs for the argument to sink in. Notice that it all revolves around the curious fact that the average ﬁeld over any sphere (due to the charge inside) is the same as the ﬁeld at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere with the same total dipole moment. This means that no matter how crazy the actual microscopic charge conﬁguration, we can replace it by a nice smooth distribution of perfect dipoles, if all we want is the macroscopic (average) ﬁeld. Incidentally, while the argument ostensibly relies on the spherical shape I chose to average over, the macroscopic ﬁeld is certainly independent of the geometry of the averaging region, and this is reﬂected in the ﬁnal answer, Eq. 4.19. Presumably one could reproduce the same argument for a cube or an ellipsoid or whatever—the calculation might be more difﬁcult, but the conclusion would be the same. 4.3 THE ELECTRIC DISPLACEMENT 4.3.1 Gauss’s Law in the Presence of Dielectrics In Sect. 4.2 we found that the effect of polarization is to produce accumulations of (bound) charge, ρb =−∇ · P within the dielectric and σb = P · ˆn on the surface. The ﬁeld due to polarization of the medium is just the ﬁeld of this bound charge. We are now ready to put it all together: the ﬁeld attributable to bound charge plus the ﬁeld due to everything else (which, for want of a better term, we call free charge, ρ f ). The free charge might consist of electrons on a conductor or ions embedded in the dielectric material or whatever; any charge, in other words, that is not a result of polarization. Within the dielectric, the total charge density can be written: ρ = ρb + ρ f , (4.20) and Gauss’s law reads ϵ0∇ · E = ρ = ρb + ρ f =−∇ · P + ρ f , where E is now the total ﬁeld, not just that portion generated by polarization. 182 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter It is convenient to combine the two divergence terms: ∇ · (ϵ0E + P) = ρ f . The expression in parentheses, designated by the letter D, D ≡ ϵ0E + P, (4.21) is known as the electric displacement. In terms of D, Gauss’s law reads ∇ · D = ρ f , (4.22) or, in integral form, ∮ D · da = Q fenc, (4.23) where Q fenc denotes the total free charge enclosed in the volume. This is a par- ticularly useful way to express Gauss’s law, in the context of dielectrics, because it makes reference only to free charges, and free charge is the stuff we control. Bound charge comes along for the ride: when we put the free charge in place, a certain polarization automatically ensues, by the mechanisms of Sect. 4.1, and this polarization produces the bound charge. In a typical problem, therefore, we know ρ f , but we do not (initially) know ρb; Eq. 4.23 lets us go right to work with the information at hand. In particular, whenever the requisite symmetry is present, we can immediately calculate D by the standard Gauss’s law methods. Example 4.4. A long straight wire, carrying uniform line charge λ, is surrounded by rubber insulation out to a radius a (Fig. 4.17). Find the electric displacement. s L Gaussian surface aλ FIGURE 4.17 Solution Drawing a cylindrical Gaussian surface, of radius s and length L, and applying Eq. 4.23, we ﬁnd D(2π sL) = λL . 4.3 The Electric Displacement 183 Therefore, D = λ 2π s ˆs. (4.24) Notice that this formula holds both within the insulation and outside it. In the latter region, P = 0, so E = 1 ϵ0 D = λ 2πϵ0s ˆs, for s > a. Inside the rubber, the electric ﬁeld cannot be determined, since we do not know P. It may appear to you that I left out the surface bound charge σb in deriving Eq. 4.22, and in a sense that is true. We cannot apply Gauss’s law precisely at the surface of a dielectric, for here ρb blows up,6 taking the divergence of E with it. But everywhere else the logic is sound, and in fact if we picture the edge of the dielectric as having some ﬁnite thickness, within which the polarization tapers off to zero (probably a more realistic model than an abrupt cut-off anyway), then there is no surface bound charge; ρb varies rapidly but smoothly within this “skin,” and Gauss’s law can be safely applied everywhere. At any rate, the integral form (Eq. 4.23) is free from this “defect.” Problem 4.15 A thick spherical shell (inner radius a, outer radius b)ismadeof dielectric material with a “frozen-in” polarization P(r) = k r ˆr, where k is a constant and r is the distance from the center (Fig. 4.18). (There is no free charge in the problem.) Find the electric ﬁeld in all three regions by two different methods: a bP P P P FIGURE 4.18 (a) Sphere (b) Needle (c) Wafer P FIGURE 4.19 6The polarization drops abruptly to zero outside the material, so its derivative is a delta function (see Prob. 1.46). The surface bound charge is precisely this term—in this sense it is actually included in ρb, but we ordinarily prefer to handle it separately as σb. 184 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter (a) Locate all the bound charge, and use Gauss’s law (Eq. 2.13) to calculate the ﬁeld it produces. (b) Use Eq. 4.23 to ﬁnd D, and then get E from Eq. 4.21. [Notice that the second method is much faster, and it avoids any explicit reference to the bound charges.] Problem 4.16 Suppose the ﬁeld inside a large piece of dielectric is E0, so that the electric displacement is D0 = ϵ0E0 + P. (a) Now a small spherical cavity (Fig. 4.19a) is hollowed out of the material. Find the ﬁeld at the center of the cavity in terms of E0 and P. Also ﬁnd the displace- ment at the center of the cavity in terms of D0 and P. Assume the polarization is “frozen in,” so it doesn’t change when the cavity is excavated. (b) Do the same for a long needle-shaped cavity running parallel to P (Fig. 4.19b). (c) Do the same for a thin wafer-shaped cavity perpendicular to P (Fig. 4.19c). Assume the cavities are small enough that P, E0,and D0 are essentially uniform. [Hint: Carving out a cavity is the same as superimposing an object of the same shape but opposite polarization.] 4.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel Equation 4.22 looks just like Gauss’s law, only the total charge density ρ is replaced by the free charge density ρ f , and D is substituted for ϵ0E. For this reason, you may be tempted to conclude that D is “just like” E (apart from the factor ϵ0), except that its source is ρ f instead of ρ: “To solve problems involving dielectrics, you just forget all about the bound charge—calculate the ﬁeld as you ordinarily would, only call the answer D instead of E.” This reasoning is seduc- tive, but the conclusion is false; in particular, there is no “Coulomb’s law” for D: D(r) ̸= 1 4π ∫ ˆr r2 ρ f (r ′) dτ ′. The parallel between E and D is more subtle than that. For the divergence alone is insufﬁcient to determine a vector ﬁeld; you need to know the curl as well. One tends to forget this in the case of electrostatic ﬁelds because the curl of E is always zero. But the curl of D is not always zero. ∇ × D = ϵ0(∇ × E) + (∇ × P) = ∇ × P, (4.25) and there is no reason, in general, to suppose that the curl of P vanishes. Some- times it does, as in Ex. 4.4 and Prob. 4.15, but more often it does not. The bar electret of Prob. 4.11 is a case in point: here there is no free charge any- where, so if you really believe that the only source of D is ρ f , you will be forced to conclude that D = 0 everywhere, and hence that E = (−1/ϵ0)P inside and E = 0 outside the electret, which is obviously wrong. (I leave it for you to ﬁnd the place where ∇ × P ̸= 0 in this problem.) Because ∇ × D ̸= 0, more- over, D cannot be expressed as the gradient of a scalar—there is no “potential” for D. 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 185 Advice: When you are asked to compute the electric displacement, ﬁrst look for symmetry. If the problem exhibits spherical, cylindrical, or plane symmetry, then you can get D directly from Eq. 4.23 by the usual Gauss’s law methods. (Evidently in such cases ∇ × P is automatically zero, but since symmetry alone dictates the answer, you’re not really obliged to worry about the curl.) If the requisite sym- metry is absent, you’ll have to think of another approach, and, in particular, you must not assume that D is determined exclusively by the free charge. 4.3.3 Boundary Conditions The electrostatic boundary conditions of Sect. 2.3.5 can be recast in terms of D. Equation 4.23 tells us the discontinuity in the component perpendicular to an interface: D⊥ above − D⊥ below = σ f , (4.26) while Eq. 4.25 gives the discontinuity in parallel components: D ˙ above − D ˙ below = P ˙ above − P ˙ below. (4.27) In the presence of dielectrics, these are sometimes more useful than the corre- sponding boundary conditions on E (Eqs. 2.31 and 2.32): E ⊥ above − E ⊥ below = 1 ϵ0 σ, (4.28) and E ˙ above − E ˙ below = 0. (4.29) You might try applying them, for example, to Probs. 4.16 and 4.17. Problem 4.17 For the bar electret of Prob. 4.11, make three careful sketches: one of P, one of E, and one of D. Assume L is about 2a.[Hint: E lines terminate on charges; D lines terminate on free charges.] 4.4 LINEAR DIELECTRICS 4.4.1 Susceptibility, Permittivity, Dielectric Constant In Sects. 4.2 and 4.3 we did not commit ourselves as to the cause of P; we dealt only with the effects of polarization. From the qualitative discussion of Sect. 4.1, though, we know that the polarization of a dielectric ordinarily results from an electric ﬁeld, which lines up the atomic or molecular dipoles. For many sub- stances, in fact, the polarization is proportional to the ﬁeld, provided E is not too strong: P = ϵ0χeE. (4.30) 186 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter The constant of proportionality, χe, is called the electric susceptibility of the medium (a factor of ϵ0 has been extracted to make χe dimensionless). The value of χe depends on the microscopic structure of the substance in question (and also on external conditions such as temperature). I shall call materials that obey Eq. 4.30 linear dielectrics. 7 Note that E in Eq. 4.30 is the total ﬁeld; it may be due in part to free charges and in part to the polarization itself. If, for instance, we put a piece of dielectric into an external ﬁeld E0, we cannot compute P directly from Eq. 4.30; the external ﬁeld will polarize the material, and this polarization will produce its own ﬁeld, which then contributes to the total ﬁeld, and this in turn modiﬁes the polarization, which ... Breaking out of this inﬁnite regress is not always easy. You’ll see some examples in a moment. The simplest approach is to begin with the displacement, at least in those cases where D can be deduced directly from the free charge distribution. In linear media we have D = ϵ0E + P = ϵ0E + ϵ0χeE = ϵ0(1 + χe)E, (4.31) so D is also proportional to E: D = ϵE, (4.32) where ϵ ≡ ϵ0(1 + χe). (4.33) This new constant ϵ is called the permittivity of the material. (In vacuum, where there is no matter to polarize, the susceptibility is zero, and the permittivity is ϵ0. That’s why ϵ0 is called the permittivity of free space. I dislike the term, for it suggests that the vacuum is just a special kind of linear dielectric, in which the permittivity happens to have the value 8.85 × 10 −12 C 2/N·m 2.) If you remove a factor of ϵ0, the remaining dimensionless quantity ϵr ≡ 1 + χe = ϵ ϵ0 (4.34) is called the relative permittivity,or dielectric constant, of the material. Dielec- tric constants for some common substances are listed in Table 4.2. (Notice that ϵr is greater than 1, for all ordinary materials.) Of course, the permittivity and the dielectric constant do not convey any information that was not already available in the susceptibility, nor is there anything essentially new in Eq. 4.32; the physics of linear dielectrics is all contained in Eq. 4.30.8 7In modern optical applications, especially, nonlinear materials have become increasingly important. For these there is a second term in the formula for P as a function of E—typically a cubic term. In gen- eral, Eq. 4.30 can be regarded as the ﬁrst (nonzero) term in the Taylor expansion of P in powers of E. 8As long as we are engaged in this orgy of unnecessary terminology and notation, I might as well mention that formulas for D in terms of E (Eq. 4.32, in the case of linear dielectrics) are called constitutive relations. 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 187 Dielectric Dielectric Material Constant Material Constant Vacuum 1 Benzene 2.28 Helium 1.000065 Diamond 5.7-5.9 Neon 1.00013 Salt 5.9 Hydrogen (H2) 1.000254 Silicon 11.7 Argon 1.000517 Methanol 33.0 Air (dry) 1.000536 Water 80.1 Nitrogen (N2) 1.000548 Ice (-30 ◦ C) 104 Water vapor (100◦ C) 1.00589 KTaNbO3 (0 ◦ C) 34,000 TABLE 4.2 Dielectric Constants (unless otherwise speciﬁed, values given are for 1 atm, 20 ◦ C).

It is surrounded, out to radius b, by linear dielectric material of permittivity ϵ.Find the potential at the center (relative to inﬁnity). Solution To compute V , we need to know E; to ﬁnd E, we might ﬁrst try to locate the bound charge; we could get the bound charge from P, but we can’t calculate P unless we already know E (Eq. 4.30). We seem to be in a bind. What we do know is the free charge Q, and fortunately the arrangement is spherically symmetric, so let’s begin by calculating D, using Eq. 4.23: D = Q 4πr 2 ˆr, for all points r > a. (Inside the metal sphere, of course, E = P = D = 0.) Once we know D,itisa trivial matter to obtain E, using Eq. 4.32: E = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ Q 4πϵr 2 ˆr, for a < r < b, Q 4πϵ0r 2 ˆr, for r > b. a b Q FIGURE 4.20 188 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter The potential at the center is therefore V =− ∫ 0 ∞ E · dl =− ∫ b ∞ ( Q 4πϵ0r 2 ) dr − ∫ a b ( Q 4πϵr 2 ) dr − ∫ 0 a (0) dr = Q 4π ( 1 ϵ0b + 1 ϵa − 1 ϵb ) . As it turns out, it was not necessary for us to compute the polarization or the bound charge explicitly, though this can easily be done: P = ϵ0χeE = ϵ0χe Q 4πϵr 2 ˆr, in the dielectric, and hence ρb =−∇ · P = 0, while σb = P · ˆn = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ ϵ0χe Q 4πϵb2 , at the outer surface, −ϵ0χe Q 4πϵa2 , at the inner surface. Notice that the surface bound charge at a is negative ( ˆn points outward with respect to the dielectric, which is +ˆr at b but −ˆr at a). This is natural, since the charge on the metal sphere attracts its opposite in all the dielectric molecules. It is this layer of negative charge that reduces the ﬁeld, within the dielectric, from 1/4πϵ0(Q/r 2)ˆr to 1/4πϵ(Q/r 2)ˆr. In this respect, a dielectric is rather like an imperfect conductor: on a conducting shell the induced surface charge would be such as to cancel the ﬁeld of Q completely in the region a < r < b; the dielectric does the best it can, but the cancellation is only partial. You might suppose that linear dielectrics escape the defect in the parallel between E and D. Since P and D are now proportional to E, does it not fol- low that their curls, like E’s, must vanish? Unfortunately, it does not, for the line integral of P around a closed path that straddles the boundary between one type of material and another need not be zero, even though the integral of E around the same loop must be. The reason is that the proportionality factor ϵ0χe is different on the two sides. For instance, at the interface between a polarized dielectric and the vacuum (Fig. 4.21), P is zero on one side but not on the other. Around this Vacuum Dielectric P = 0 P ≠ 0 FIGURE 4.21 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 189 loop ∮ P · dl ̸= 0, and hence, by Stokes’ theorem, the curl of P cannot vanish everywhere within the loop (in fact, it is inﬁnite at the boundary). 9 Of course, if the space is entirely ﬁlled with a homogeneous 10 linear dielectric, then this objection is void; in this rather special circumstance ∇ · D = ρ f and ∇ × D = 0, so D can be found from the free charge just as though the dielectric were not there: D = ϵ0Evac, where Evac is the ﬁeld the same free charge distribution would produce in the absence of any dielectric. According to Eqs. 4.32 and 4.34, therefore, E = 1 ϵ D = 1 ϵr Evac. (4.35) Conclusion: When all space is ﬁlled with a homogeneous linear dielectric, the ﬁeld everywhere is simply reduced by a factor of one over the dielectric constant. (Actually, it is not necessary for the dielectric to ﬁll all space: in regions where the ﬁeld is zero anyway, it can hardly matter whether the dielectric is present or not, since there’s no polarization in any event.) For example, if a free charge q is embedded in a large dielectric, the ﬁeld it produces is E = 1 4πϵ q r 2 ˆr (4.36) (that’s ϵ, not ϵ0), and the force it exerts on nearby charges is reduced accord- ingly. But it’s not that there is anything wrong with Coulomb’s law; rather, the polarization of the medium partially “shields” the charge, by surrounding it with bound charge of the opposite sign (Fig. 4.22).11 + + + + + + + + − − − −− − − − q FIGURE 4.22 9Putting that argument in differential form, Eq. 4.30 and product rule 7 yield ∇ × P =−ϵ0E × (∇χe), so the problem arises when ∇χe is not parallel to E. 10A homogeneous medium is one whose properties (in this case the susceptibility) do not vary with position. 11In quantum electrodynamics, the vacuum itself can be polarized, and this means that the effective (or “renormalized”) charge of the electron, as you might measure it in the laboratory, is not its true (“bare”) value, and in fact depends slightly on how far away you are! 190 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter Example 4.6. A parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.23) is ﬁlled with insulating material of dielectric constant ϵr . What effect does this have on its capacitance? Solution Since the ﬁeld is conﬁned to the space between the plates, the dielectric will reduce E, and hence also the potential difference V , by a factor 1/ϵr . Accordingly, the capacitance C = Q/V is increased by a factor of the dielectric constant, C = ϵr Cvac. (4.37) This is, in fact, a common way to beef up a capacitor. Dielectric FIGURE 4.23 A crystal is generally easier to polarize in some directions than in others,12 and in this case Eq. 4.30 is replaced by the general linear relation Px = ϵ0(χexx Ex + χexy E y + χexz Ez) Py = ϵ0(χeyx Ex + χeyy E y + χeyz Ez) Pz = ϵ0(χezx Ex + χezy E y + χezz Ez) ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ , (4.38) just as Eq. 4.1 was superseded by Eq. 4.3 for asymmetrical molecules. The nine coefﬁcients, χexx , χexy , ..., constitute the susceptibility tensor. Problem 4.18 The space between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.24) is ﬁlled with two slabs of linear dielectric material. Each slab has thickness a,so the total distance between the plates is 2a. Slab 1 has a dielectric constant of 2, and slab 2 has a dielectric constant of 1.5. The free charge density on the top plate is σ and on the bottom plate −σ . 12A medium is said to be isotropic if its properties (such as susceptibility) are the same in all directions. Thus Eq. 4.30 is the special case of Eq. 4.38 that holds for isotropic media. Physicists tend to be sloppy with their language, and unless otherwise indicated the term “linear dielectric” implies “isotropic linear dielectric,” and suggests “homogeneous isotropic linear dielectric.” But technically, “linear” just means that at any given point,and for E in a given direction, the components of P are proportional to E—the proportionality factor could vary with position and/or direction. 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 191 Slab Y a a −σ +σ Slab ^ FIGURE 4.24 (a) Find the electric displacement D in each slab.

(f) Now that you know all the charge (free and bound), recalculate the ﬁeld in each slab, and conﬁrm your answer to (b). Problem 4.19 Suppose you have enough linear dielectric material, of dielectric constant ϵr ,to half-ﬁll a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.25). By what fraction is the capacitance increased when you distribute the material as in Fig. 4.25(a)? How about Fig. 4.25(b)? For a given potential difference V between the plates, ﬁnd E, D,and P, in each region, and the free and bound charge on all surfaces, for both cases.

Find the potential at the center of the sphere (relative to inﬁnity), if its radius is R and the dielectric constant is ϵr .

Find the capacitance per unit length of this cable. a b c FIGURE 4.26 4.4.2 Boundary Value Problems with Linear Dielectrics In a (homogeneous isotropic) linear dielectric, the bound charge density (ρb)is proportional to the free charge density (ρ f ):13 ρb =−∇ · P =−∇ · (ϵ0 χe ϵ D ) =− ( χe 1 + χe ) ρ f . (4.39) In particular, unless free charge is actually embedded in the material, ρ = 0, and any net charge must reside at the surface. Within such a dielectric, then, the potential obeys Laplace’s equation, and all the machinery of Chapter 3 carries over. It is convenient, however, to rewrite the boundary conditions in a way that makes reference only to the free charge. Equation 4.26 says ϵabove E ⊥ above − ϵbelow E ⊥ below = σ f , (4.40) or (in terms of the potential), ϵabove ∂ Vabove ∂n − ϵbelow ∂ Vbelow ∂n =−σ f , (4.41) whereas the potential itself is, of course, continuous (Eq. 2.34): Vabove = Vbelow. (4.42) 13This does not apply to the surface charge (σb), because χe is not independent of position (obviously) at the boundary. 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 193 Example 4.7. A sphere of homogeneous linear dielectric material is placed in an otherwise uniform electric ﬁeld E0 (Fig. 4.27). Find the electric ﬁeld inside the sphere. E0 E FIGURE 4.27 Solution This is reminiscent of Ex. 3.8, in which an uncharged conducting sphere was introduced into a uniform ﬁeld. In that case, the ﬁeld of the induced charge canceled E0 within the sphere; in a dielectric, the cancellation (from the bound charge) is incomplete. Our problem is to solve Laplace’s equation, for Vin(r,θ ) when r ≤ R, and Vout(r,θ ) when r ≥ R, subject to the boundary conditions (i) Vin = Vout, at r = R, (ii)ϵ ∂ Vin ∂r = ϵ0 ∂ Vout ∂r , at r = R, (iii) Vout →−E0r cos θ, for r ≫ R. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (4.43) (The second of these follows from Eq. 4.41, since there is no free charge at the surface.) Inside the sphere, Eq. 3.65 says Vin(r,θ ) = ∞∑ l=0 Al r l Pl(cos θ); (4.44) outside the sphere, in view of (iii), we have Vout(r,θ ) =−E0r cos θ + ∞∑ l=0 Bl r l+1 Pl(cos θ). (4.45) Boundary condition (i) requires that ∞∑ l=0 Al Rl Pl(cos θ) =−E0 R cos θ + ∞∑ l=0 Bl Rl+1 Pl(cos θ), 194 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter so 14 Al Rl = Bl Rl+1 , for l ̸= 1, A1 R =−E0 R + B1 R2 . ⎫ ⎪⎬ ⎪⎭ (4.46) Meanwhile, condition (ii) yields ϵr ∞∑ l=0 lAl Rl−1 Pl(cos θ) =−E0 cos θ − ∞∑ l=0 (l + 1)Bl Rl+2 Pl(cos θ), so ϵrlAl Rl−1 =− (l + 1)Bl Rl+2 , for l ̸= 1, ϵr A1 =−E0 − 2B1 R3 . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (4.47) It follows that Al = Bl = 0, for l ̸= 1, A1 =− 3 ϵr + 2 E0 B1 = ϵr − 1 ϵr + 2 R3 E0. ⎫ ⎪⎬ ⎪⎭ (4.48) Evidently Vin(r,θ ) =− 3E0 ϵr + 2 r cos θ =− 3E0 ϵr + 2 z, and hence the ﬁeld inside the sphere is (surprisingly) uniform: E = 3 ϵr + 2 E0. (4.49) Example 4.8. Suppose the entire region below the plane z = 0 in Fig. 4.28 is ﬁlled with uniform linear dielectric material of susceptibility χe. Calculate the force on a point charge q situated a distance d above the origin. 14Remember, P1(cos θ) = cos θ , and the coefﬁcients must be equal for each l, as you could prove by multiplying by Pl′ (cos θ) sin θ , integrating from 0 to π , and invoking the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials (Eq. 3.68). 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 195 x y z d q θ r FIGURE 4.28 Solution The surface bound charge on the xy plane is of opposite sign to q,sothe force will be attractive. (In view of Eq. 4.39, there is no volume bound charge.) Let us ﬁrst calculate σb, using Eqs. 4.11 and 4.30.15 σb = P · ˆn = Pz = ϵ0χe Ez, where Ez is the z-component of the total ﬁeld just inside the dielectric, at z = 0. This ﬁeld is due in part to q and in part to the bound charge itself. From Coulomb’s law, the former contribution is − 1 4πϵ0 q (r 2 + d 2) cos θ =− 1 4πϵ0 qd (r 2 + d 2)3/2 , where r = √x 2 + y2 is the distance from the origin. The z component of the ﬁeld of the bound charge, meanwhile, is −σb/2ϵ0 (see footnote after Eq. 2.33). Thus σb = ϵ0χe [− 1 4πϵ0 qd (r 2 + d 2)3/2 − σb 2ϵ0 ] , which we can solve for σb: σb =− 1 2π ( χe χe + 2 ) qd (r 2 + d 2)3/2 . (4.50) Apart from the factor χe/(χe + 2), this is exactly the same as the induced charge on an inﬁnite conducting plane under similar circumstances (Eq. 3.10).16 Evi- dently the total bound charge is qb =− ( χe χe + 2 ) q. (4.51) 15This method mimics Prob. 3.38. 16For some purposes a conductor can be regarded as the limiting case of a linear dielectric, with χe →∞. This is often a useful check—try applying it to Exs. 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7. 196 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter We could, of course, obtain the ﬁeld of σb by direct integration E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ( ˆr r2 ) σb da. But, as in the case of the conducting plane, there is a nicer solution by the method of images. Indeed, if we replace the dielectric by a single point charge qb at the image position (0, 0, −d),wehave V = 1 4πϵ0 [ q √x 2 + y2 + (z − d)2 + qb √x 2 + y2 + (z + d)2 ] , (4.52) in the region z > 0. Meanwhile, a charge (q + qb) at (0, 0, d) yields the potential V = 1 4πϵ0 [ q + qb √x 2 + y2 + (z − d)2 ] , (4.53) for the region z < 0. Taken together, Eqs. 4.52 and 4.53 constitute a function that satisﬁes Poisson’s equation with a point charge q at (0, 0, d), which goes to zero at inﬁnity, which is continuous at the boundary z = 0, and whose normal derivative exhibits the discontinuity appropriate to a surface charge σb at z = 0: −ϵ0 ( ∂ V ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣z=0+ − ∂ V ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣z=0− ) =− 1 2π ( χe χe + 2 ) qd (x 2 + y2 + d 2)3/2 . Accordingly, this is the correct potential for our problem. In particular, the force on q is: F = 1 4πϵ0 qqb (2d)2 ˆz =− 1 4πϵ0 ( χe χe + 2 ) q 2 4d 2 ˆz. (4.54) I do not claim to have provided a compelling motivation for Eqs. 4.52 and 4.53—like all image solutions, this one owes its justiﬁcation to the fact that it works: it solves Poisson’s equation, and it meets the boundary conditions. Still, discovering an image solution is not entirely a matter of guesswork. There are at least two “rules of the game”: (1) You must never put an image charge into the region where you’re computing the potential. (Thus Eq. 4.52 gives the potential for z > 0, but this image charge qb is at z =−d; when we turn to the region z < 0 (Eq. 4.53), the image charge (q + qb) is at z =+d.) (2) The image charges must add up to the correct total in each region. (That’s how I knew to use qb to account for the charge in the region z ≤ 0, and (q + qb) to cover the region z ≥ 0.) Problem 4.22 A very long cylinder of linear dielectric material is placed in an otherwise uniform electric ﬁeld E0. Find the resulting ﬁeld within the cylinder. (The radius is a, the susceptibility χe, and the axis is perpendicular to E0.) 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 197 Problem 4.23 Find the ﬁeld inside a sphere of linear dielectric material in an oth- erwise uniform electric ﬁeld E0 (Ex. 4.7) by the following method of successive approximations: First pretend the ﬁeld inside is just E0, and use Eq. 4.30 to write down the resulting polarization P0. This polarization generates a ﬁeld of its own, E1 (Ex. 4.2), which in turn modiﬁes the polarization by an amount P1,which fur- ther changes the ﬁeld by an amount E2, and so on. The resulting ﬁeld is E0 + E1+ E2 + ··· . Sum the series, and compare your answer with Eq. 4.49. Problem 4.24 An uncharged conducting sphere of radius a is coated with a thick insulating shell (dielectric constant ϵr ) out to radius b. This object is now placed in an otherwise uniform electric ﬁeld E0. Find the electric ﬁeld in the insulator. Problem 4.25 Suppose the region above the xy plane in Ex. 4.8 is also ﬁlled with! linear dielectric but of a different susceptibility χ ′ e. Find the potential everywhere. 4.4.3 Energy in Dielectric Systems It takes work to charge up a capacitor (Eq. 2.55): W = 1 2 CV 2. If the capacitor is ﬁlled with linear dielectric, its capacitance exceeds the vacuum value by a factor of the dielectric constant, C = ϵr Cvac, as we found in Ex. 4.6. Evidently the work necessary to charge a dielectric-ﬁlled capacitor is increased by the same factor. The reason is pretty clear: you have to pump on more (free) charge, to achieve a given potential, because part of the ﬁeld is canceled off by the bound charges. In Chapter 2, I derived a general formula for the energy stored in any electro- static system (Eq. 2.45): W = ϵ0 2 ∫ E 2 dτ. (4.55) The case of the dielectric-ﬁlled capacitor suggests that this should be changed to W = ϵ0 2 ∫ ϵr E 2 dτ = 1 2 ∫ D · E dτ, in the presence of linear dielectrics. To prove it, suppose the dielectric material is ﬁxed in position, and we bring in the free charge, a bit at a time. As ρ f is increased by an amount <ρ f , the polarization will change and with it the bound charge distribution; but we’re interested only in the work done on the incremental free charge: <W = ∫ (<ρ f )Vdτ. (4.56) 198 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter Since ∇ · D = ρ f , <ρ f = ∇ · (<D), where <D is the resulting change in D,so <W = ∫ [∇ · (<D)]Vdτ. Now ∇ ·[(<D)V ]=[∇ · (<D)]V + <D · (∇V ), and hence (integrating by parts): <W = ∫ ∇ ·[(<D)V ] dτ + ∫ (<D) · E dτ. The divergence theorem turns the ﬁrst term into a surface integral, which vanishes if we integrate over all space. Therefore, the work done is equal to <W = ∫ (<D) · E dτ. (4.57) So far, this applies to any material. Now, if the medium is a linear dielectric, then D = ϵE,so 1 2 <(D · E) = 1 2 <(ϵ E 2) = ϵ(<E) · E = (<D) · E (for inﬁnitesimal increments). Thus <W = < ( 1 2 ∫ D · E dτ ) . The total work done, then, as we build the free charge up from zero to the ﬁnal conﬁguration, is W = 1 2 ∫ D · E dτ, (4.58) as anticipated.17 It may puzzle you that Eq. 4.55, which we derived quite generally in Chap- ter 2, does not seem to apply in the presence of dielectrics, where it is replaced by Eq. 4.58. The point is not that one or the other of these equations is wrong, but rather that they address somewhat different questions. The distinction is sub- tle, so let’s go right back to the beginning: What do we mean by “the energy of a system”? Answer: It is the work required to assemble the system. Very 17In case you are wondering why I did not do this more simply by the method of Sect. 2.4.3, starting with W = 1 2 ∫ ρ f Vdτ , the reason is that this formula is untrue, in general. Study the derivation of Eq. 2.42, and you will see that it applies only to the total charge. For linear dielectrics it happens to hold for the free charge alone, but this is scarcely obvious a priori and, in fact, is most easily conﬁrmed by working backward from Eq. 4.58. 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 199 well—but when dielectrics are involved, there are two quite different ways one might construe this process: 1. We bring in all the charges (free and bound), one by one, with tweezers, and glue each one down in its proper ﬁnal location. If this is what you mean by “assemble the system,” then Eq. 4.55 is your formula for the energy stored. Notice, however, that this will not include the work involved in stretching and twisting the dielectric molecules (if we picture the positive and nega- tive charges as held together by tiny springs, it does not include the spring energy, 1 2 kx 2, associated with polarizing each molecule). 18 2. With the unpolarized dielectric in place, we bring in the free charges, one by one, allowing the dielectric to respond as it sees ﬁt. If this is what you mean by “assemble the system” (and ordinarily it is, since free charge is what we actually push around), then Eq. 4.58 is the formula you want. In this case the “spring” energy is included, albeit indirectly, because the force you must apply to the free charge depends on the disposition of the bound charge; as you move the free charge, you are automatically stretching those “springs.” Example 4.9. A sphere of radius R is ﬁlled with material of dielectric constant ϵr and uniform embedded free charge ρ f . What is the energy of this conﬁguration? Solution From Gauss’s law (in the form of Eq. 4.23), the displacement is D(r ) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ ρ f 3 r (r < R), ρ f 3 R3 r 2 ˆr (r > R). So the electric ﬁeld is E(r ) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ ρ f 3ϵ0ϵr r (r < R), ρ f 3ϵ0 R3 r 2 ˆr (r > R). The purely electrostatic energy (Eq. 4.55) is W1 = ϵ0 2 [( ρ f 3ϵ0ϵr )2 ∫ R 0 r 2 4πr 2 dr + ( ρ f 3ϵ0 )2 R6 ∫ ∞ R 1 r 4 4πr 2 dr ] = 2π 9ϵ0 ρ2 f R5 ( 1 5ϵ2 r + 1 ) . 18The “spring” itself may be electrical in nature, but it is still not included in Eq. 4.55, if E is taken to be the macroscopic ﬁeld. 200 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter But the total energy (Eq. 4.58) is W2 = 1 2 [( ρ f 3 ) ( ρ f 3ϵ0ϵr ) ∫ R 0 r 2 4πr 2 dr + ( ρ f R3 3 )( ρ f R3 3ϵ0 ) ∫ ∞ R 1 r 4 4πr 2 dr ] = 2π 9ϵ0 ρ2 f R5 ( 1 5ϵr + 1 ) . Notice that W1 < W2—that’s because W1 does not include the energy involved in stretching the molecules. Let’s check that W2 is the work done on the free charge in assembling the system. We start with the (uncharged, unpolarized) dielectric sphere, and bring in the free charge in inﬁnitesimal installments (dq), ﬁlling out the sphere layer by layer. When we have reached radius r ′, the electric ﬁeld is E(r ) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ρ f 3ϵ0ϵr r (r < r ′), ρ f 3ϵ0ϵr r ′3 r 2 ˆr (r ′ < r < R), ρ f 3ϵ0 r ′3 r 2 ˆr (r > R). The work required to bring the next dq in from inﬁnity to r ′ is dW =−dq [∫ R ∞ E · dl + ∫ r ′ R E · dl ] =−dq [ ρ f r ′3 3ϵ0 ∫ R ∞ 1 r 2 dr + ρ f r ′3 3ϵ0ϵr ∫ r ′ R 1 r 2 dr ] = ρ f r ′3 3ϵ0 [ 1 R + 1 ϵr ( 1 r ′ − 1 R )] dq. This increases the radius (r ′): dq = ρ f 4πr ′2 dr ′, so the total work done, in going from r ′ = 0to r ′ = R,is W = 4πρ2 f 3ϵ0 [ 1 R (1 − 1 ϵr ) ∫ R 0 r ′5 dr ′ + 1 ϵr ∫ R 0 r ′4 dr ′] = 2π 9ϵ0 ρ2 f R5 ( 1 5ϵr + 1 ) = W2. □ Evidently the energy “stored in the springs” is Wspring = W2 − W1 = 2π 45ϵ0ϵ2 r ρ2 f R5 (ϵr − 1) . 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 201 I would like to conﬁrm this in an explicit model. Picture the dielectric as a col- lection of tiny proto-dipoles, each consisting of +q and −q attached to a spring of constant k and equilibrium length 0, so in the absence of any ﬁeld the positive and negative ends coincide. One end of each dipole is nailed in position (like the nuclei in a solid), but the other end is free to move in response to any imposed ﬁeld. Let dτ be the volume assigned to each proto-dipole (the dipole itself may occupy only a small portion of this space). With the ﬁeld turned on, the electric force on the free end is balanced by the spring force;19 the charges separate by a distance d: qE = kd. In our case E = ρ f 3ϵ0ϵr r. The resulting dipole moment is p = qd, and the polarization is P = p/dτ ,so k = ρ f 3ϵ0ϵr d 2 Pr dτ. The energy of this particular spring is dWspring = 1 2 kd 2 = ρ f 6ϵ0ϵr Pr dτ, and hence the total is Wspring = ρ f 6ϵ0ϵr ∫ Pr dτ. Now P = ϵ0χeE = ϵ0χe ρ f 3ϵ0ϵr r = (ϵr − 1)ρ f 3ϵr r, so Wspring = ρ f 6ϵ0ϵr (ϵr − 1)ρ f 3ϵr 4π ∫ R 0 r 4 dr = 2π 45ϵ0ϵ2 r ρ2 f R5 (ϵr − 1) , and it works out perfectly. It is sometimes alleged that Eq. 4.58 represents the energy even for nonlinear dielectrics, but this is false: To proceed beyond Eq. 4.57, one must assume lin- earity. In fact, for dissipative systems the whole notion of “stored energy” loses its meaning, because the work done depends not only on the ﬁnal conﬁguration but on how it got there. If the molecular “springs” are allowed to have some 19Note that the “spring” here is a surrogate for whatever holds the molecule together—it includes the electrical attraction of the other end. If it bothers you that the force is taken to be proportional to the separation, look again at Example 4.1. 202 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter friction, for instance, then Wspring can be made as large as you like, by assem- bling the charges in such a way that the spring is obliged to expand and con- tract many times before reaching its ﬁnal state. In particular, you get nonsensical results if you try to apply Eq. 4.58 to electrets, with frozen-in polarization (see Prob. 4.27). Problem 4.26 A spherical conductor, of radius a, carries a charge Q (Fig. 4.29). It is surrounded by linear dielectric material of susceptibility χe, out to radius b. Find the energy of this conﬁguration (Eq. 4.58). Q a b FIGURE 4.29 Problem 4.27 Calculate W , using both Eq. 4.55 and Eq. 4.58, for a sphere of radius R with frozen-in uniform polarization P (Ex. 4.2). Comment on the discrepancy. Which (if either) is the “true” energy of the system? 4.4.4 Forces on Dielectrics Just as a conductor is attracted into an electric ﬁeld (Eq. 2.51), so too is a dielectric—and for essentially the same reason: the bound charge tends to accu- mulate near the free charge of the opposite sign. But the calculation of forces on dielectrics can be surprisingly tricky. Consider, for example, the case of a slab of linear dielectric material, partially inserted between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.30). We have always pretended that the ﬁeld is uniform inside a parallel-plate capacitor, and zero outside. If this were literally true, there would be no net force on the dielectric at all, since the ﬁeld everywhere would be per- pendicular to the plates. However, there is in reality a fringing ﬁeld around the edges, which for most purposes can be ignored but in this case is responsible for the whole effect. (Indeed, the ﬁeld could not terminate abruptly at the edge of the capacitor, for if it did, the line integral of E around the closed loop shown in Fig. 4.31 would not be zero.) It is this nonuniform fringing ﬁeld that pulls the dielectric into the capacitor. Fringing ﬁelds are notoriously difﬁcult to calculate; luckily, we can avoid this altogether, by the following ingenious method.20 Let W be the energy of the 20For a direct calculation from the fringing ﬁelds, see E. R. Dietz, Am. J. Phys. 72, 1499 (2004). 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 203 Dielectric l w d x FIGURE 4.30 x y E d l = 0 Fringing region . FIGURE 4.31 system—it depends, of course, on the amount of overlap. If I pull the dielectric out an inﬁnitesimal distance dx, the energy is changed by an amount equal to the work done: dW = Fme dx, (4.59) where Fme is the force I must exert, to counteract the electrical force F on the dielectric: Fme =−F. Thus the electrical force on the slab is F =− dW dx . (4.60) Now, the energy stored in the capacitor is W = 1 2 CV 2, (4.61) and the capacitance in this case is C = ϵ0w d (ϵrl − χex), (4.62) where l is the length of the plates (Fig. 4.30). Let’s assume that the total charge on the plates (Q = CV ) is held constant, as the dielectric moves. In terms of Q, W = 1 2 Q2 C , (4.63) 204 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter so F =− dW dx = 1 2 Q2 C 2 dC dx = 1 2 V 2 dC dx . (4.64) But dC dx =− ϵ0χew d , and hence F =− ϵ0χew 2d V 2. (4.65) (The minus sign indicates that the force is in the negative x direction; the dielectric is pulled into the capacitor.) It is a common error to use Eq. 4.61 (with V constant), rather than Eq. 4.63 (with Q constant), in computing the force. One then obtains F =− 1 2 V 2 dC dx , which is off by a sign. It is, of course, possible to maintain the capacitor at a ﬁxed potential, by connecting it up to a battery. But in that case the battery also does work as the dielectric moves; instead of Eq. 4.59, we now have dW = Fme dx + Vd Q, (4.66) where Vd Q is the work done by the battery. It follows that F =− dW dx + V dQ dx =− 1 2 V 2 dC dx + V 2 dC dx = 1 2 V 2 dC dx , (4.67) the same as before (Eq. 4.64), with the correct sign. Please understand: The force on the dielectric cannot possibly depend on whether you plan to hold Q constant or V constant—it is determined entirely by the distribution of charge, free and bound. It’s simpler to calculate the force assuming constant Q, because then you don’t have to worry about work done by the battery; but if you insist, it can be done correctly either way. Notice that we were able to determine the force without knowing anything about the fringing ﬁelds that are ultimately responsible for it! Of course, it’s built into the whole structure of electrostatics that ∇ × E = 0, and hence that the fring- ing ﬁelds must be present; we’re not really getting something for nothing here— just cleverly exploiting the internal consistency of the theory. The energy stored in the fringing ﬁelds themselves (which was not accounted for in this derivation) stays constant, as the slab moves; what does change is the energy well inside the capacitor, where the ﬁeld is nice and uniform. Problem 4.28 Two long coaxial cylindrical metal tubes (inner radius a, outer radius b) stand vertically in a tank of dielectric oil (susceptibility χe, mass density ρ). The inner one is maintained at potential V , and the outer one is grounded (Fig. 4.32). To what height (h) does the oil rise, in the space between the tubes? 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 205 Oil h a b FIGURE 4.32 More Problems on Chapter 4 Problem 4.29 (a) For the conﬁguration in Prob. 4.5, calculate the force on p2 due to p1, and the force on p1 due to p2.

(b) Find the total torque on p2 with respect to the center of p1, and compare it with the torque on p1 about that same point.[Hint: combine your answer to (a) with the result of Prob. 4.5.] Problem 4.30 An electric dipole p, pointing in the y direction, is placed midway between two large conducting plates, as shown in Fig. 4.33. Each plate makes a +V x y −V p θ θ FIGURE 4.33 206 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter small angle θ with respect to the x axis, and they are maintained at potentials ±V . What is the direction of the net force on p? (There’s nothing to calculate, here, but do explain your answer qualitatively.) Problem 4.31 A point charge Q is “nailed down” on a table. Around it, at radius R, is a frictionless circular track on which a dipole p rides, constrained always to point tangent to the circle. Use Eq. 4.5 to show that the electric force on the dipole is F = Q 4πϵ0 p R3 . Notice that this force is always in the “forward” direction (you can easily conﬁrm this by drawing a diagram showing the forces on the two ends of the dipole). Why isn’t this a perpetual motion machine? 21 Problem 4.32 Earnshaw’s theorem (Prob. 3.2) says that you cannot trap a charged! particle in an electrostatic ﬁeld. Question: Could you trap a neutral (but polarizable) atom in an electrostatic ﬁeld? (a) Show that the force on the atom is F = 1 2 α∇(E 2). (b) The question becomes, therefore: Is it possible for E 2 to have a local maximum (in a charge-free region)? In that case the force would push the atom back to its equilibrium position. Show that the answer is no.[Hint: Use Prob. 3.4(a).]22 Problem 4.33 A dielectric cube of side a, centered at the origin, carries a “frozen- in” polarization P = kr,where k is a constant. Find all the bound charges, and check that they add up to zero. Problem 4.34 The space between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor is ﬁlled with dielectric material whose dielectric constant varies linearly from 1 at the bottom plate (x = 0) to 2 at the top plate (x = d). The capacitor is connected to a battery of voltage V . Find all the bound charge, and check that the total is zero. Problem 4.35 A point charge q is imbedded at the center of a sphere of linear dielectric material (with susceptibility χe and radius R). Find the electric ﬁeld, the polarization, and the bound charge densities, ρb and σb. What is the total bound charge on the surface? Where is the compensating negative bound charge located? Problem 4.36 At the interface between one linear dielectric and another, the electric ﬁeld lines bend (see Fig. 4.34). Show that tan θ2/ tan θ1 = ϵ2/ϵ1, (4.68) assuming there is no free charge at the boundary. [Comment: Eq. 4.68 is reminiscent of Snell’s law in optics. Would a convex “lens” of dielectric material tend to “focus,” or “defocus,” the electric ﬁeld?] 21This charming paradox was suggested by K. Brownstein. 22Interestingly, it can be done with oscillating ﬁelds. See K. T. McDonald, Am. J. Phys. 68, 486 (2000). 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 207 θ2 θ1 E2 E1 \u00021 \u00022 FIGURE 4.34 Problem 4.37 A point dipole p is imbedded at the center of a sphere of linear! dielectric material (with radius R and dielectric constant ϵr ).

Claim: the potential everywhere is exactly the same as it would have been in the absence of the dielectric! Check this claim, as follows: (a) Write down the formula for the proposed potential V (r ), in terms of V0, R, and r . Use it to determine the ﬁeld, the polarization, the bound charge, and the free charge distribution on the sphere.

(4.69) [Here Eext is the ﬁeld of everything except the dielectric. You might assume that it wouldn’t matter if you used the total ﬁeld; after all, the dielectric can’t exert a force on itself. However, because the ﬁeld of the dielectric is discontinuous at the location of any bound surface charge, the derivative introduces a spurious delta function, and it is safest to stick with Eext.] Use Eq. 4.69 to determine the force on a tiny sphere, of radius R, composed of linear dielectric material of susceptibility χe,which is situated a distance s from a ﬁne wire carrying a uniform line charge λ. Problem 4.41 In a linear dielectric, the polarization is proportional to the ﬁeld:! P = ϵ0χeE. If the material consists of atoms (or nonpolar molecules), the induced dipole moment of each one is likewise proportional to the ﬁeld p = αE. Question: What is the relation between the atomic polarizability α and the susceptibility χe? Since P (the dipole moment per unit volume) is p (the dipole moment per atom) times N (the number of atoms per unit volume), P = N p = N αE, one’s ﬁrst incli- nation is to say that χe = N α ϵ0 . (4.70) And in fact this is not far off, if the density is low. But closer inspection reveals a subtle problem, for the ﬁeld E in Eq. 4.30 is the total macroscopic ﬁeld in the medium, whereas the ﬁeld in Eq. 4.1 is due to everything except the particular atom under consideration (polarizability was deﬁned for an isolated atom subject to a speciﬁed external ﬁeld); call this ﬁeld Eelse. Imagine that the space allotted to each atom is a sphere of radius R,and show that E = ( 1 − N α 3ϵ0 ) Eelse. (4.71) Use this to conclude that χe = N α/ϵ0 1 − N α/3ϵ0 , or α = 3ϵ0 N ( ϵr − 1 ϵr + 2 ) . (4.72) 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 209 Equation 4.72 is known as the Clausius-Mossotti formula, or, in its application to optics, the Lorentz-Lorenz equation. Problem 4.42 Check the Clausius-Mossotti relation (Eq. 4.72) for the gases listed in Table 4.1. (Dielectric constants are given in Table 4.2.) (The densities here are so small that Eqs. 4.70 and 4.72 are indistinguishable. For experimental data that conﬁrm the Clausius-Mossotti correction term see, for instance, the ﬁrst edition of Purcell’s Electricity and Magnetism, Problem 9.28.)23 Problem 4.43 The Clausius-Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.41) tells you how to cal-! culate the susceptibility of a nonpolar substance, in terms of the atomic polariz- ability α.The Langevin equation tells you how to calculate the susceptibility of a polar substance, in terms of the permanent molecular dipole moment p.Here’show it goes: (a) The energy of a dipole in an external ﬁeld E is u =−p · E =− pE cos θ (Eq. 4.6), where θ is the usual polar angle, if we orient the z axis along E. Statistical mechanics says that for a material in equilibrium at absolute temper- ature T , the probability of a given molecule having energy u is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, exp(−u/kT ). The average energy of the dipoles is therefore <u> = ∫ ue−(u/kT ) d\r ∫ e−(u/kT ) d\r , where d\r = sin θ dθ dφ, and the integration is over all orientations (θ : 0 → π ; φ : 0 → 2π ). Use this to show that the polarization of a substance containing N molecules per unit volume is P = Np[coth( pE/kT ) − (kT / pE)]. (4.73) That’s the Langevin formula. Sketch P/Np as a function of pE/kT . (b) Notice that for large ﬁelds/low temperatures, virtually all the molecules are lined up, and the material is nonlinear. Ordinarily, however, kT is much greater than pE. Show that in this régime the material is linear, and calculate its suscep- tibility, in terms of N , p, T ,and k. Compute the susceptibility of water at 20 ◦C, and compare the experimental value in Table 4.2. (The dipole moment of water is 6.1 × 10 −30 C·m.) This is rather far off, because we have again neglected the distinction between E and Eelse. The agreement is better in low-density gases, for which the difference between E and Eelse is negligible. Try it for water vapor at 100 ◦C and 1 atm. 23E. M. Purcell, Electricity and Magnetism (Berkeley Physics Course, Vol. 2), (New York: McGraw- Hill, 1963). CHAPTER 5 Magnetostatics 5.1 THE LORENTZ FORCE LAW 5.1.1 Magnetic Fields Remember the basic problem of classical electrodynamics: We have a collection of charges q1, q2, q3, ... (the “source” charges), and we want to calculate the force they exert on some other charge Q (the “test” charge). (See Fig. 5.1.) According to the principle of superposition, it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd the force of a single source charge—the total is then the vector sum of all the individual forces. Up to now, we have conﬁned our attention to the simplest case, electrostatics, in which the source charge is at rest (though the test charge need not be). The time has come to consider the forces between charges in motion. To give you some sense of what is in store, imagine that I set up the following demonstration: Two wires hang from the ceiling, a few centimeters apart; when I turn on a current, so that it passes up one wire and back down the other, the wires jump apart—they evidently repel one another (Fig. 5.2(a)). How do we explain this? You might suppose that the battery (or whatever drives the current) is actually charging up the wire, and that the force is simply due to the electrical repulsion of like charges. But this is incorrect. I could hold up a test charge near these wires, and there would be no force on it,1 for the wires are in fact electrically neutral. (It’s true that electrons are ﬂowing down the line—that’s what a current is—but there are just as many stationary plus charges as moving minus charges on any given segment.) Moreover, if I hook up my demonstration so as to make the current ﬂow up both wires (Fig. 5.2(b)), they are found to attract! q1 q2 q3 Source charges Test charge Q FIGURE 5.1 1This is not precisely true, as we shall see in Prob. 7.43. 210 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 211 Battery Battery (a) Currents in opposite directions repel. (b) Currents in same directions attract. +− +− FIGURE 5.2 Whatever force accounts for the attraction of parallel currents and the repulsion of antiparallel ones is not electrostatic in nature. It is our ﬁrst encounter with a magnetic force. Whereas a stationary charge produces only an electric ﬁeld E in the space around it, a moving charge generates, in addition, a magnetic ﬁeld B. In fact, magnetic ﬁelds are a lot easier to detect, in practice—all you need is a Boy Scout compass. How these devices work is irrelevant at the moment; it is enough to know that the needle points in the direction of the local magnetic ﬁeld. Ordinarily, this means north, in response to the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, but in the laboratory, where typical ﬁelds may be hundreds of times stronger than that, the compass indicates the direction of whatever magnetic ﬁeld is present. Current Magnetic field FIGURE 5.3 F Wire 1 Wire 2 B v II FIGURE 5.4 212 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics Now, if you hold up a tiny compass in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire, you quickly discover a very peculiar thing: The ﬁeld does not point toward the wire, nor away from it, but rather it circles around the wire. In fact, if you grab the wire with your right hand—thumb in the direction of the current—your ﬁngers curl around in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 5.3). How can such a ﬁeld lead to a force of attraction on a nearby parallel current? At the second wire, the magnetic ﬁeld points into the page (Fig. 5.4), the current is upward, and yet the resulting force is to the left! It’s going to take a strange law to account for these directions. 5.1.2 Magnetic Forces In fact, this combination of directions is just right for a cross product: the magnetic force on a charge Q, moving with velocity v in a magnetic ﬁeld B,is2 Fmag = Q(v × B). (5.1) This is known as the Lorentz force law. 3 In the presence of both electric and magnetic ﬁelds, the net force on Q would be F = Q[E + (v × B)]. (5.2) I do not pretend to have derived Eq. 5.1, of course; it is a fundamental axiom of the theory, whose justiﬁcation is to be found in experiments such as the one I described in Sect. 5.1.1. Our main job from now on is to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld B (and for that matter the electric ﬁeld E as well; the rules are more complicated when the source charges are in motion). But before we proceed, it is worthwhile to take a closer look at the Lorentz force law itself; it is a peculiar law, and it leads to some truly bizarre particle trajectories. Example 5.1. Cyclotron motion. The archtypical motion of a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld is circular, with the magnetic force providing the centripetal acceleration. In Fig. 5.5, a uniform magnetic ﬁeld points into the page; if the charge Q moves counterclockwise, with speed v, around a circle of radius R, the magnetic force points inward, and has a ﬁxed magnitude Qv B—just right to sustain uniform circular motion: Qv B = m v2 R , or p = QB R, (5.3) 2Since F and v are vectors, B is actually a pseudovector. 3Actually, it is due to Oliver Heaviside. 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 213 y Q R x z v B F FIGURE 5.5 B v\u0002 FIGURE 5.6 where m is the particle’s mass and p = mv is its momentum. Equation 5.3 is known as the cyclotron formula because it describes the motion of a particle in a cyclotron—the ﬁrst of the modern particle accelerators. It also suggests a simple experimental technique for ﬁnding the momentum of a charged particle: send it through a region of known magnetic ﬁeld, and measure the radius of its trajectory. This is in fact the standard means for determining the momenta of elementary particles. I assumed that the charge moves in a plane perpendicular to B. If it starts out with some additional speed v⃝ parallel to B, this component of the motion is unaffected by the magnetic ﬁeld, and the particle moves in a helix (Fig. 5.6). The radius is still given by Eq. 5.3, but the velocity in question is now the component perpendicular to B, v⊥. Example 5.2. Cycloid Motion. A more exotic trajectory occurs if we include a uniform electric ﬁeld, at right angles to the magnetic one. Suppose, for instance, that B points in the x-direction, and E in the z-direction, as shown in Fig. 5.7. A positive charge is released from the origin; what path will it follow? Solution Let’s think it through qualitatively, ﬁrst. Initially, the particle is at rest, so the mag- netic force is zero, and the electric ﬁeld accelerates the charge in the z-direction. As it picks up speed, a magnetic force develops which, according to Eq. 5.1, pulls the charge around to the right. The faster it goes, the stronger Fmag becomes; eventually, it curves the particle back around towards the y axis. At this point the charge is moving against the electrical force, so it begins to slow down—the mag- netic force then decreases, and the electrical force takes over, bringing the particle to rest at point a, in Fig. 5.7. There the entire process commences anew, carrying the particle over to point b, and so on. Now let’s do it quantitatively. There being no force in the x-direction, the posi- tion of the particle at any time t can be described by the vector (0, y(t), z(t)); the velocity is therefore 214 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics z ab c y x E B 0 FIGURE 5.7 v = (0, ˙y, ˙z), where dots indicate time derivatives. Thus v × B = √ √ √ √ √ √ ˆx ˆy ˆz 0 ˙y ˙z B 00 √ √ √ √ √ √ = B ˙z ˆy − B ˙y ˆz, and hence, applying Newton’s second law, F = Q(E + v × B) = Q(E ˆz + B ˙z ˆy − B ˙y ˆz) = ma = m( ¨y ˆy +¨z ˆz). Or, treating the ˆy and ˆz components separately, QB ˙z = m ¨y, QE − QB ˙y = m ¨z. For convenience, let ω ≡ QB m . (5.4) (This is the cyclotron frequency, at which the particle would revolve in the ab- sence of any electric ﬁeld.) Then the equations of motion take the form ¨y = ω˙z, ¨z = ω ( E B −˙y) . (5.5) Their general solution4 is y(t) = C1 cos ωt + C2 sin ωt + (E/B)t + C3, z(t) = C2 cos ωt − C1 sin ωt + C4. } (5.6) 4As coupled differential equations, they are easily solved by differentiating the ﬁrst and using the second to eliminate ¨z. 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 215 But the particle started from rest ( ˙y(0) = ˙z(0) = 0), at the origin (y(0) = z(0) = 0); these four conditions determine the constants C1, C2, C3, and C4: y(t) = E ωB (ωt − sin ωt), z(t) = E ωB (1 − cos ωt). (5.7) In this form, the answer is not terribly enlightening, but if we let R ≡ E ωB , (5.8) and eliminate the sines and cosines by exploiting the trigonometric identity sin 2 ωt + cos2 ωt = 1, we ﬁnd that (y − Rωt) 2 + (z − R) 2 = R2. (5.9) This is the formula for a circle, of radius R, whose center (0, Rωt, R) travels in the y-direction at a constant speed u = ω R = E B . (5.10) The particle moves as though it were a spot on the rim of a wheel rolling along the y axis. The curve generated in this way is called a cycloid. Notice that the overall motion is not in the direction of E, as you might suppose, but perpendicular to it. One implication of the Lorentz force law (Eq. 5.1) deserves special attention: Magnetic forces do no work. For if Q moves an amount dl = v dt, the work done is dWmag = Fmag · dl = Q(v × B) · v dt = 0. (5.11) This follows because (v × B) is perpendicular to v,so (v × B) · v = 0. Magnetic forces may alter the direction in which a particle moves, but they cannot speed it up or slow it down. The fact that magnetic forces do no work is an elementary and direct consequence of the Lorentz force law, but there are many situations in which it appears so manifestly false that one’s conﬁdence is bound to waver. When a magnetic crane lifts the carcass of a junked car, for instance, something is obviously doing work, and it seems perverse to deny that the magnetic force is responsible. Well, perverse or not, deny it we must, and it can be a very subtle matter to ﬁgure out who does deserve the credit in such circumstances. We’ll see a cute example in the next section, but the full story will have to await Chapter 8. Problem 5.1 A particle of charge q enters a region of uniform magnetic ﬁeld B (pointing into the page). The ﬁeld deﬂects the particle a distance d above the original line of ﬂight, as shown in Fig. 5.8. Is the charge positive or negative? In terms of a, d, B and q, ﬁnd the momentum of the particle. 216 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics aq dv Field region FIGURE 5.8 Problem 5.2 Find and sketch the trajectory of the particle in Ex. 5.2, if it starts at the origin with velocity (a) v(0) = (E/B)ˆy, (b) v(0) = (E/2B)ˆy, (c) v(0) = (E/B)(ˆy + ˆz). Problem 5.3 In 1897, J. J. Thomson “discovered” the electron by measuring the charge-to-mass ratio of “cathode rays” (actually, streams of electrons, with charge q and mass m) as follows: (a) First he passed the beam through uniform crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B (mutually perpendicular, and both of them perpendicular to the beam), and adjusted the electric ﬁeld until he got zero deﬂection. What, then, was the speed of the particles (in terms of E and B)? (b) Then he turned off the electric ﬁeld, and measured the radius of curvature, R, of the beam, as deﬂected by the magnetic ﬁeld alone. In terms of E, B,and R, what is the charge-to-mass ratio (q/m) of the particles? 5.1.3 Currents The current in a wire is the charge per unit time passing a given point. By def- inition, negative charges moving to the left count the same as positive ones to the right. This conveniently reﬂects the physical fact that almost all phenomena involving moving charges depend on the product of charge and velocity—if you reverse the signs of q and v, you get the same answer, so it doesn’t really mat- ter which you have. (The Lorentz force law is a case in point; the Hall effect (Prob. 5.41) is a notorious exception.) In practice, it is ordinarily the negatively charged electrons that do the moving—in the direction opposite to the electric current. To avoid the petty complications this entails, I shall often pretend it’s the positive charges that move, as in fact everyone assumed they did for a century or so after Benjamin Franklin established his unfortunate convention. 5 Current is measured in coulombs-per-second, or amperes (A): 1A = 1C/s. (5.12) 5If we called the electron plus and the proton minus, the problem would never arise. In the context of Franklin’s experiments with cat’s fur and glass rods, the choice was completely arbitrary. 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 217 λ vΔt v P FIGURE 5.9 A line charge λ traveling down a wire at speed v (Fig. 5.9) constitutes a current I = λv, (5.13) because a segment of length v\u0004t, carrying charge λv\u0004t, passes point P in a time interval \u0004t. Current is actually a vector: I = λv. (5.14) Because the path of the ﬂow is dictated by the shape of the wire, one doesn’t ordinarily bother to display the direction of I explicitly, 6 but when it comes to surface and volume currents we cannot afford to be so casual, and for the sake of notational consistency it is a good idea to acknowledge the vectorial character of currents right from the start. A neutral wire, of course, contains as many stationary positive charges as mobile negative ones. The former do not contribute to the current—the charge density λ in Eq. 5.13 refers only to the moving charges. In the unusual situation where both types move, I = λ+v+ + λ−v−. The magnetic force on a segment of current-carrying wire is Fmag = ∫ (v × B) dq = ∫ (v × B)λ dl = ∫ (I × B) dl. (5.15) Inasmuch as I and dl both point in the same direction, we can just as well write this as Fmag = ∫ I (dl × B). (5.16) Typically, the current is constant (in magnitude) along the wire, and in that case I comes outside the integral: Fmag = I ∫ (dl × B). (5.17) Example 5.3. A rectangular loop of wire, supporting a mass m, hangs vertically with one end in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B, which points into the page in the shaded region of Fig. 5.10. For what current I, in the loop, would the magnetic force upward exactly balance the gravitational force downward? 6For the same reason, if you are describing a locomotive constrained to move along a speciﬁed track, you would probably speak of its speed, rather than its velocity. 218 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics a m FIGURE 5.10 Solution First of all, the current must circulate clockwise, in order for (I × B) in the hori- zontal segment to point upward. The force is Fmag = IBa, where a is the width of the loop. (The magnetic forces on the two vertical seg- ments cancel.) For Fmag to balance the weight (mg), we must therefore have I = mg Ba . (5.18) The weight just hangs there, suspended in mid-air! What happens if we now increase the current? Then the upward magnetic force exceeds the downward force of gravity, and the loop rises, lifting the weight. Somebody’s doing work, and it sure looks as though the magnetic force is re- sponsible. Indeed, one is tempted to write Wmag = Fmagh = IBah, (5.19) where h is the distance the loop rises. But we know that magnetic forces never do work. What’s going on here? Well, when the loop starts to rise, the charges in the wire are no longer moving horizontally—their velocity now acquires an upward component u, the speed of the loop (Fig. 5.11), in addition to the horizontal component w associated with the current (I = λw). The magnetic force, which is always perpendicular to the velocity, no longer points straight up, but tilts back. It is perpendicular to the net displacement of the charge (which is in the direction of v), and therefore it does no work on q. It does have a vertical component (qw B); indeed, the net vertical force on all the charge (λa) in the upper segment of the loop is Fvert = λaw B = IBa (5.20) (as before); but now it also has a horizontal component (qu B), which opposes the ﬂow of current. Whoever is in charge of maintaining that current, therefore, must now push those charges along, against the backward component of the mag- netic force. 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 219 q u v w Fmag qwB quB FIGURE 5.11 The total horizontal force on the top segment is Fhoriz = λau B. (5.21) In a time dt, the charges move a (horizontal) distance w dt, so the work done by this agency (presumably a battery or a generator) is Wbattery = λaB ∫ uw dt = IBah, which is precisely what we naïvely attributed to the magnetic force in Eq. 5.19. Was work done in this process? Absolutely! Who did it? The battery! What, then, was the role of the magnetic force? Well, it redirected the horizontal force of the battery into the vertical motion of the loop and the weight.7 N Fmop FIGURE 5.12 It may help to consider a mechanical analogy. Imagine you’re sliding a trunk up a frictionless ramp, by pushing on it horizontally with a mop (Fig. 5.12). The normal force (N) does no work, because it is perpendicular to the displacement. But it does have a vertical component (which in fact is what lifts the trunk), and a (backward) horizontal component (which you have to overcome by pushing on the mop). Who is doing the work here? You are, obviously—and yet your force (which is purely horizontal) is not (at least, not directly) what lifts the box. The 7If you like, the vertical component of Fmag does work lifting the car, but the horizontal component does equal negative work opposing the current. However you look at it, the net work done by the magnetic force is zero. 220 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics normal force plays the same passive (but crucial) role as the magnetic force in Ex. 5.3: while doing no work itself, it redirects the efforts of the active agent (you, or the battery, as the case may be), from horizontal to vertical. When charge ﬂows over a surface, we describe it by the surface current den- sity, K, deﬁned as follows: Consider a “ribbon” of inﬁnitesimal width dl⊥, run- ning parallel to the ﬂow (Fig. 5.13). If the current in this ribbon is dI, the surface current density is K ≡ dI dl⊥ . (5.22) In words, K is the current per unit width. In particular, if the (mobile) surface charge density is σ and its velocity is v, then K = σ v. (5.23) In general, K will vary from point to point over the surface, reﬂecting variations in σ and/or v. The magnetic force on the surface current is Fmag = ∫ (v × B)σ da = ∫ (K × B) da. (5.24) Caveat:Justas E suffers a discontinuity at a surface charge,so B is discontinuous at a surface current. In Eq. 5.24, you must be careful to use the average ﬁeld, just as we did in Sect. 2.5.3. When the ﬂow of charge is distributed throughout a three-dimensional region, we describe it by the volume current density, J, deﬁned as follows: Consider a “tube” of inﬁnitesimal cross section da⊥, running parallel to the ﬂow (Fig. 5.14). If the current in this tube is dI, the volume current density is J ≡ dI da⊥ . (5.25) In words, J is the current per unit area. If the (mobile) volume charge density is ρ and the velocity is v, then J = ρv. (5.26) dl⊥ Flow K FIGURE 5.13 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 221 Flow J da⊥ FIGURE 5.14 The magnetic force on a volume current is therefore Fmag = ∫ (v × B)ρ dτ = ∫ (J × B) dτ. (5.27) Example 5.4. (a) A current I is uniformly distributed over a wire of circular cross section, with radius a (Fig. 5.15). Find the volume current density J . Solution The area (perpendicular to the ﬂow) is πa2,so J = I πa2 . This was trivial because the current density was uniform. (b) Suppose the current density in the wire is proportional to the distance from the axis, J = ks (for some constant k). Find the total current in the wire. a I FIGURE 5.15 ds sdφ FIGURE 5.16 Solution Because J varies with s,wemust integrate Eq. 5.25. The current through the shaded patch (Fig. 5.16) is Jda⊥, and da⊥ = sdsdφ.So I = ∫ (ks)(sdsdφ) = 2π k ∫ a 0 s2 ds = 2πka3 3 . 222 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics According to Eq. 5.25, the total current crossing a surface S can be written as I = ∫ S Jda⊥ = ∫ S J · da. (5.28) (The dot product serves neatly to pick out the appropriate component of da.) In particular, the charge per unit time leaving a volume V is ∮ S J · da = ∫ V (∇ · J) dτ. Because charge is conserved, whatever ﬂows out through the surface must come at the expense of what remains inside: ∫ V (∇ · J) dτ =− d dt ∫ V ρ dτ =− ∫ V ( ∂ρ ∂t ) dτ. (The minus sign reﬂects the fact that an outward ﬂow decreases the charge left in V.) Since this applies to any volume, we conclude that ∇ · J =− ∂ρ ∂t . (5.29) This is the precise mathematical statement of local charge conservation; it is called the continuity equation. For future reference, let me summarize the “dictionary” we have implicitly de- veloped for translating equations into the forms appropriate to point, line, surface, and volume currents: n∑ i=1 ()qi vi ∼ ∫ line()I dl ∼ ∫ surface()K da ∼ ∫ volume()J dτ. (5.30) This correspondence, which is analogous to q ∼ λ dl ∼ σ da ∼ ρ dτ for the var- ious charge distributions, generates Eqs. 5.15, 5.24, and 5.27 from the original Lorentz force law (5.1). Problem 5.4 Suppose that the magnetic ﬁeld in some region has the form B = kz ˆx (where k is a constant). Find the force on a square loop (side a), lying in the yz plane and centered at the origin, if it carries a current I , ﬂowing counterclockwise, when you look down the x axis. Problem 5.5 A current I ﬂows down a wire of radius a. (a) If it is uniformly distributed over the surface, what is the surface current den- sity K ? (b) If it is distributed in such a way that the volume current density is inversely proportional to the distance from the axis, what is J (s)? 5.2 The Biot-Savart Law 223 Problem 5.6 (a) A phonograph record carries a uniform density of “static electricity” σ .Ifit rotates at angular velocity ω, what is the surface current density K at a distance r from the center? (b) A uniformly charged solid sphere, of radius R and total charge Q, is centered at the origin and spinning at a constant angular velocity ω about the z axis. Find the current density J at any point (r , θ , φ) within the sphere. Problem 5.7 For a conﬁguration of charges and currents conﬁned within a volume V, show that ∫ V J dτ = dp/dt, (5.31) where p is the total dipole moment. [Hint: evaluate ∫ V ∇ · (xJ) dτ .] 5.2 THE BIOT-SAVART LAW 5.2.1 Steady Currents Stationary charges produce electric ﬁelds that are constant in time; hence the term electrostatics.8 Steady currents produce magnetic ﬁelds that are constant in time; the theory of steady currents is called magnetostatics. Stationary charges ⇒ constant electric ﬁelds: electrostatics. Steady currents ⇒ constant magnetic ﬁelds: magnetostatics. By steady current I mean a continuous ﬂow that has been going on forever, without change and without charge piling up anywhere. (Some people call them “stationary currents”; to my ear, that’s a contradiction in terms.) Formally, electro/magnetostatics is the régime ∂ρ ∂t = 0, ∂J ∂t = 0, (5.32) at all places and all times. Of course, there’s no such thing in practice as a truly steady current, any more than there is a truly stationary charge. In this sense, both electrostatics and magnetostatics describe artiﬁcial worlds that exist only in textbooks. However, they represent suitable approximations as long as the actual ﬂuctuations are remote, or gradual—in fact, for most purposes magnetostatics applies very well to household currents, which alternate 120 times a second! 8Actually, it is not necessary that the charges be stationary, but only that the charge density at each point be constant. For example, the sphere in Prob. 5.6(b) produces an electrostatic ﬁeld 1/4πϵ0(Q/r 2)ˆr, even though it is rotating, because ρ does not depend on t. 224 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics Notice that a moving point charge cannot possibly constitute a steady current. If it’s here one instant, it’s gone the next. This may seem like a minor thing to you, but it’s a major headache for me. I developed each topic in electrostatics by starting out with the simple case of a point charge at rest; then I generalized to an arbitrary charge distribution by invoking the superposition principle. This approach is not open to us in magnetostatics because a moving point charge does not produce a static ﬁeld in the ﬁrst place. We are forced to deal with extended current distributions right from the start, and, as a result, the arguments are bound to be more cumbersome. When a steady current ﬂows in a wire, its magnitude I must be the same all along the line; otherwise, charge would be piling up somewhere, and it wouldn’t be a steady current. More generally, since ∂ρ/∂t = 0 in magnetostatics, the con- tinuity equation (5.29) becomes ∇ · J = 0. (5.33) 5.2.2 The Magnetic Field of a Steady Current The magnetic ﬁeld of a steady line current is given by the Biot-Savart law: B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ I × ˆr r2 dl ′ = μ0 4π I ∫ dl′ × ˆr r2 . (5.34) The integration is along the current path, in the direction of the ﬂow; dl ′ is an element of length along the wire, and r, as always, is the vector from the source to the point r (Fig. 5.17). The constant μ0 is called the permeability of free space:9 μ0 = 4π × 10 −7 N/A 2. (5.35) These units are such that B itself comes out in newtons per ampere-meter (as required by the Lorentz force law), or teslas (T): 10 1T = 1N/(A · m). (5.36) dl′ I r r FIGURE 5.17 9This is an exact number, not an empirical constant. It serves (via Eq. 5.40) to deﬁne the ampere, and the ampere in turn deﬁnes the coulomb. 10For some reason, in this one case the cgs unit (the gauss) is more commonly used than the SI unit: 1 tesla = 104 gauss. The earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is about half a gauss; a fairly strong laboratory magnetic ﬁeld is, say, 10,000 gauss. 5.2 The Biot-Savart Law 225 As the starting point for magnetostatics, the Biot-Savart law plays a role analo- gous to Coulomb’s law in electrostatics. Indeed, the 1/r2 dependence is common to both laws. Example 5.5. Find the magnetic ﬁeld a distance s from a long straight wire carrying a steady current I (Fig. 5.18). s dl′ l′ I P θ α r FIGURE 5.18 I θ1 θ2 Wire segment FIGURE 5.19 Solution In the diagram, (dl′ × ˆr) points out of the page, and has the magnitude dl ′ sin α = dl ′ cos θ. Also, l ′ = s tan θ ,so dl ′ = s cos2 θ dθ, and s = r cos θ ,so 1 r2 = cos2 θ s2 . Thus B = μ0 I 4π ∫ θ2 θ1 ( cos2 θ s2 )( s cos2 θ ) cos θ dθ = μ0 I 4π s ∫ θ2 θ1 cos θ dθ = μ0 I 4π s (sin θ2 − sin θ1). (5.37) Equation 5.37 gives the ﬁeld of any straight segment of wire, in terms of the initial and ﬁnal angles θ1 and θ2 (Fig. 5.19). Of course, a ﬁnite segment by itself 226 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics could never support a steady current (where would the charge go when it got to the end?), but it might be a piece of some closed circuit, and Eq. 5.37 would then represent its contribution to the total ﬁeld. In the case of an inﬁnite wire, θ1 =−π/2 and θ2 = π/2, so we obtain B = μ0 I 2π s . (5.38) Notice that the ﬁeld is inversely proportional to the distance from the wire— just like the electric ﬁeld of an inﬁnite line charge. In the region below the wire, B points into the page, and in general, it “circles around” the wire, in accordance with the right-hand rule (Fig. 5.3): B = μ0 I 2π s ˆφ. (5.39) As an application, let’s ﬁnd the force of attraction between two long, parallel wires a distance d apart, carrying currents I1 and I2 (Fig. 5.20). The ﬁeld at (2) due to (1) is B = μ0 I1 2π d , and it points into the page. The Lorentz force law (in the form appropriate to line currents, Eq. 5.17) predicts a force directed towards (1), of magnitude F = I2 ( μ0 I1 2π d ) ∫ dl. The total force, not surprisingly, is inﬁnite, but the force per unit length is f = μ0 2π I1 I2 d . (5.40) If the currents are antiparallel (one up, one down), the force is repulsive— consistent again with the qualitative observations in Sect. 5.1.1. I1 I2 d (1) (2) FIGURE 5.20 5.2 The Biot-Savart Law 227 Example 5.6. Find the magnetic ﬁeld a distance z above the center of a circular loop of radius R, which carries a steady current I (Fig. 5.21). B θ θ d B dl′ z R r FIGURE 5.21 Solution The ﬁeld dB attributable to the segment dl′ points as shown. As we integrate dl′ around the loop, dB sweeps out a cone. The horizontal components cancel, and the vertical components combine, to give B(z) = μ0 4π I ∫ dl ′ r2 cos θ. (Notice that dl′ and r are perpendicular, in this case; the factor of cos θ projects out the vertical component.) Now, cos θ and r 2 are constants, and ∫ dl ′ is simply the circumference, 2π R,so B(z) = μ0 I 4π ( cos θ r2 ) 2π R = μ0 I 2 R2 (R2 + z2)3/2 . (5.41) For surface and volume currents, the Biot-Savart law becomes B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ K(r ′) × ˆr r2 da′ and B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′) × ˆr r2 dτ ′, (5.42) respectively. You might be tempted to write down the corresponding formula for a moving point charge, using the “dictionary” (Eq. 5.30): B(r) = μ0 4π qv × ˆr r2 , (5.43) 228 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics but this is simply wrong.11 As I mentioned earlier, a point charge does not con- stitute a steady current, and the Biot-Savart law, which only holds for steady cur- rents, does not correctly determine its ﬁeld. The superposition principle applies to magnetic ﬁelds just as it does to electric ﬁelds: if you have a collection of source currents, the net ﬁeld is the (vector) sum of the ﬁelds due to each of them taken separately. Problem 5.8 (a) Find the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of a square loop, which carries a steady current I .Let R be the distance from center to side (Fig. 5.22). (b) Find the ﬁeld at the center of a regular n-sided polygon, carrying a steady cur- rent I .Again,let R be the distance from the center to any side. (c) Check that your formula reduces to the ﬁeld at the center of a circular loop, in the limit n →∞.

Express your answer in terms of θ1 and θ2 (it’s easiest that way). Consider the turns to be essentially circu- lar, and use the result of Ex. 5.6. What is the ﬁeld on the axis of an inﬁnite solenoid (inﬁnite in both directions)? θ2 θ1 P a FIGURE 5.25 Problem 5.12 Use the result of Ex. 5.6 to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell, of radius R and total charge Q, spinning at constant angular velocity ω. Problem 5.13 Suppose you have two inﬁnite straight line charges λ, a distance d apart, moving along at a constant speed v (Fig. 5.26). How great would v have to be in order for the magnetic attraction to balance the electrical repulsion? Work out the actual number. Is this a reasonable sort of speed?12 d λ λ \u0002 \u0002 FIGURE 5.26 5.3 THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF B 5.3.1 Straight-Line Currents The magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnite straight wire is shown in Fig. 5.27 (the current is coming out of the page). At a glance, it is clear that this ﬁeld has a nonzero curl (something you’ll never see in an electrostatic ﬁeld); let’s calculate it. According to Eq. 5.38, the integral of B around a circular path of radius s, centered at the wire, is ∮ B · dl = ∮ μ0 I 2π s dl = μ0 I 2π s ∮ dl = μ0 I. Notice that the answer is independent of s; that’s because Bdecreases at the same rate as the circumference increases. In fact, it doesn’t have to be a circle; any old 12If you’ve studied special relativity, you may be tempted to look for complexities in this problem that are not really there—λ and v are both measured in the laboratory frame, and this is ordinary electrostatics. 230 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics B FIGURE 5.27 loop that encloses the wire would give the same answer. For if we use cylindrical coordinates (s, φ, z), with the current ﬂowing along the z axis, B = (μ0 I /2π s) ˆφ and dl = ds ˆs + sdφ ˆφ + dz ˆz,so ∮ B · dl = μ0 I 2π ∮ 1 s sdφ = μ0 I 2π ∫ 2π 0 dφ = μ0 I. This assumes the loop encircles the wire exactly once; if it went around twice, then φ would run from 0 to 4π , and if it didn’t enclose the wire at all, then φ would go from φ1 to φ2 and back again, with ∫ dφ = 0 (Fig. 5.28). Now suppose we have a bundle of straight wires. Each wire that passes through our loop contributes μ0 I , and those outside contribute nothing (Fig. 5.29). The line integral will then be ∮ B · dl = μ0 Ienc, (5.44) where Ienc stands for the total current enclosed by the integration path. If the ﬂow of charge is represented by a volume current density J, the enclosed current is Ienc = ∫ J · da, (5.45) Wire Loop φ2 φ1 FIGURE 5.28 I5 I1 I2 I3 I4 FIGURE 5.29 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 231 with the integral taken over any surface bounded by the loop. Applying Stokes’ theorem to Eq. 5.44, then, ∫ (∇ × B) · da = μ0 ∫ J · da, and hence ∇ × B = μ0J. (5.46) With minimal labor, we have actually obtained the general formula for the curl of B. But our derivation is seriously ﬂawed by the restriction to inﬁnite straight line currents (and combinations thereof). Most current conﬁgurations cannot be constructed out of inﬁnite straight wires, and we have no right to assume that Eq. 5.46 applies to them. So the next section is devoted to the formal derivation of the divergence and curl of B, starting from the Biot-Savart law itself. 5.3.2 The Divergence and Curl of B The Biot-Savart law for the general case of a volume current reads B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′) × ˆr r2 dτ ′. (5.47) This formula gives the magnetic ﬁeld at a point r = (x, y, z) in terms of an inte- gral over the current distribution J(x ′, y′, z′) (Fig. 5.30). It is best to be absolutely explicit at this stage: B is a function of (x, y, z), J is a function of (x ′, y′, z′), r = (x − x ′) ˆx + (y − y′) ˆy + (z − z′) ˆz, dτ ′ = dx ′ dy′ dz′. The integration is over the primed coordinates; the divergence and the curl of B are with respect to the unprimed coordinates. r (x, y, z) (x′, y′, z′) dτ′ r FIGURE 5.30 232 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics Applying the divergence to Eq. 5.47, we obtain: ∇ · B = μ0 4π ∫ ∇ · ( J × ˆr r2 ) dτ ′. (5.48) Invoking product rule number 6, ∇ · ( J × ˆr r2 ) = ˆr r2 · (∇ × J) − J · ( ∇ × ˆr r2 ) . (5.49) But ∇ × J = 0, because J doesn’t depend on the unprimed variables, while ∇ × (ˆr/r2) = 0 (Prob. 1.63), so ∇ · B = 0. (5.50) Evidently the divergence of the magnetic ﬁeld is zero. Applying the curl to Eq. 5.47, we obtain: ∇ × B = μ0 4π ∫ ∇ × (J × ˆr r2 ) dτ ′. (5.51) Again, our strategy is to expand the integrand, using the appropriate product rule—in this case number 8: ∇ × ( J × ˆr r2 ) = J (∇ · ˆr r2 ) − (J · ∇) ˆr r2 . (5.52) (I have dropped terms involving derivatives of J, because J does not depend on x, y, z.) The second term integrates to zero, as we’ll see in the next paragraph. The ﬁrst term involves the divergence we were at pains to calculate in Chapter 1 (Eq. 1.100): ∇ · ( ˆr r2 ) = 4πδ3(r). (5.53) Thus ∇ × B = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′)4πδ3(r − r ′) dτ ′ = μ0J(r), which conﬁrms that Eq. 5.46 is not restricted to straight-line currents, but holds quite generally in magnetostatics. To complete the argument, however, we must check that the second term in Eq. 5.52 integrates to zero. Because the derivative acts only on ˆr/r2, we can switch from ∇ to ∇′ at the cost of a minus sign:13 −(J · ∇) ˆr r2 = (J · ∇′) ˆr r2 . (5.54) 13The point here is that r depends only on the difference between the coordinates; note that (∂/∂ x) f (x − x ′) =−(∂/∂ x ′) f (x − x ′). 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 233 The x component, in particular, is (J · ∇′) ( x − x ′ r3 ) = ∇′ · [ (x − x ′) r3 J ] − ( x − x ′ r3 ) (∇′ · J) (using product rule 5). Now, for steady currents the divergence of J is zero (Eq. 5.33), so [−(J · ∇) r r2 ] x = ∇′ · [ (x − x ′) r3 J ] , and therefore this contribution to the integral (Eq. 5.51) can be written ∫ V ∇′ · [ (x − x ′) r3 J ] dτ ′ = ∮ S (x − x ′) r3 J · da ′. (5.55) (The reason for switching from ∇ to ∇′ was to permit this integration by parts.) But what region are we integrating over? Well, it’s the volume that appears in the Biot-Savart law (Eq. 5.47)—large enough, that is, to include all the current. You can make it bigger than that, if you like; J = 0 out there anyway, so it will add nothing to the integral. The essential point is that on the boundary the cur- rent is zero (all current is safely inside) and hence the surface integral (Eq. 5.55) vanishes.14 5.3.3 Ampère’s Law The equation for the curl of B, ∇ × B = μ0J, (5.56) is called Ampère’s law (in differential form). It can be converted to integral form by the usual device of applying one of the fundamental theorems—in this case Stokes’ theorem: ∫ (∇ × B) · da = ∮ B · dl = μ0 ∫ J · da. Now, ∫ J · da is the total current passing through the surface (Fig. 5.31), which we call Ienc (the current enclosed by the Amperian loop). Thus ∮ B · dl = μ0 Ienc. (5.57) 14If J itself extends to inﬁnity (as in the case of an inﬁnite straight wire), the surface integral is still typically zero, though the analysis calls for greater care. 234 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics Surface Boundary line J FIGURE 5.31 This is the integral version of Ampère’s law; it generalizes Eq. 5.44 to arbi- trary steady currents. Notice that Eq. 5.57 inherits the sign ambiguity of Stokes’ theorem (Sect. 1.3.5): Which way around the loop am I supposed to go? And which direction through the surface corresponds to a “positive” current? The res- olution, as always, is the right-hand rule: If the ﬁngers of your right hand indicate the direction of integration around the boundary, then your thumb deﬁnes the direction of a positive current. Just as the Biot-Savart law plays a role in magnetostatics that Coulomb’s law assumed in electrostatics, so Ampère’s plays the part of Gauss’s: { Electrostatics : Coulomb → Gauss, Magnetostatics : Biot−Savart → Ampère. In particular, for currents with appropriate symmetry, Ampère’s law in integral form offers a lovely and extraordinarily efﬁcient way of calculating the magnetic ﬁeld. Example 5.7. Find the magnetic ﬁeld a distance s from a long straight wire (Fig. 5.32), carrying a steady current I (the same problem we solved in Ex. 5.5, using the Biot-Savart law). Solution We know the direction of B is “circumferential,” circling around the wire as indi- cated by the right-hand rule. By symmetry, the magnitude of B is constant around an Amperian loop of radius s, centered on the wire. So Ampère’s law gives ∮ B · dl = B ∮ dl = B2π s = μ0 Ienc = μ0 I, or B = μ0 I 2π s . This is the same answer we got before (Eq. 5.38), but it was obtained this time with far less effort. 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 235 s B I Amperian loop FIGURE 5.32 Sheet of current Amperian loop z y x l K FIGURE 5.33 Example 5.8. Find the magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnite uniform surface current K = K ˆx, ﬂowing over the xy plane (Fig. 5.33). Solution First of all, what is the direction of B?Couldithaveany x component? No:A glance at the Biot-Savart law (Eq. 5.42) reveals that B is perpendicular to K. Could it have a z component? No again. You could conﬁrm this by noting that any vertical contribution from a ﬁlament at +y is canceled by the corresponding ﬁlament at −y. But there is a nicer argument: Suppose the ﬁeld pointed away from the plane. By reversing the direction of the current, I could make it point toward the plane (in the Biot-Savart law, changing the sign of the current switches the sign of the ﬁeld). But the z component of B cannot possibly depend on the direction of the current in the xy plane. (Think about it!) So B can only have a y component, and a quick check with your right hand should convince you that it points to the left above the plane and to the right below it. With this in mind, we draw a rectangular Amperian loop as shown in Fig. 5.33, parallel to the yz plane and extending an equal distance above and below the surface. Applying Ampère’s law, ∮ B · dl = 2Bl = μ0 Ienc = μ0 Kl, (one Bl comes from the top segment and the other from the bottom), so B = (μ0/2)K , or, more precisely, B = { +(μ0/2)K ˆy for z < 0, −(μ0/2)K ˆy for z > 0. (5.58) Notice that the ﬁeld is independent of the distance from the plane, just like the electric ﬁeld of a uniform surface charge (Ex. 2.5). Example 5.9. Find the magnetic ﬁeld of a very long solenoid, consisting of n closely wound turns per unit length on a cylinder of radius R, each carrying a steady current I (Fig. 5.34). [The point of making the windings so close is that one can then pretend each turn is circular. If this troubles you (after all, there is a net current I in the direction of the solenoid’s axis, no matter how tight the 236 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics R I I FIGURE 5.34 K FIGURE 5.35 winding), picture instead a sheet of aluminum foil wrapped around the cylin- der, carrying the equivalent uniform surface current K = nI (Fig. 5.35). Or make a double winding, going up to one end and then—always in the same sense— going back down again, thereby eliminating the net longitudinal current. But, in truth, this is all unnecessary fastidiousness, for the ﬁeld inside a solenoid is huge (relatively speaking), and the ﬁeld of the longitudinal current is at most a tiny reﬁnement.] Solution First of all, what is the direction of B? Could it have a radial component? No.For suppose Bs were positive; if we reversed the direction of the current, Bs would then be negative. But switching I is physically equivalent to turning the solenoid upside down, and that certainly should not alter the radial ﬁeld. How about a “circumferential” component? No.For Bφ would be constant around an Amperian loop concentric with the solenoid (Fig. 5.36), and hence ∮ B · dl = Bφ(2π s) = μ0 Ienc = 0, since the loop encloses no current. So the magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnite, closely wound solenoid runs parallel to the axis. From the right-hand rule, we expect that it points upward inside the solenoid and downward outside. Moreover, it certainly approaches zero as you go very far s Amperian loop FIGURE 5.36 Amperian loops L b a 2 1 FIGURE 5.37 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 237 away. With this in mind, let’s apply Ampère’s law to the two rectangular loops in Fig. 5.37. Loop 1 lies entirely outside the solenoid, with its sides at distances a and b from the axis: ∮ B · dl =[B(a) − B(b)]L = μ0 Ienc = 0, so B(a) = B(b). Evidently the ﬁeld outside does not depend on the distance from the axis.But we agreed that it goes to zero for large s. It must therefore be zero everywhere!(This astonishing result can also be derived from the Biot-Savart law, of course, but it’s much more difﬁcult. See Prob. 5.46.) As for loop 2, which is half inside and half outside, Ampère’s law gives ∮ B · dl = BL = μ0 Ienc = μ0nI L , where B is the ﬁeld inside the solenoid. (The right side of the loop contributes nothing, since B = 0 out there.) Conclusion: B = { μ0nI ˆz, inside the solenoid, 0, outside the solenoid. (5.59) Notice that the ﬁeld inside is uniform—it doesn’t depend on the distance from the axis. In this sense the solenoid is to magnetostatics what the parallel-plate capacitor is to electrostatics: a simple device for producing strong uniform ﬁelds. Like Gauss’s law, Ampère’s law is always true (for steady currents), but it is not always useful. Only when the symmetry of the problem enables you to pull B outside the integral ∮ B · dl can you calculate the magnetic ﬁeld from Ampère’s law. When it does work, it’s by far the fastest method; when it doesn’t, you have to fall back on the Biot-Savart law. The current conﬁgurations that can be handled by Ampère’s law are 1. Inﬁnite straight lines (prototype: Ex. 5.7). 2. Inﬁnite planes (prototype: Ex. 5.8). 3. Inﬁnite solenoids (prototype: Ex. 5.9). 4. Toroids (prototype: Ex. 5.10). The last of these is a surprising and elegant application of Ampère’s law. As in Exs. 5.8 and 5.9, the hard part is ﬁguring out the direction of the ﬁeld (which we will now have done, once and for all, for each of the four geometries); the actual application of Ampère’s law takes only one line. 238 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics Example 5.10. A toroidal coil consists of a circular ring, or “donut,” around which a long wire is wrapped (Fig. 5.38). The winding is uniform and tight enough so that each turn can be considered a plane closed loop. The cross- sectional shape of the coil is immaterial. I made it rectangular in Fig. 5.38 for the sake of simplicity, but it could just as well be circular or even some weird asymmetrical form, as in Fig. 5.39, as long as the shape remains the same all the way around the ring. In that case, it follows that the magnetic ﬁeld of the toroid is circumferential at all points, both inside and outside the coil. FIGURE 5.38 Proof. According to the Biot-Savart law, the ﬁeld at r due to the current element at r ′ is dB = μ0 4π I × r r3 dl ′. We may as well put r in the xz plane (Fig. 5.39), so its Cartesian components are (x, 0, z), while the source coordinates are r ′ = (s′ cos φ′, s′ sin φ′, z′). z′ s′ x y z z x φ′−φ′ r r r′ r′′ q q FIGURE 5.39 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 239 Then r = (x − s′ cos φ′, −s′ sin φ′, z − z′). Since the current has no φ component, I = Is ˆs + Iz ˆz, or (in Cartesian coordi- nates) I = (Is cos φ′, Is sin φ′, Iz). Accordingly, I × r = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ ˆx ˆy ˆz Is cos φ′ Is sin φ′ Iz (x − s′ cos φ′)(−s′ sin φ′)(z − z′) ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ = [sin φ′ (Is(z − z′) + s′ Iz)] ˆx + [Iz(x − s′ cos φ′) − Is cos φ′(z − z′)] ˆy + [−Is x sin φ′] ˆz. But there is a symmetrically situated current element at r ′′, with the same s′,the same r,the same dl ′,the same Is, and the same Iz, but negative φ′ (Fig. 5.39). Because sin φ′ changes sign, the ˆx and ˆz contributions from r ′ and r ′′ cancel, leaving only a ˆy term. Thus the ﬁeld at r is in the ˆy direction, and in general the ﬁeld points in the ˆφ direction. □ Now that we know the ﬁeld is circumferential, determining its magnitude is ridiculously easy. Just apply Ampère’s law to a circle of radius s about the axis of the toroid: B2πs = μ0 Ienc, and hence B(r) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ μ0 NI 2π s ˆφ, for points inside the coil, 0, for points outside the coil, (5.60) where N is the total number of turns. Problem 5.14 A steady current I ﬂows down a long cylindrical wire of radius a (Fig. 5.40). Find the magnetic ﬁeld, both inside and outside the wire, if (a) The current is uniformly distributed over the outside surface of the wire. (b) The current is distributed in such a way that J is proportional to s, the distance from the axis. 240 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics a I FIGURE 5.40 z y x J +a −a FIGURE 5.41 Problem 5.15 A thick slab extending from z =−a to z =+a (and inﬁnite in the x and y directions) carries a uniform volume current J = J ˆx (Fig. 5.41). Find the magnetic ﬁeld, as a function of z, both inside and outside the slab. Problem 5.16 Two long coaxial solenoids each carry current I , but in opposite directions, as shown in Fig. 5.42. The inner solenoid (radius a)has n1 turns per unit length, and the outer one (radius b)has n2. Find B in each of the three regions: (i) inside the inner solenoid, (ii) between them, and (iii) outside both.

(a) Find the magnetic ﬁeld between the plates and also above and below them. (b) Find the magnetic force per unit area on the upper plate, including its direction. (c) At what speed v would the magnetic force balance the electrical force? 15 Problem 5.18 Show that the magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnite solenoid runs parallel to! the axis, regardless of the cross-sectional shape of the coil, as long as that shape is constant along the length of the solenoid. What is the magnitude of the ﬁeld, inside and outside of such a coil? Show that the toroid ﬁeld (Eq. 5.60) reduces to the solenoid ﬁeld, when the radius of the donut is so large that a segment can be considered essentially straight. Problem 5.19 In calculating the current enclosed by an Amperian loop, one must, in general, evaluate an integral of the form Ienc = ∫ S J · da. 15See footnote to Prob. 5.13. 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 241 The trouble is, there are inﬁnitely many surfaces that share the same boundary line. Which one are we supposed to use? 5.3.4 Comparison of Magnetostatics and Electrostatics The divergence and curl of the electrostatic ﬁeld are ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ, (Gauss’s law); ∇ × E = 0,(no name). These are Maxwell’s equations for electrostatics. Together with the boundary condition E → 0 far from all charges, 16 Maxwell’s equations determine the ﬁeld, if the source charge density ρ is given; they contain essentially the same infor- mation as Coulomb’s law plus the principle of superposition. The divergence and curl of the magnetostatic ﬁeld are ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ ∇ · B = 0,(no name); ∇ × B = μ0J, (Ampère’s law). These are Maxwell’s equations for magnetostatics. Again, together with the boundary condition B → 0 far from all currents, Maxwell’s equations determine the magnetic ﬁeld; they are equivalent to the Biot-Savart law (plus superposition). Maxwell’s equations and the force law F = Q(E + v × B) constitute the most elegant formulation of electrostatics and magnetostatics. The electric ﬁeld diverges away from a (positive) charge; the magnetic ﬁeld line curls around a current (Fig. 5.44). Electric ﬁeld lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative ones; magnetic ﬁeld lines do not begin or end anywhere—to do so would require a nonzero divergence. They typically form closed loops or extend out to inﬁnity.17 To put it another way, there are no point sources for B, as there are for E; there exists no magnetic analog to electric charge. This is the physical content of the statement ∇ · B = 0. Coulomb and others believed that magnetism was produced by magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles, as we would now call them), and in some older books you will still ﬁnd references to a magnetic version of Coulomb’s law, giving the force of at- traction or repulsion between them. It was Ampère who ﬁrst speculated that all magnetic effects are attributable to electric charges in motion (currents). As far 16In those artiﬁcial problems where the charge (or current) extends to inﬁnity—inﬁnite planes, for example—symmetry considerations can sometimes take the place of boundary conditions. 17A third possibility turns out to be surprisingly common: they can form chaotic tangles. See M. Lieberherr, Am. J. Phys. 78, 1117 (2010). 242 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics (a) Electrostatic field of a point charge (b) Magnetostatic field of a long wire BE FIGURE 5.44 as we know, Ampère was right; nevertheless, it remains an open experimental question whether magnetic monopoles exist in nature (they are obviously pretty rare, or somebody would have found one18), and in fact some recent elementary particle theories require them. For our purposes, though, B is divergenceless, and there are no magnetic monopoles. It takes a moving electric charge to produce a magnetic ﬁeld, and it takes another moving electric charge to “feel” a magnetic ﬁeld. Typically, electric forces are enormously larger than magnetic ones. That’s not something intrinsic to the theory; it has to do with the sizes of the fundamen- tal constants ϵ0 and μ0. In general, it is only when both the source charges and the test charge are moving at velocities comparable to the speed of light that the magnetic force approaches the electric force in strength. (Problems 5.13 and 5.17 illustrate this rule.) How is it, then, that we notice magnetic effects at all? The answer is that both in the production of a magnetic ﬁeld (Biot-Savart) and in its detection (Lorentz), it is the current that matters, and we can compensate for a smallish velocity by pouring huge amounts of charge down the wire. Ordinarily, this charge would simultaneously generate so large an electric force as to swamp the magnetic one. But if we arrange to keep the wire neutral, by embedding in it an equal quantity of opposite charge at rest, the electric ﬁeld cancels out, leaving the magnetic ﬁeld to stand alone. It sounds very elaborate, but of course this is precisely what happens in an ordinary current carrying wire. Problem 5.20 (a) Find the density ρ of mobile charges in a piece of copper, assuming each atom contributes one free electron. [Look up the necessary physical constants.] (b) Calculate the average electron velocity in a copper wire 1 mm in diameter, carrying a current of 1 A. [Note: This is literally a snail’s pace. How, then, can you carry on a long distance telephone conversation?] 18An apparent detection (B. Cabrera, Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1378 (1982)) has never been reproduced— and not for want of trying. For a delightful brief history of ideas about magnetism, see Chapter 1 in D. C. Mattis, The Theory of Magnetism (New York: Harper & Row, 1965). 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 243 (c) What is the force of attraction between two such wires, 1 cm apart? (d) If you could somehow remove the stationary positive charges, what would the electrical repulsion force be? How many times greater than the magnetic force is it? Problem 5.21 Is Ampère’s law consistent with the general rule (Eq. 1.46) that divergence-of-curl is always zero? Show that Ampère’s law cannot be valid, in gen- eral, outside magnetostatics. Is there any such “defect” in the other three Maxwell equations? Problem 5.22 Suppose there did exist magnetic monopoles. How would you mod- ify Maxwell’s equations and the force law to accommodate them? If you think there are several plausible options, list them, and suggest how you might decide experi- mentally which one is right. 5.4 MAGNETIC VECTOR POTENTIAL 5.4.1 The Vector Potential Just as ∇ × E = 0 permitted us to introduce a scalar potential (V ) in electrostatics, E =−∇V, so ∇ · B = 0 invites the introduction of a vector potential A in magnetostatics: B = ∇ × A. (5.61) The former is authorized by Theorem 1 (of Sect. 1.6.2), the latter by Theorem 2 (The proof of Theorem 2 is developed in Prob. 5.31). The potential formulation automatically takes care of ∇ · B = 0 (since the divergence of a curl is always zero); there remains Ampère’s law: ∇ × B = ∇ × (∇ × A) = ∇(∇ · A) −∇2A = μ0J. (5.62) Now, the electric potential had a built-in ambiguity: you can add to V any function whose gradient is zero (which is to say, any constant), without altering the physical quantity E. Likewise, you can add to A any function whose curl vanishes (which is to say, the gradient of any scalar), with no effect on B. We can exploit this freedom to eliminate the divergence of A: ∇ · A = 0. (5.63) To prove that this is always possible, suppose that our original potential, A0, is not divergenceless. If we add to it the gradient of λ (A = A0 + ∇λ), the new divergence is ∇ · A = ∇ · A0 +∇2λ. 244 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics We can accommodate Eq. 5.63, then, if a function λ can be found that satisﬁes ∇2λ =−∇ · A0. But this is mathematically identical to Poisson’s equation (2.24), ∇2V =− ρ ϵ0 , with ∇ · A0 in place of ρ/ϵ0 as the “source.” And we know how to solve Poisson’s equation—that’s what electrostatics is all about (“given the charge distribution, ﬁnd the potential”). In particular, if ρ goes to zero at inﬁnity, the solution is Eq. 2.29: V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ r dτ ′, and by the same token, if ∇ · A0 goes to zero at inﬁnity, then λ = 1 4π ∫ ∇ · A0 r dτ ′. If ∇ · A0 does not go to zero at inﬁnity, we’ll have to use other means to dis- cover the appropriate λ, just as we get the electric potential by other means when the charge distribution extends to inﬁnity. But the essential point remains: It is always possible to make the vector potential divergenceless. To put it the other way around: the deﬁnition B = ∇ × A speciﬁes the curl of A, but it doesn’t say anything about the divergence—we are at liberty to pick that as we see ﬁt, and zero is ordinarily the simplest choice. With this condition on A, Ampère’s law (Eq. 5.62) becomes ∇2A =−μ0J. (5.64) This again is nothing but Poisson’s equation—or rather, it is three Poisson’s equa- tions, one for each Cartesian 19 component. Assuming J goes to zero at inﬁnity, we can read off the solution: A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′) r dτ ′. (5.65) 19In Cartesian coordinates, ∇2A = (∇2 Ax )ˆx + (∇2 Ay )ˆy + (∇2 Az)ˆz, so Eq. 5.64 reduces to ∇2 Ax = −μ0 Jx , ∇2 Ay =−μ0 Jy ,and ∇2 Az =−μ0 Jz. In curvilinear coordinates the unit vectors them- selves are functions of position, and must be differentiated, so it is not the case, for example, that ∇2 Ar =−μ0 Jr . Remember that even if you plan to evaluate integrals such as 5.65 using curvilinear coordinates, you must ﬁrst express J in terms of its Cartesian components (see Sect. 1.4.1). 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 245 For line and surface currents, A = μ0 4π ∫ I r dl ′ = μ0 I 4π ∫ 1 r dl′; A = μ0 4π ∫ K r da′. (5.66) (If the current does not go to zero at inﬁnity, we have to ﬁnd other ways to get A; some of these are explored in Ex. 5.12 and in the problems at the end of the section.) It must be said that A is not as useful as V . For one thing, it’s still a vector, and although Eqs. 5.65 and 5.66 are somewhat easier to work with than the Biot- Savart law, you still have to fuss with components. It would be nice if we could get away with a scalar potential B =−∇U, (5.67) but this is incompatible with Ampère’s law, since the curl of a gradient is always zero. (A magnetostatic scalar potential can be used, if you stick scrupulously to simply-connected, current-free regions, but as a theoretical tool, it is of limited interest. See Prob. 5.29.) Moreover, since magnetic forces do no work, A does not admit a simple physical interpretation in terms of potential energy per unit charge. (In some contexts it can be interpreted as momentum per unit charge. 20) Nevertheless, the vector potential has substantial theoretical importance, as we shall see in Chapter 10. Example 5.11. A spherical shell of radius R, carrying a uniform surface charge σ , is set spinning at angular velocity ωωω. Find the vector potential it produces at point r (Fig. 5.45). Solution It might seem natural to set the polar axis along ωωω, but in fact the integration is easier if we let r lie on the z axis, so that ωωω is tilted at an angle ψ.Wemay as well orient the x axis so that ωωω lies in the xz plane, as shown in Fig. 5.46. According to Eq. 5.66, R ψ ω r FIGURE 5.45 r′ r r θ′ψ ω x y z da′ φ′ FIGURE 5.46 20M. D. Semon and J. R. Taylor, Am. J. Phys. 64, 1361 (1996). 246 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ K(r ′) r da′, where K = σ v, r = √R2 + r 2 − 2Rr cos θ ′, and da′ = R2 sin θ ′ dθ ′ dφ′.Now the velocity of a point r ′ in a rotating rigid body is given by ωωω × r ′; in this case, v = ωωω × r ′ = √ √ √ √ √ √ ˆx ˆy ˆz ω sin ψ 0 ω cos ψ R sin θ ′ cos φ′ R sin θ ′ sin φ′ R cos θ ′ √ √ √ √ √ √ = Rω [ − (cos ψ sin θ ′ sin φ′) ˆx+(cos ψ sin θ ′ cos φ′ − sin ψ cos θ ′) ˆy + (sin ψ sin θ ′ sin φ′) ˆz] . Notice that each of these terms, save one, involves either sin φ′ or cos φ′. Since ∫ 2π 0 sin φ′ dφ′ = ∫ 2π 0 cos φ′ dφ′ = 0, such terms contribute nothing. There remains A(r) =− μ0 R3σω sin ψ 2 (∫ π 0 cos θ ′ sin θ ′ √R2 + r 2 − 2Rr cos θ ′ dθ ′) ˆy. Letting u ≡ cos θ ′, the integral becomes ∫ +1 −1 u √R2 + r 2 − 2Rr u du =− (R2 + r 2 + Rr u) 3R2r 2 √R2 + r 2 − 2Rr u √ √ √ √ +1 −1 =− 1 3R2r 2 [ (R2 + r 2 + Rr )|R − r | −(R2 + r 2 − Rr )(R + r ) ] . If the point r lies inside the sphere, then R > r , and this expression reduces to (2r/3R2);if r lies outside the sphere, so that R < r , it reduces to (2R/3r 2).Not- ing that (ωωω × r) =−ωr sin ψ ˆy, we have, ﬁnally, A(r) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ μ0 Rσ 3 (ωωω × r), for points inside the sphere, μ0 R4σ 3r 3 (ωωω × r), for points outside the sphere. (5.68) Having evaluated the integral, I revert to the “natural” coordinates of Fig. 5.45, in which ωωω coincides with the z axis and the point r is at (r,θ,φ): A(r,θ,φ) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ μ0 Rωσ 3 r sin θ ˆφ,(r ≤ R), μ0 R4ωσ 3 sin θ r 2 ˆφ,(r ≥ R). (5.69) 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 247 Curiously, the ﬁeld inside this spherical shell is uniform: B = ∇ × A = 2μ0 Rωσ 3 (cos θ ˆr − sin θ ˆθ ) = 2 3 μ0σ Rω ˆz = 2 3 μ0σ Rωωω. (5.70) Example 5.12. Find the vector potential of an inﬁnite solenoid with n turns per unit length, radius R, and current I . Solution This time we cannot use Eq. 5.66, since the current itself extends to inﬁnity. But here’s a cute method that does the job. Notice that ∮ A · dl = ∫ (∇ × A) · da = ∫ B · da = \u0010, (5.71) where \u0010 is the ﬂux of B through the loop in question. This is reminiscent of Ampère’s law in integral form (Eq. 5.57), ∮ B · dl = μ0 Ienc. In fact, it’s the same equation, with B → A and μ0 Ienc → \u0010. If symmetry per- mits, we can determine A from \u0010 in the same way we got B from Ienc,in Sect. 5.3.3. The present problem (with a uniform longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld μ0nI inside the solenoid and no ﬁeld outside) is analogous to the Ampère’s law problem of a fat wire carrying a uniformly distributed current. The vector potential is “circumferential” (it mimics the magnetic ﬁeld in the analog); using a circular “Amperian loop” at radius sinside the solenoid, we have ∮ A · dl = A(2π s) = ∫ B · da = μ0nI (πs2), so A = μ0nI 2 s ˆφ, for s ≤ R. (5.72) For an Amperian loop outside the solenoid, the ﬂux is ∫ B · da = μ0nI (π R2), since the ﬁeld only extends out to R. Thus A = μ0nI 2 R2 s ˆφ, for s ≥ R. (5.73) If you have any doubts about this answer, check it: Does ∇ × A = B? Does ∇ · A = 0? If so, we’re done. 248 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics Typically, the direction of A mimics the direction of the current. For instance, both were azimuthal in Exs. 5.11 and 5.12. Indeed, if all the current ﬂows in one direction, then Eq. 5.65 suggests that A must point that way too. Thus the potential of a ﬁnite segment of straight wire (Prob. 5.23) is in the direction of the current. Of course, if the current extends to inﬁnity you can’t use Eq. 5.65 in the ﬁrst place (see Probs. 5.26 and 5.27). Moreover, you can always add an arbitrary constant vector to A—this is analogous to changing the reference point for V , and it won’t affect the divergence or curl of A, which is all that matters (in Eq. 5.65 we have chosen the constant so that A goes to zero at inﬁnity). In principle you could even use a vector potential that is not divergenceless, in which case all bets are off. Despite these caveats, the essential point remains: Ordinarily the direction of A will match the direction of the current. Problem 5.23 Find the magnetic vector potential of a ﬁnite segment of straight wire carrying a current I . [Put the wire on the z axis, from z1 to z2, and use Eq. 5.66.] Check that your answer is consistent with Eq. 5.37. Problem 5.24 What current density would produce the vector potential, A = k ˆφ (where k is a constant), in cylindrical coordinates? Problem 5.25 If B is uniform, show that A(r) =− 1 2 (r × B) works. That is, check that ∇ · A = 0and ∇ × A = B. Is this result unique, or are there other functions with the same divergence and curl? Problem 5.26 (a) By whatever means you can think of (short of looking it up), ﬁnd the vector potential a distance s from an inﬁnite straight wire carrying a current I .Check that ∇ · A = 0and ∇ × A = B. (b) Find the magnetic potential inside the wire, if it has radius R and the current is uniformly distributed. Problem 5.27 Find the vector potential above and below the plane surface current in Ex. 5.8. Problem 5.28 (a) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.63, by applying the divergence. (b) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.47, by applying the curl. (c) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.64, by applying the Laplacian. Problem 5.29 Suppose you want to deﬁne a magnetic scalar potential U (Eq. 5.67) in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire. First of all, you must stay away from the wire itself (there ∇ × B ̸= 0); but that’s not enough. Show, by applying Ampère’s law to a path that starts at a and circles the wire, returning to b (Fig. 5.47), that the scalar potential cannot be single-valued (that is, U (a) ̸= U (b),eveniftheyrepre- sent the same physical point). As an example, ﬁnd the scalar potential for an inﬁnite 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 249 I Amperian loop a b FIGURE 5.47 straight wire. (To avoid a multivalued potential, you must restrict yourself to simply- connected regions that remain on one side or the other of every wire, never allowing you to go all the way around.) Problem 5.30 Use the results of Ex. 5.11 to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld inside a solid sphere, of uniform charge density ρ and radius R, that is rotating at a constant angular velocity ωωω. Problem 5.31 (a) Complete the proof of Theorem 2, Sect. 1.6.2. That is, show that any diver- genceless vector ﬁeld F can be written as the curl of a vector potential A.What you have to do is ﬁnd Ax , Ay,and Az such that (i) ∂ Az/∂ y − ∂ Ay/∂z = Fx ; (ii) ∂ Ax /∂z − ∂ Az/∂ x = Fy; and (iii) ∂ Ay/∂ x − ∂ Ax /∂ y = Fz. Here’s one waytodoit: Pick Ax = 0, and solve (ii) and (iii) for Ay and Az. Note that the “constants of integration” are themselves functions of y and z—they’re constant only with respect to x. Now plug these expressions into (i), and use the fact that ∇ · F = 0 to obtain Ay = ∫ x 0 Fz(x ′, y, z) dx ′; Az = ∫ y 0 Fx (0, y′, z) dy′ − ∫ x 0 Fy(x ′, y, z) dx ′. (b) By direct differentiation, check that the A you obtained in part (a) satisﬁes ∇ × A = F.Is A divergenceless? [This was a very asymmetrical construc- tion, and it would be surprising if it were—although we know that there exists a vector whose curl is F and whose divergence is zero.] (c) As an example, let F = y ˆx + z ˆy + x ˆz. Calculate A, and conﬁrm that ∇ × A = F. (For further discussion, see Prob. 5.53.) 5.4.2 Boundary Conditions In Chapter 2, I drew a triangular diagram to summarize the relations among the three fundamental quantities of electrostatics: the charge density ρ, the electric ﬁeld E, and the potential V . A similar ﬁgure can be constructed for magnetostatics (Fig. 5.48), relating the current density J, the ﬁeld B, and the potential A. There is one “missing link” in the diagram: the equation for A in terms of B. It’s unlikely you would ever need such a formula, but in case you are interested, see Probs. 5.52 and 5.53. 250 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics J BAB =dτμ04πr2J r B = μ0J; B = 0A =dτμ04πrJ2A = −μ0J B = A; A = 0 ΔΔΔ ΔΔ ×××. . FIGURE 5.48 Just as the electric ﬁeld suffers a discontinuity at a surface charge, so the mag- netic ﬁeld is discontinuous at a surface current. Only this time it is the tangential component that changes. For if we apply Eq. 5.50, in integral form, ∮ B · da = 0, to a wafer-thin pillbox straddling the surface (Fig. 5.49), we get B⊥ above = B⊥ below. (5.74) As for the tangential components, an Amperian loop running perpendicular to the current (Fig. 5.50) yields ∮ B · dl = (B⃝ above − B⃝ below) l = μ0 Ienc = μ0 Kl, or B⃝ above − B⃝ below = μ0 K . (5.75) B⊥ above B ⊥ below K FIGURE 5.49 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 251 B\u0002 above B\u0002 below K l FIGURE 5.50 Thus the component of B that is parallel to the surface but perpendicular to the current is discontinuous in the amount μ0 K . A similar Amperian loop running parallel to the current reveals that the parallel component is continuous. These results can be summarized in a single formula: Babove − Bbelow = μ0(K × ˆn), (5.76) where ˆn is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing “upward.” Like the scalar potential in electrostatics, the vector potential is continuous across any boundary: Aabove = Abelow, (5.77) for ∇ · A = 0 guarantees21 that the normal component is continuous; and ∇ × A = B,inthe form∮ A · dl = ∫ B · da = \u0010, means that the tangential components are continuous (the ﬂux through an Am- perian loop of vanishing thickness is zero). But the derivative of A inherits the discontinuity of B: ∂Aabove ∂n − ∂Abelow ∂n =−μ0K. (5.78) Problem 5.32 (a) Check Eq. 5.76 for the conﬁguration in Ex. 5.9. (b) Check Eqs. 5.77 and 5.78 for the conﬁguration in Ex. 5.11. Problem 5.33 Prove Eq. 5.78, using Eqs. 5.63, 5.76, and 5.77. [Suggestion: I’d set up Cartesian coordinates at the surface, with z perpendicular to the surface and x parallel to the current.] 21Note that Eqs. 5.77 and 5.78 presuppose that A is divergenceless. 252 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics 5.4.3 Multipole Expansion of the Vector Potential If you want an approximate formula for the vector potential of a localized current distribution, valid at distant points, a multipole expansion is in order. Remember: the idea of a multipole expansion is to write the potential in the form of a power series in 1/r , where r is the distance to the point in question (Fig. 5.51); if r is sufﬁciently large, the series will be dominated by the lowest nonvanishing contri- bution, and the higher terms can be ignored. As we found in Sect. 3.4.1 (Eq. 3.94), 1 r = 1 √ r 2 + (r ′)2 − 2rr ′ cos α = 1 r ∞∑ n=0 (r ′ r )n Pn(cos α), (5.79) where α is the angle between r and r ′. Accordingly, the vector potential of a current loop can be written A(r) = μ0 I 4π ∮ 1 r dl′ = μ0 I 4π ∞∑ n=0 1 r n+1 ∮ (r ′)n Pn(cos α) dl′, (5.80) or, more explicitly: A(r) = μ0 I 4π [ 1 r ∮ dl′ + 1 r 2 ∮ r ′ cos α dl′ + 1 r 3 ∮ (r ′)2 ( 3 2 cos2 α − 1 2 ) dl′ + ··· ] . (5.81) As in the multipole expansion of V , we call the ﬁrst term (which goes like 1/r )the monopole term, the second (which goes like 1/r 2) dipole, the third quadrupole, and so on. dr′ = dl′ I r α r r′ O FIGURE 5.51 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 253 Now, the magnetic monopole term is always zero, for the integral is just the total vector displacement around a closed loop: ∮ dl′ = 0. (5.82) This reﬂects the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles in nature (an assump- tion contained in Maxwell’s equation ∇ · B = 0, on which the entire theory of vector potential is predicated). In the absence of any monopole contribution, the dominant term is the dipole (except in the rare case where it, too, vanishes): Adip(r) = μ0 I 4πr 2 ∮ r ′ cos α dl′ = μ0 I 4πr 2 ∮ (ˆr · r ′) dl′. (5.83) This integral can be rewritten in a more illuminating way if we invoke Eq. 1.108, with c = ˆr: ∮ (ˆr · r ′) dl′ =−ˆr × ∫ da ′. (5.84) Then Adip(r) = μ0 4π m × ˆr r 2 , (5.85) where m is the magnetic dipole moment: m ≡ I ∫ da = I a. (5.86) Here a is the “vector area” of the loop (Prob. 1.62); if the loop is ﬂat, a is the ordinary area enclosed, with the direction assigned by the usual right-hand rule (ﬁngers in the direction of the current). Example 5.13. Find the magnetic dipole moment of the “bookend-shaped” loop shown in Fig. 5.52. All sides have length w, and it carries a current I . I z y x w w w FIGURE 5.52 254 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics Solution This wire could be considered the superposition of two plane square loops (Fig. 5.53). The “extra” sides ( AB) cancel when the two are put together, since the currents ﬂow in opposite directions. The net magnetic dipole moment is m = I w2 ˆy + I w2 ˆz; its magnitude is √ 2I w2, and it points along the 45 ◦ line z = y. w w w w A A I I + B B FIGURE 5.53 It is clear from Eq. 5.86 that the magnetic dipole moment is independent of the choice of origin. You may remember that the electric dipole moment is in- dependent of the origin only when the total charge vanishes (Sect. 3.4.3). Since the magnetic monopole moment is always zero, it is not really surprising that the magnetic dipole moment is always independent of origin. Although the dipole term dominates the multipole expansion (unless m = 0) and thus offers a good approximation to the true potential, it is not ordinarily the exact potential; there will be quadrupole, octopole, and higher contributions. You might ask, is it possible to devise a current distribution whose potential is “pure” dipole—for which Eq. 5.85 is exact? Well, yes and no: like the electrical analog, it can be done, but the model is a bit contrived. To begin with, you must take an inﬁnitesimally small loop at the origin, but then, in order to keep the dipole mo- ment ﬁnite, you have to crank the current up to inﬁnity, with the product m = Ia held ﬁxed. In practice, the dipole potential is a suitable approximation whenever the distance r greatly exceeds the size of the loop. The magnetic ﬁeld of a (perfect) dipole is easiest to calculate if we put m at the origin and let it point in the z-direction (Fig. 5.54). According to Eq. 5.85, the potential at point (r,θ,φ) is r m θ x y z φ FIGURE 5.54 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 255 y z y z (a) Field of a \"pure\" dipole (b) Field of a \"physical\" dipole FIGURE 5.55 Adip(r) = μ0 4π m sin θ r 2 ˆφ, (5.87) and hence Bdip(r) = ∇ × A = μ0m 4πr 3 (2 cos θ ˆr + sin θ ˆθ ). (5.88) Surprisingly, this is identical in structure to the ﬁeld of an electric dipole (Eq. 3.103)! (Up close, however, the ﬁeld of a physical magnetic dipole—a small current loop—looks quite different from the ﬁeld of a physical electric dipole—plus and minus charges a short distance apart. Compare Fig. 5.55 with Fig. 3.37.) Problem 5.34 Show that the magnetic ﬁeld of a dipole can be written in coordinate-• free form: Bdip(r) = μ0 4π 1 r 3 [3(m · ˆr)ˆr − m]. (5.89) Problem 5.35 A circular loop of wire, with radius R, lies in the xy plane (centered at the origin) and carries a current I running counterclockwise as viewed from the positive z axis. (a) What is its magnetic dipole moment? (b) What is the (approximate) magnetic ﬁeld at points far from the origin? (c) Show that, for points on the z axis, your answer is consistent with the exact ﬁeld (Ex. 5.6), when z ≫ R. Problem 5.36 Find the exact magnetic ﬁeld a distance z above the center of a square loop of side w, carrying a current I . Verify that it reduces to the ﬁeld of a dipole, with the appropriate dipole moment, when z ≫ w. 256 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics Problem 5.37 (a) A phonograph record of radius R, carrying a uniform surface charge σ ,isrotat- ing at constant angular velocity ω. Find its magnetic dipole moment. (b) Find the magnetic dipole moment of the spinning spherical shell in Ex. 5.11. Show that for points r > R the potential is that of a perfect dipole. Problem 5.38 I worked out the multipole expansion for the vector potential of a line current because that’s the most common type, and in some respects the easiest to handle. For a volume current J: (a) Write down the multipole expansion, analogous to Eq. 5.80. (b) Write down the monopole potential, and prove that it vanishes. (c) Using Eqs. 1.107 and 5.86, show that the dipole moment can be written m = 1 2 ∫ (r × J) dτ.

Describe the motion. Problem 5.40 It may have occurred to you that since parallel currents attract, the current within a single wire should contract into a tiny concentrated stream along the axis. Yet in practice the current typically distributes itself quite uniformly over the wire. How do you account for this? If the positive charges (density ρ+)are “nailed down,” and the negative charges (density ρ−) move at speed v (and none of these depends on the distance from the axis), show that ρ− =−ρ+γ 2,where γ ≡ 1/ √1 − (v/c)2 and c2 = 1/μ0ϵ0. If the wire as a whole is neutral, where is the compensating charge located?22 [Notice that for typical velocities (see Prob. 5.20), the two charge densities are essentially unchanged by the current (since γ ≈ 1). In plasmas, however, where the positive charges are also free to move, this so-called pinch effect can be very signiﬁcant.] Problem 5.41 A current I ﬂows to the right through a rectangular bar of conducting material, in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B pointing out of the page (Fig. 5.56). (a) If the moving charges are positive, in which direction are they deﬂected by the magnetic ﬁeld? This deﬂection results in an accumulation of charge on the 22For further discussion, see D. C.

(b) Find the resulting potential difference (the Hall voltage) between the top and bottom of the bar, in terms of B, v (the speed of the charges), and the relevant dimensions of the bar.23 (c) How would your analysis change if the moving charges were negative?[The Hall effect is the classic way of determining the sign of the mobile charge carriers in a material.] B II l t w FIGURE 5.56 w I FIGURE 5.57 Problem 5.42 A plane wire loop of irregular shape is situated so that part of it is in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B (in Fig. 5.57 the ﬁeld occupies the shaded region, and points perpendicular to the plane of the loop).

Olbert, Introduction to the Physics of Space (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1970). 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 259 Problem 5.46 Use the Biot-Savart law (most conveniently in the form of Eq. 5.42! appropriate to surface currents) to ﬁnd the ﬁeld inside and outside an inﬁnitely long solenoid of radius R, with n turns per unit length, carrying a steady current I . R I R I dz = 0 z FIGURE 5.59 Problem 5.47 The magnetic ﬁeld on the axis of a circular current loop (Eq. 5.41) is far from uniform (it falls off sharply with increasing z). You can produce a more nearly uniform ﬁeld by using two such loops a distance d apart (Fig. 5.59). (a) Find the ﬁeld (B) as a function of z,and show that ∂ B/∂z is zero at the point midway between them (z = 0). (b) If you pick d just right, the second derivative of B will also vanish at the mid- point. This arrangement is known as a Helmholtz coil; it’s a convenient way of producing relatively uniform ﬁelds in the laboratory. Determine d such that ∂ 2 B/∂z2 = 0 at the midpoint, and ﬁnd the resulting magnetic ﬁeld at the center. [Answer: 8μ0 I /5 √5R] Problem 5.48 Use Eq. 5.41 to obtain the magnetic ﬁeld on the axis of the rotating disk in Prob. 5.37(a). Show that the dipole ﬁeld (Eq. 5.88), with the dipole moment you found in Prob. 5.37, is a good approximation if z ≫ R. Problem 5.49 Suppose you wanted to ﬁnd the ﬁeld of a circular loop (Ex. 5.6) at a point r that is not directly above the center (Fig. 5.60). You might as well choose your axes so that r lies in the yz plane at (0, y, z). The source point is (R cos φ′, R sin φ′,0), and φ′ runs from 0 to 2π . Set up the integrals25 from which you could calculate Bx , By,and Bz, and evaluate Bx explicitly. Problem 5.50 Magnetostatics treats the “source current” (the one that sets up the ﬁeld) and the “recipient current” (the one that experiences the force) so asymmet- rically that it is by no means obvious that the magnetic force between two current loops is consistent with Newton’s third law. Show, starting with the Biot-Savart law (Eq. 5.34) and the Lorentz force law (Eq. 5.16), that the force on loop 2 due to loop 1 (Fig. 5.61) can be written as F2 =− μ0 4π I1 I2 ∮∮ ˆr r2 dl1 · dl2.

Problem 5.51 Consider a plane loop of wire that carries a steady current I ;we want to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld at a point in the plane. We might as well take that point to be the origin (it could be inside or outside the loop).

Miranda, Am.J.Phys. 68, 254 (2000). 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 261 (d) For a conic section with focus at the origin, r (θ) = p 1 + e cos θ , where p is the semilatus rectum (the y intercept) and e is the eccentricity (e = 0 for a circle, 0 < e < 1 for an ellipse, e = 1 for a parabola). Show that the ﬁeld is B = μ0 I 2 p regardless of the eccentricity. 27 Problem 5.52 (a) One way to ﬁll in the “missing link” in Fig. 5.48 is to exploit the analogy be- tween the deﬁning equations for A (viz. ∇ · A = 0, ∇ × A = B) and Maxwell’s equations for B (viz. ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × B = μ0J). Evidently A depends on B in exactly the same way that B depends on μ0J (to wit: the Biot-Savart law). Use this observation to write down the formula for A in terms of B. (b) The electrical analog to your result in (a) is V (r) =− 1 4π ∫ E(r ′) · ˆr r2 dτ ′. Derive it, by exploiting the appropriate analogy. Problem 5.53 Another way to ﬁll in the “missing link” in Fig. 5.48 is to look for a! magnetostatic analog to Eq. 2.21. The obvious candidate would be A(r) = ∫ r O (B × dl). (a) Test this formula for the simplest possible case—uniform B (use the origin as your reference point). Is the result consistent with Prob. 5.25? You could cure this problem by throwing in a factor of 1 2 , but the ﬂaw in this equation runs deeper.

Dirac’s relativistic electron theory got the 2 right, and Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga later calculated tiny further correc- tions. The determination of the electron’s magnetic dipole moment remains the ﬁnest achievement of quantum electrodynamics, and exhibits perhaps the most stunningly precise agreement between theory and experiment in all of physics.

Yet all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion, and in fact, if you could examine a piece of magnetic material on an atomic scale you would ﬁnd tiny currents: electrons orbiting around nuclei and spinning about their axes. For macroscopic purposes, these current loops are so small that we may treat them as magnetic dipoles. Ordinarily, they cancel each other out because of the random orientation of the atoms. But when a magnetic ﬁeld is applied, a net alignment of these magnetic dipoles occurs, and the medium becomes magnetically polarized, or magnetized. Unlike electric polarization, which is almost always in the same direction as E, some materials acquire a magnetization parallel to B (paramagnets) and some opposite to B (diamagnets). A few substances (called ferromagnets, in defer- ence to the most common example, iron) retain their magnetization even after the external ﬁeld has been removed—for these, the magnetization is not determined by the present ﬁeld but by the whole magnetic “history” of the object. Permanent magnets made of iron are the most familiar examples of magnetism, but from a theoretical point of view they are the most complicated; I’ll save ferromagnetism for the end of the chapter, and begin with qualitative models of paramagnetism and diamagnetism. 6.1.2 Torques and Forces on Magnetic Dipoles A magnetic dipole experiences a torque in a magnetic ﬁeld, just as an electric dipole does in an electric ﬁeld. Let’s calculate the torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform ﬁeld B. (Since any current loop could be built up from inﬁnites- imal rectangles, with all the “internal” sides canceling, as indicated in Fig. 6.1, there is no real loss of generality here; but if you prefer to start from scratch with an arbitrary shape, see Prob. 6.2.) Center the loop at the origin, and tilt it an angle θ from the z axis towards the y axis (Fig. 6.2). Let B point in the z direction. The forces on the two sloping sides cancel (they tend to stretch the loop, but they don’t 266 6.1 Magnetization 267 I FIGURE 6.1 rotate it). The forces on the “horizontal” sides are likewise equal and opposite (so the net force on the loop is zero), but they do generate a torque: N = aF sin θ ˆx. The magnitude of the force on each of these segments is F = IbB, and therefore N = IabB sin θ ˆx = mB sin θ ˆx, or N = m × B, (6.1) where m = Iab is the magnetic dipole moment of the loop. Equation 6.1 gives the torque on any localized current distribution, in the presence of a uniform ﬁeld; in a nonuniform ﬁeld it is the exact torque (about the center) for a perfect dipole of inﬁnitesimal size. x I y z m (a) ba θ θ y z m F F (b) a θ θ B B FIGURE 6.2 268 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter Notice that Eq. 6.1 is identical in form to the electrical analog, Eq. 4.4: N = p × E. In particular, the torque is again in such a direction as to line the dipole up parallel to the ﬁeld. It is this torque that accounts for paramagnetism. Since every electron constitutes a magnetic dipole (picture it, if you wish, as a tiny spinning sphere of charge), you might expect paramagnetism to be a univer- sal phenomenon. Actually, quantum mechanics (speciﬁcally, the Pauli exclusion principle) tends to lock the electrons within a given atom together in pairs with opposing spins, 1 and this effectively neutralizes the torque on the combination. As a result, paramagnetism most often occurs in atoms or molecules with an odd number of electrons, where the “extra” unpaired member is subject to the magnetic torque. Even here, the alignment is far from complete, since random thermal collisions tend to destroy the order. In a uniform ﬁeld, the net force on a current loop is zero: F = I √ (dl × B) = I (√ dl) × B = 0; the constant B comes outside the integral, and the net displacement ∮ dl around a closed loop vanishes. In a nonuniform ﬁeld this is no longer the case. For example, suppose a circular wire ring of radius R, carrying a current I , is suspended above a short solenoid in the “fringing” region (Fig. 6.3). Here B has a radial component, and there is a net downward force on the loop (Fig. 6.4): F = 2π IR B cos θ. (6.2) For an inﬁnitesimal loop, with dipole moment m, in a ﬁeld B, the force is F = ∇(m · B) (6.3) II B FIGURE 6.3 B F B F I R θ FIGURE 6.4 1This is not always true for the outermost electrons in unﬁlled shells. 6.1 Magnetization 269 (see Prob. 6.4). Once again the magnetic formula is identical to its electrical “twin,” if we write the latter in the form F = ∇(p · E). (See footnote to Eq. 4.5.) If you’re starting to get a sense of déjà vu, perhaps you will have more respect for those early physicists who thought magnetic dipoles consisted of positive and negative magnetic “charges” (north and south “poles,” they called them), sepa- rated by a small distance, just like electric dipoles (Fig. 6.5(a)). They wrote down a “Coulomb’s law” for the attraction and repulsion of these poles, and devel- oped the whole of magnetostatics in exact analogy to electrostatics. It’s not a bad model, for many purposes—it gives the correct ﬁeld of a dipole (at least, away from the origin), the right torque on a dipole (at least, on a stationary dipole), and the proper force on a dipole (at least, in the absence of external currents). But it’s bad physics, because there’s no such thing as a single magnetic north pole or south pole. If you break a bar magnet in half, you don’t get a north pole in one hand and a south pole in the other; you get two complete magnets. Magnetism is not due to magnetic monopoles, but rather to moving electric charges; mag- netic dipoles are tiny current loops (Fig. 6.5(c)), and it’s an extraordinary thing, really, that the formulas involving m bear any resemblance to the corresponding formulas for p. Sometimes it is easier to think in terms of the “Gilbert” model of a magnetic dipole (separated monopoles), instead of the physically correct “Am- père” model (current loop). Indeed, this picture occasionally offers a quick and clever solution to an otherwise cumbersome problem (you just copy the corre- sponding result from electrostatics, changing p to m,1/ϵ0 to μ0, and E to B). But whenever the close-up features of the dipole come into play, the two models can yield strikingly different answers. My advice is to use the Gilbert model, if you like, to get an intuitive “feel” for a problem, but never rely on it for quantitative results. m N S (a) Magnetic dipole (Gilbert model) p + − (b) Electric dipole m I (c) Magnetic dipole (Ampère model) FIGURE 6.5 Problem 6.1 Calculate the torque exerted on the square loop shown in Fig. 6.6, due to the circular loop (assume r is much larger than a or b).

(c) In the electrostatic case, the expressions F = ∇(p · E) and F = (p · ∇)E are equivalent (prove it), but this is not the case for the magnetic analogs (explain why). As an example, calculate (m · ∇)B for the conﬁgurations in (a) and (b). 6.1 Magnetization 271 6.1.3 Effect of a Magnetic Field on Atomic Orbits Electrons not only spin;theyalso revolve around the nucleus—for simplicity, let’s assume the orbit is a circle of radius R (Fig. 6.9). Although technically this orbital motion does not constitute a steady current, in practice the period T = 2π R/v is so short that unless you blink awfully fast, it’s going to look like a steady current: I = −e T =− ev 2π R . (The minus sign accounts for the negative charge of the electron.) Accordingly, the orbital dipole moment (I π R2)is m =− 1 2 ev R ˆz. (6.4) Like any other magnetic dipole, this one is subject to a torque (m × B) when you turn on a magnetic ﬁeld. But it’s a lot harder to tilt the entire orbit than it is the spin, so the orbital contribution to paramagnetism is small. There is, however, a more signiﬁcant effect on the orbital motion: The electron speeds up or slows down, depending on the orientation of B. For whereas the centripetal acceleration v2/R is ordinarily sustained by electrical forces alone, 2 1 4πϵ0 e2 R2 = me v2 R , (6.5) in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld there is an additional force, −e(v × B).For the sake of argument, let’s say that B is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, as shown in Fig. 6.10; then 1 4πϵ0 e2 R2 + e ¯v B = me ¯v2 R . (6.6) Under these conditions, the new speed ¯v is greater than v: e ¯v B = me R ( ¯v2 − v2) = me R ( ¯v + v)( ¯v − v), v z m R −e FIGURE 6.9 2To avoid confusion with the magnetic dipole moment m, I’ll write the electron mass with subscript: me. 272 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter v B BB R −e +e FIGURE 6.10 or, assuming the change <v =¯v − v is small, <v = eR B 2me . (6.7) When B is turned on, then, the electron speeds up. 3 A change in orbital speed means a change in the dipole moment (Eq. 6.4): <m =− 1 2 e(<v)R ˆz =− e2 R2 4me B. (6.8) Notice that the change in m is opposite to the direction of B. (An electron circling the other way would have a dipole moment pointing upward, but such an orbit would be slowed down by the ﬁeld, so the change is still opposite to B.) Ordi- narily, the electron orbits are randomly oriented, and the orbital dipole moments cancel out. But in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, each atom picks up a little “extra” dipole moment, and these increments are all antiparallel to the ﬁeld. This is the mechanism responsible for diamagnetism. It is a universal phenomenon, affecting all atoms. However, it is typically much weaker than paramagnetism, and is therefore observed mainly in atoms with even numbers of electrons, where paramagnetism is usually absent. In deriving Eq. 6.8, I assumed that the orbit remains circular, with its original radius R. I cannot offer a justiﬁcation for this at the present stage. If the atom is stationary while the ﬁeld is turned on, then my assumption can be proved— this is not magnetostatics, however, and the details will have to await Chapter 7 (see Prob. 7.52). If the atom is moved into the ﬁeld, the situation is enormously more complicated. But never mind—I’m only trying to give you a qualitative account of diamagnetism. Assume, if you prefer, that the velocity remains the same while the radius changes—the formula (Eq. 6.8) is altered (by a factor of 2), but the qualitative conclusion is unaffected. The truth is that this classical model is fundamentally ﬂawed (diamagnetism is really a quantum phenomenon), so there’s 3I said (Eq. 5.11) that magnetic ﬁelds do no work, and are incapable of speeding a particle up. I stand by that. However, as we shall see in Chapter 7, a changing magnetic ﬁeld induces an electric ﬁeld, and it is the latter that accelerates the electrons in this instance. 6.1 Magnetization 273 not much point in reﬁning the details.4 What is important is the empirical fact that in diamagnetic materials the induced dipole moments point opposite to the magnetic ﬁeld. 6.1.4 Magnetization In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, matter becomes magnetized; that is, upon microscopic examination, it will be found to contain many tiny dipoles, with a net alignment along some direction. We have discussed two mechanisms that account for this magnetic polarization: (1) paramagnetism (the dipoles associated with the spins of unpaired electrons experience a torque tending to line them up parallel to the ﬁeld) and (2) diamagnetism (the orbital speed of the electrons is altered in such a way as to change the orbital dipole moment in a direction opposite to the ﬁeld). Whatever the cause, we describe the state of magnetic polarization by the vector quantity M ≡ magnetic di pole moment per unit volume. (6.9) M is called the magnetization; it plays a role analogous to the polarization P in electrostatics. In the following section, we will not worry about how the magnetization got there—it could be paramagnetism, diamagnetism, or even ferromagnetism—we shall take M as given, and calculate the ﬁeld this magneti- zation itself produces. Incidentally, it may have surprised you to learn that materials other than the famous ferromagnetic trio (iron, nickel, and cobalt) are affected by a magnetic ﬁeld at all. You cannot, of course, pick up a piece of wood or aluminum with a magnet. The reason is that diamagnetism and paramagnetism are extremely weak: It takes a delicate experiment and a powerful magnet to detect them at all. If you were to suspend a piece of paramagnetic material above a solenoid, as in Fig. 6.3, the induced magnetization would be upward, and hence the force downward. By contrast, the magnetization of a diamagnetic object would be downward and the force upward. In general, when a sample is placed in a region of nonuniform ﬁeld, the paramagnet is attracted into the ﬁeld, whereas the diamagnet is repelled away. But the actual forces are pitifully weak—in a typical experimental arrangement the force on a comparable sample of iron would be 104 or 10 5 times as great. That’s why it was reasonable for us to calculate the ﬁeld inside a piece of copper wire, say, in Chapter 5, without worrying about the effects of magnetization.5 4S. L. O’Dell and R. K. P. Zia, Am.

(Actually, copper is slightly diamagnetic; otherwise they’re all what you’d expect.) 6.2 THE FIELD OF A MAGNETIZED OBJECT 6.2.1 Bound Currents Suppose we have a piece of magnetized material; the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume, M, is given. What ﬁeld does this object produce? Well, the vector potential of a single dipole m is given by Eq. 5.85: A(r) = μ0 4π m × ˆr r2 . (6.10) In the magnetized object, each volume element dτ ; carries a dipole moment M dτ ;, so the total vector potential is (Fig. 6.11) A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ M(r ;) × ˆr r2 dτ ;. (6.11) That does it, in principle. But, as in the electrical case (Sect. 4.2.1), the integral can be cast in a more illuminating form by exploiting the identity ∇; 1 r = ˆr r2 . With this, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ [ M(r ;) × ( ∇; 1 r )] dτ ;. Integrating by parts, using product rule 7, gives A(r) = μ0 4π {∫ 1 r [∇; × M(r ;)] dτ ; − ∫ ∇; × [ M(r ;) r ] dτ ;} . m r dτ′ FIGURE 6.11 6.2 The Field of a Magnetized Object 275 Problem 1.61(b) invites us to express the latter as a surface integral, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ 1 r [∇; × M(r ;)] dτ ; + μ0 4π √ 1 r [M(r ;) × da ;]. (6.12) The ﬁrst term looks just like the potential of a volume current, Jb = ∇ × M, (6.13) while the second looks like the potential of a surface current, Kb = M × ˆn, (6.14) where ˆn is the normal unit vector. With these deﬁnitions, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ V Jb(r ;) r dτ ; + μ0 4π √ S Kb(r ;) r da;. (6.15) What this means is that the potential (and hence also the ﬁeld) of a magnetized object is the same as would be produced by a volume current Jb = ∇ × M throughout the material, plus a surface current Kb = M × ˆn, on the boundary. Instead of integrating the contributions of all the inﬁnitesimal dipoles, using Eq. 6.11, we ﬁrst determine the bound currents, and then ﬁnd the ﬁeld they produce, in the same way we would calculate the ﬁeld of any other volume and surface currents. Notice the striking parallel with the electrical case: there the ﬁeld of a polarized object was the same as that of a bound volume charge ρb =−∇ · P plus a bound surface charge σb = P · ˆn. Example 6.1. Find the magnetic ﬁeld of a uniformly magnetized sphere. Solution Choosing the z axis along the direction of M (Fig.6.12),wehave Jb = ∇ × M = 0, Kb = M × ˆn = M sin θ ˆφ. M r y z x θ φ FIGURE 6.12 276 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter Now, a rotating spherical shell, of uniform surface charge σ , corresponds to a surface current density K = σ v = σω R sin θ ˆφ. It follows, therefore, that the ﬁeld of a uniformly magnetized sphere is identi- cal to the ﬁeld of a spinning spherical shell, with the identiﬁcation σ Rωωω → M. Referring back to Ex. 5.11, I conclude that B = 2 3 μ0M, (6.16) inside the sphere, while the ﬁeld outside is the same as that of a perfect dipole, m = 4 3 π R3M. Notice that the internal ﬁeld is uniform, like the electric ﬁeld inside a uniformly polarized sphere (Eq. 4.14), although the actual formulas for the two cases are curiously different ( 2 3 in place of − 1 3 ) .6 The external ﬁelds are also analogous: pure dipole in both instances. Problem 6.7 An inﬁnitely long circular cylinder carries a uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. Find the magnetic ﬁeld (due to M) inside and outside the cylinder. Problem 6.8 A long circular cylinder of radius R carries a magnetization M = ks2 ˆφ,where k is a constant, s is the distance from the axis, and ˆφ is the usual azimuthal unit vector (Fig. 6.13). Find the magnetic ﬁeld due to M, for points inside and outside the cylinder. z R y s φ x FIGURE 6.13 w M a a FIGURE 6.14 6It is no accident that the same factors appear in the “contact” term for the ﬁelds of electric and magnetic dipoles (Eqs. 3.106 and 5.94). In fact, one good way to model a perfect dipole is to take the limit (R → 0) of a polarized/magnetized sphere. 6.2 The Field of a Magnetized Object 277 Problem 6.9 A short circular cylinder of radius a and length L carries a “frozen-in” uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. Find the bound current, and sketch the magnetic ﬁeld of the cylinder. (Make three sketches: one for L ≫ a, one for L ≪ a, and one for L ≈ a.) Compare this bar magnet with the bar electret of Prob. 4.11. Problem 6.10 An iron rod of length L and square cross section (side a)isgiven a uniform longitudinal magnetization M, and then bent around into a circle with a narrow gap (width w), as shown in Fig. 6.14. Find the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of the gap, assuming w ≪ a ≪ L.[Hint: treat it as the superposition of a complete torus plus a square loop with reversed current.] 6.2.2 Physical Interpretation of Bound Currents In the last section, we found that the ﬁeld of a magnetized object is identical to the ﬁeld that would be produced by a certain distribution of “bound” currents, Jb and Kb. I want to show you how these bound currents arise physically. This will be a heuristic argument—the rigorous derivation has already been given. Figure 6.15 depicts a thin slab of uniformly magnetized material, with the dipoles represented by tiny current loops. Notice that all the “internal” currents cancel: every time there is one going to the right, a contiguous one is going to the left. However, at the edge there is no adjacent loop to do the canceling. The whole thing, then, is equivalent to a single ribbon of current I ﬂowing around the boundary (Fig. 6.16). What is this current, in terms of M? Say that each of the tiny loops has area a and thickness t (Fig. 6.17). In terms of the magnetization M, its dipole moment t I I I I I I M FIGURE 6.15 M n I I FIGURE 6.16 278 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter M I t a FIGURE 6.17 is m = Mat. In terms of the circulating current I , however, m = Ia. Therefore I = Mt, so the surface current is Kb = I /t = M. Using the outward-drawn unit vector ˆn (Fig. 6.16), the direction of Kb is conveniently indicated by the cross product: Kb = M × ˆn. (This expression also records the fact that there is no current on the top or bottom surface of the slab; here M is parallel to ˆn, so the cross product vanishes.) This bound surface current is exactly what we obtained in Sect. 6.2.1. It is a peculiar kind of current, in the sense that no single charge makes the whole trip— on the contrary, each charge moves only in a tiny little loop within a single atom. Nevertheless, the net effect is a macroscopic current ﬂowing over the surface of the magnetized object. We call it a “bound” current to remind ourselves that every charge is attached to a particular atom, but it’s a perfectly genuine current, and it produces a magnetic ﬁeld in the same way any other current does. When the magnetization is nonuniform, the internal currents no longer cancel. Figure 6.18(a) shows two adjacent chunks of magnetized material, with a larger arrow on the one to the right suggesting greater magnetization at that point. On the surface where they join, there is a net current in the x direction, given by Ix =[Mz(y + dy) − Mz(y)] dz = ∂ Mz ∂ y dy dz. The corresponding volume current density is therefore (Jb)x = ∂ Mz ∂ y . x y z Mz(y + dy) dy Mz(y) (a) dz x y z dy My(z + dz) My(z) (b) dz FIGURE 6.18 6.3 The Auxiliary Field H 279 By the same token, a nonuniform magnetization in the y direction would con- tribute an amount −∂ My/∂z (Fig. 6.18(b)), so (Jb)x = ∂ Mz ∂ y − ∂ My ∂z . In general, then, Jb = ∇ × M, consistent, again, with the result of Sect. 6.2.1. Incidentally, like any other steady current, Jb should obey the conservation law 5.33: ∇ · Jb = 0. Does it? Yes, for the divergence of a curl is always zero. 6.2.3 The Magnetic Field Inside Matter Like the electric ﬁeld, the actual microscopic magnetic ﬁeld inside matter ﬂuc- tuates wildly from point to point and instant to instant. When we speak of “the” magnetic ﬁeld in matter, we mean the macroscopic ﬁeld: the average over regions large enough to contain many atoms. (The magnetization M is “smoothed out” in the same sense.) It is this macroscopic ﬁeld that one obtains when the methods of Sect. 6.2.1 are applied to points inside magnetized material, as you can prove for yourself in the following problem. Problem 6.11 In Sect, 6.2.1, we began with the potential of a perfect dipole (Eq. 6.10), whereas in fact we are dealing with physical dipoles. Show, by the method of Sect. 4.2.3, that we nonetheless get the correct macroscopic ﬁeld. 6.3 THE AUXILIARY FIELD H 6.3.1 Ampère’s Law in Magnetized Materials In Sect. 6.2, we found that the effect of magnetization is to establish bound cur- rents Jb = ∇ × M within the material and Kb = M × ˆn on the surface. The ﬁeld due to magnetization of the medium is just the ﬁeld produced by these bound cur- rents. We are now ready to put everything together: the ﬁeld attributable to bound currents, plus the ﬁeld due to everything else—which I shall call the free current. The free current might ﬂow through wires imbedded in the magnetized substance or, if the latter is a conductor, through the material itself. In any event, the total current can be written as J = Jb + J f . (6.17) There is no new physics in Eq. 6.17; it is simply a convenience to separate the current into these two parts, because they got there by quite different means: the 280 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter free current is there because somebody hooked up a wire to a battery—it involves actual transport of charge; the bound current is there because of magnetization—it results from the conspiracy of many aligned atomic dipoles. In view of Eqs. 6.13 and 6.17, Ampère’s law can be written 1 μ0 (∇ × B) = J = J f + Jb = J f + (∇ × M), or, collecting together the two curls: ∇ × ( 1 μ0 B − M) = J f . The quantity in parentheses is designated by the letter H: H ≡ 1 μ0 B − M. (6.18) In terms of H, then, Ampère’s law reads ∇ × H = J f , (6.19) or, in integral form, √ H · dl = I fenc , (6.20) where I fenc is the total free current passing through the Amperian loop. H plays a role in magnetostatics analogous to D in electrostatics: Just as D allowed us to write Gauss’s law in terms of the free charge alone, H permits us to express Ampère’s law in terms of the free current alone—and free current is what we control directly. Bound current, like bound charge, comes along for the ride— the material gets magnetized, and this results in bound currents; we cannot turn them on or off independently, as we can free currents. In applying Eq. 6.20, all we need to worry about is the free current, which we know about because we put it there. In particular, when symmetry permits, we can calculate H immediately from Eq. 6.20 by the usual Ampère’s law methods. (For example, Probs. 6.7 and 6.8 can be done in one line by noting that H = 0.) Example 6.2. A long copper rod of radius R carries a uniformly distributed (free) current I (Fig. 6.19). Find H inside and outside the rod. Solution Copper is weakly diamagnetic, so the dipoles will line up opposite to the ﬁeld. This results in a bound current running antiparallel to I , within the wire, and parallel to I along the surface (Fig. 6.20). Just how great these bound currents will 6.3 The Auxiliary Field H 281 Amperian loop s I R FIGURE 6.19 I B M H Kb Jb FIGURE 6.20 be we are not yet in a position to say—but in order to calculate H, it is sufﬁcient to realize that all the currents are longitudinal, so B, M, and therefore also H,are circumferential. Applying Eq. 6.20 to an Amperian loop of radius s < R, H (2π s) = I fenc = I π s2 π R2 , so, inside the wire, H = I 2π R2 s ˆφ (s ≤ R). (6.21) Outside the wire H = I 2π s ˆφ (s ≥ R). (6.22) In the latter region (as always, in empty space) M = 0,so B = μ0H = μ0 I 2π s ˆφ (s ≥ R), thesameasfor a nonmagnetized wire (Ex. 5.7). Inside the wire B cannot be determined at this stage, since we have no way of knowing M (though in practice the magnetization in copper is so slight that for most purposes we can ignore it altogether). As it turns out, H is a more useful quantity than D. In the laboratory, you will frequently hear people talking about H (more often even than B), but you will never hear anyone speak of D (only E). The reason is this: To build an 282 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter electromagnet you run a certain (free) current through a coil. The current is the thing you read on the dial, and this determines H (or at any rate, the line in- tegral of H); B depends on the speciﬁc materials you used and even, if iron is present, on the history of your magnet. On the other hand, if you want to set up an electric ﬁeld, you do not plaster a known free charge on the plates of a par- allel plate capacitor; rather, you connect them to a battery of known voltage.It’s the potential difference you read on your dial, and that determines E (or rather, the line integral of E); D depends on the details of the dielectric you’re using. If it were easy to measure charge, and hard to measure potential, then you’d ﬁnd experimentalists talking about D instead of E. So the relative familiarity of H, as contrasted with D, derives from purely practical considerations; theoretically, they’re on an equal footing. Many authors call H, not B, the “magnetic ﬁeld.” Then they have to invent a new word for B: the “ﬂux density,” or magnetic “induction” (an absurd choice, since that term already has at least two other meanings in electrodynamics). Any- way, B is indisputably the fundamental quantity, so I shall continue to call it the “magnetic ﬁeld,” as everyone does in the spoken language. H has no sensible name: just call it “H.” 7 Problem 6.12 An inﬁnitely long cylinder, of radius R, carries a “frozen-in” magne- tization, parallel to the axis, M = ks ˆz, where k is a constant and s is the distance from the axis; there is no free current anywhere. Find the magnetic ﬁeld inside and outside the cylinder by two different methods: (a) As in Sect. 6.2, locate all the bound currents, and calculate the ﬁeld they produce. (b) Use Ampère’s law (in the form of Eq. 6.20) to ﬁnd H, and then get B from Eq. 6.18. (Notice that the second method is much faster, and avoids any explicit reference to the bound currents.) Problem 6.13 Suppose the ﬁeld inside a large piece of magnetic material is B0,so that H0 = (1/μ0)B0 − M,where M is a “frozen-in” magnetization. (a) Now a small spherical cavity is hollowed out of the material (Fig. 6.21). Find the ﬁeld at the center of the cavity, in terms of B0 and M.Alsoﬁnd H at the center of the cavity, in terms of H0 and M. (b) Do the same for a long needle-shaped cavity running parallel to M. (c) Do the same for a thin wafer-shaped cavity perpendicular to M. 7For those who disagree, I quote A. Sommerfeld’s Electrodynamics (New York: Academic Press, 1952), p. 45: “The unhappy term ‘magnetic ﬁeld’ for H should be avoided as far as possible. It seems to us that this term has led into error none less than Maxwell himself ...” 6.3 The Auxiliary Field H 283 (a) Sphere (b) Needle (c) Wafer M FIGURE 6.21 Assume the cavities are small enough so M, B0,and H0 are essentially constant. Compare Prob. 4.16. [Hint: Carving out a cavity is the same as superimposing an object of the same shape but opposite magnetization.] 6.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel Equation 6.19 looks just like Ampère’s original law (Eq. 5.56), except that the total current is replaced by the free current, and B is replaced by μ0H.Asinthe case of D, however, I must warn you against reading too much into this corre- spondence. It does not say that μ0H is “just like B, only its source is J f instead of J.” For the curl alone does not determine a vector ﬁeld—you must also know the divergence. And whereas ∇ · B = 0, the divergence of H is not, in general, zero. In fact, from Eq. 6.18 ∇ · H =−∇ · M. (6.23) Only when the divergence of M vanishes is the parallel between B and μ0H faithful. If you think I’m being pedantic, consider the example of the bar magnet—a short cylinder of iron that carries a permanent uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. (See Probs. 6.9 and 6.14.) In this case there is no free current any- where, and a naïve application of Eq. 6.20 might lead you to suppose that H = 0, and hence that B = μ0M inside the magnet and B = 0 outside, which is non- sense. It is quite true that the curl of H vanishes everywhere, but the divergence does not. (Can you see where ∇ · M ̸= 0?) Advice: When you are asked to ﬁnd B or H in a problem involving magnetic materials, ﬁrst look for symmetry. If the problem exhibits cylindrical, plane, solenoidal, or toroidal symmetry, then you can get H directly from Eq. 6.20 by the usual Ampère’s law methods. (Evidently, in such cases ∇ · M is automatically zero, since the free current alone determines the answer.) If the requisite symmetry is absent, you’ll have to think of another 284 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter approach, and in particular you must not assume that H is zero just because there is no free current in sight. 6.3.3 Boundary Conditions The magnetostatic boundary conditions of Sect. 5.4.2 can be rewritten in terms of H and the free current. From Eq. 6.23 it follows that H ⊥ above − H ⊥ below =−(M ⊥ above − M ⊥ below), (6.24) while Eq. 6.19 says H ∥ above − H ∥ below = K f × ˆn. (6.25) In the presence of materials, these are sometimes more useful than the correspond- ing boundary conditions on B (Eqs. 5.74 and 5.76): B⊥ above − B⊥ below = 0, (6.26) and B ∥ above − B ∥ below = μ0(K × ˆn). (6.27) You might want to check them, for Ex. 6.2 or Prob. 6.14. Problem 6.14 For the bar magnet of Prob. 6.9, make careful sketches of M, B,and H, assuming L is about 2a. Compare Prob. 4.17. Problem 6.15 If J f = 0 everywhere, the curl of H vanishes (Eq. 6.19), and we can express H as the gradient of a scalar potential W : H =−∇W. According to Eq. 6.23, then, ∇ 2W = (∇ · M), so W obeys Poisson’s equation, with ∇ · M as the “source.” This opens up all the machinery of Chapter 3. As an example, ﬁnd the ﬁeld inside a uniformly magne- tized sphere (Ex. 6.1) by separation of variables. [Hint: ∇ · M = 0everywhereex- cept at the surface (r = R), so W satisﬁes Laplace’s equation in the regions r < R and r > R; use Eq. 3.65, and from Eq. 6.24 ﬁgure out the appropriate boundary condition on W .] 6.4 LINEAR AND NONLINEAR MEDIA 6.4.1 Magnetic Susceptibility and Permeability In paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, the magnetization is sustained by the ﬁeld; when B is removed, M disappears. In fact, for most substances the mag- netization is proportional to the ﬁeld, provided the ﬁeld is not too strong. For 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 285 notational consistency with the electrical case (Eq. 4.30), I should express the proportionality thus: M = 1 μ0 χmB (incorrect!). (6.28) But custom dictates that it be written in terms of H, instead of B: M = χmH. (6.29) The constant of proportionality χm is called the magnetic susceptibility;itisa dimensionless quantity that varies from one substance to another—positive for paramagnets and negative for diamagnets. Typical values are around 10 −5 (see Table 6.1). Materials that obey Eq. 6.29 are called linear media. In view of Eq. 6.18, B = μ0(H + M) = μ0(1 + χm)H, (6.30) for linear media. Thus B is also proportional to H: 8 B = μH, (6.31) where μ ≡ μ0(1 + χm). (6.32) μ is called the permeability of the material. 9 In a vacuum, where there is no matter to magnetize, the susceptibility χm vanishes, and the permeability is μ0. That’s why μ0 is called the permeability of free space.

Data from Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 91st ed. (Boca Raton: CRC Press, Inc., 2010) and other references. 8Physically, therefore, Eq. 6.28 would say exactly the same as Eq. 6.29, only the constant χm would have a different value. Equation 6.29 is a little more convenient, because experimentalists ﬁnd it handier to work with H than B. 9If you factor out μ0, what’s left is called the relative permeability: μr ≡ 1 + χm = μ/μ0.Bythe way, formulas for H in terms of B (Eq. 6.31, in the case of linear media) are called constitutive relations, just like those for D in terms of E. 286 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter Example 6.3. An inﬁnite solenoid (n turns per unit length, current I ) is ﬁlled with linear material of susceptibility χm. Find the magnetic ﬁeld inside the solenoid. φ z FIGURE 6.22 Solution Since B is due in part to bound currents (which we don’t yet know), we cannot compute it directly. However, this is one of those symmetrical cases in which we can get H from the free current alone, using Ampère’s law in the form of Eq. 6.20: H = nI ˆz (Fig. 6.22). According to Eq. 6.31, then, B = μ0(1 + χm)nI ˆz. If the medium is paramagnetic, the ﬁeld is slightly enhanced; if it’s diamagnetic, the ﬁeld is somewhat reduced. This reﬂects the fact that the bound surface current Kb = M × ˆn = χm(H × ˆn) = χmnI ˆφ is in the same direction as I , in the former case (χm > 0), and opposite in the latter (χm < 0). You might suppose that linear media escape the defect in the parallel between B and H: since M and H are now proportional to B, does it not follow that their divergence, like B’s, must always vanish? Unfortunately, it does not; 10 at the boundary between two materials of different permeability, the divergence of M can actually be inﬁnite. For instance, at the end of a cylinder of linear para- magnetic material, M is zero on one side but not on the other. For the “Gaussian pillbox” shown in Fig. 6.23, ∮ M · da ̸= 0, and hence, by the divergence theorem, ∇ · M cannot vanish everywhere within it. 10Formally, ∇ · H = ∇ · ( 1 μ B) = 1 μ ∇ · B + B · ∇ ( 1 μ ) = B · ∇ ( 1 μ ),so H is not divergenceless (in general) at points where μ is changing. 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 287 M Paramagnet Gaussian pillbox M = 0 Vacuum FIGURE 6.23 Incidentally, the volume bound current density in a homogeneous linear mate- rial is proportional to the free current density: Jb = ∇ × M = ∇ × (χmH) = χmJ f . (6.33) In particular, unless free current actually ﬂows through the material, all bound current will be at the surface. Problem 6.16 A coaxial cable consists of two very long cylindrical tubes, separated by linear insulating material of magnetic susceptibility χm. A current I ﬂows down the inner conductor and returns along the outer one; in each case, the current dis- tributes itself uniformly over the surface (Fig. 6.24). Find the magnetic ﬁeld in the region between the tubes. As a check, calculate the magnetization and the bound currents, and conﬁrm that (together, of course, with the free currents) they generate the correct ﬁeld. I I b a FIGURE 6.24 Problem 6.17 A current I ﬂows down a long straight wire of radius a.Ifthe wire is made of linear material (copper, say, or aluminum) with susceptibility χm,and the current is distributed uniformly, what is the magnetic ﬁeld a distance s from the axis? Find all the bound currents. What is the net bound current ﬂowing down the wire? Problem 6.18 A sphere of linear magnetic material is placed in an otherwise uni-! form magnetic ﬁeld B0. Find the new ﬁeld inside the sphere. [Hint: See Prob. 6.15 or Prob. 4.23.] Problem 6.19 On the basis of the naïve model presented in Sect. 6.1.3, estimate the magnetic susceptibility of a diamagnetic metal such as copper. Compare your answer with the empirical value in Table 6.1, and comment on any discrepancy. 288 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter 6.4.2 Ferromagnetism In a linear medium, the alignment of atomic dipoles is maintained by a magnetic ﬁeld imposed from the outside. Ferromagnets—which are emphatically not lin- ear11—require no external ﬁelds to sustain the magnetization; the alignment is “frozen in.” Like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism involves the magnetic dipoles associated with the spins of unpaired electrons. The new feature, which makes fer- romagnetism so different from paramagnetism, is the interaction between nearby dipoles: In a ferromagnet, each dipole “likes” to point in the same direction as its neighbors.The reason for this preference is essentially quantum mechanical, and I shall not endeavor to explain it here; it is enough to know that the correlation is so strong as to align virtually 100% of the unpaired electron spins. If you could somehow magnify a piece of iron and “see” the individual dipoles as tiny arrows, it would look something like Fig. 6.25, with all the spins pointing the same way. But if that is true, why isn’t every wrench and nail a powerful magnet? The answer is that the alignment occurs in relatively small patches, called domains. Each domain contains billions of dipoles, all lined up (these domains are actually visible under a microscope, using suitable etching techniques—see Fig. 6.26), but the domains themselves are randomly oriented. The household wrench contains an enormous number of domains, and their magnetic ﬁelds cancel, so the wrench as a whole is not magnetized. (Actually, the orientation of domains is not completely random; within a given crystal, there may be some preferential alignment along the crystal axes. But there will be just as many domains pointing one way as the other, so there is still no large-scale magnetization. Moreover, the crystals themselves are randomly oriented within any sizable chunk of metal.) How, then, would you produce a permanent magnet, such as they sell in toy stores? If you put a piece of iron into a strong magnetic ﬁeld, the torque N = m × B tends to align the dipoles parallel to the ﬁeld. Since they like to stay parallel to their neighbors, most of the dipoles will resist this torque. However, FIGURE 6.25 11In this sense, it is misleading to speak of the susceptibility or permeability of a ferromagnet. The terms are used for such materials, but they refer to the proportionality factor between a differential increase in H and the resulting differential change in M (or B); moreover, they are not constants, but functions of H. 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 289 Ferromagnetic domains. (Photo courtesy of R. W. DeBlois) FIGURE 6.26 at the boundary between two domains, there are competing neighbors, and the torque will throw its weight on the side of the domain most nearly parallel to the ﬁeld; this domain will win some converts, at the expense of the less favorably ori- ented one. The net effect of the magnetic ﬁeld, then, is to move the domain bound- aries. Domains parallel to the ﬁeld grow, and the others shrink. If the ﬁeld is strong enough, one domain takes over entirely, and the iron is said to be saturated. It turns out that this process (the shifting of domain boundaries in response to an external ﬁeld) is not entirely reversible: When the ﬁeld is switched off, there will be some return to randomly oriented domains, but it is far from complete— there remains a preponderance of domains in the original direction. You now have a permanent magnet. A simple way to accomplish this, in practice, is to wrap a coil of wire around the object to be magnetized (Fig. 6.27). Run a current I through the coil; this pro- vides the external magnetic ﬁeld (pointing to the left in the diagram). As you in- crease the current, the ﬁeld increases, the domain boundaries move, and the mag- netization grows. Eventually, you reach the saturation point, with all the dipoles aligned, and a further increase in current has no effect on M (Fig. 6.28, point b). Now suppose you reduce the current. Instead of retracing the path back to M = 0, there is only a partial return to randomly oriented domains; M decreases, but even with the current off there is some residual magnetization (point c). The wrench is now a permanent magnet. If you want to eliminate the remaining mag- netization, you’ll have to run a current backwards through the coil (a negative I ). Now the external ﬁeld points to the right, and as you increase I (negatively), 290 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter I FIGURE 6.27 M drops down to zero (point d). If you turn I still higher, you soon reach sat- uration in the other direction—all the dipoles now pointing to the right (e). At this stage, switching off the current will leave the wrench with a permanent mag- netization to the right (point f ). To complete the story, turn I on again in the positive sense: M returns to zero (point g), and eventually to the forward satura- tion point (b). The path we have traced out is called a hysteresis loop. Notice that the mag- netization of the wrench depends not only on the applied ﬁeld (that is, on I ), but also on its previous magnetic “history.” 12 For instance, at three different times in our experiment the current was zero (a, c, and f ), yet the magnetization was dif- ferent for each of them. Actually, it is customary to draw hysteresis loops as plots of B against H , rather than M against I . (If our coil is approximated by a long solenoid, with n turns per unit length, then H = nI ,so H and I are proportional. Meanwhile, B = μ0(H + M), but in practice M is huge compared to H ,sotoall intents and purposes B is proportional to M.) To make the units consistent (teslas), I have plotted (μ0 H ) horizontally (Fig. 6.29); notice, however, that the vertical scale is 104 times greater than the horizontal one. Roughly speaking, μ0H is the ﬁeld our coil would have produced in the absence of any iron; B is what we actually got, and compared to μ0H,itis gigantic. A little current goes a long way, when you have ferromagnetic materials I M e ag c b d f (Permanent Magnet) (Saturation) (Permanent Magnet)(Saturation) FIGURE 6.28 12Etymologically, the word hysteresis has nothing to do with the word history—nor with the word hysteria. It derives from a Greek verb meaning “lag behind.” 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 291 1.5 −15 1 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −10 −5 5 10 15 (μ0H 10 4)20 × B FIGURE 6.29 around. That’s why anyone who wants to make a powerful electromagnet will wrap the coil around an iron core. It doesn’t take much of an external ﬁeld to move the domain boundaries, and when you do that, you have all the dipoles in the iron working with you. One ﬁnal point about ferromagnetism: It all follows, remember, from the fact that the dipoles within a given domain line up parallel to one another. Ran- dom thermal motions compete with this ordering, but as long as the temperature doesn’t get too high, they cannot budge the dipoles out of line. It’s not surprising, though, that very high temperatures do destroy the alignment. What is surprising is that this occurs at a precise temperature (770 ◦ C, for iron). Below this temper- ature (called the Curie point), iron is ferromagnetic; above, it is paramagnetic. The Curie point is rather like the boiling point or the freezing point in that there is no gradual transition from ferro- to para-magnetic behavior, any more than there is between water and ice. These abrupt changes in the properties of a substance, occurring at sharply deﬁned temperatures, are known in statistical mechanics as phase transitions. Problem 6.20 How would you go about demagnetizing a permanent magnet (such as the wrench we have been discussing, at point c in the hysteresis loop)? That is, how could you restore it to its original state, with M = 0at I = 0? Problem 6.21 (a) Show that the energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic ﬁeld B is U =−m · B. (6.34) [Assume that the magnitude of the dipole moment is ﬁxed, and all you have to do is move it into place and rotate it into its ﬁnal orientation. The energy re- quired to keep the current ﬂowing is a different problem, which we will confront in Chapter 7.] Compare Eq. 4.6. 292 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter m1 m2 rθ1 θ2 FIGURE 6.30 (b) Show that the interaction energy of two magnetic dipoles separated by a dis- placement r is given by U = μ0 4π 1 r 3 [m1 · m2 − 3(m1 · ˆr)(m2 · ˆr)]. (6.35) Compare Eq. 4.7. (c) Express your answer to (b) in terms of the angles θ1 and θ2 in Fig. 6.30, and use the result to ﬁnd the stable conﬁguration two dipoles would adopt if held a ﬁxed distance apart, but left free to rotate. (d) Suppose you had a large collection of compass needles, mounted on pins at regular intervals along a straight line. How would they point (assuming the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld can be neglected)? [A rectangular array of compass nee- dles aligns itself spontaneously, and this is sometimes used as a demonstration of “ferromagnetic” behavior on a large scale. It’s a bit of a fraud, however, since the mechanism here is purely classical, and much weaker than the quantum me- chanical exchange forces that are actually responsible for ferromagnetism.13] More Problems on Chapter 6 Problem 6.22 In Prob. 6.4, you calculated the force on a dipole by “brute force.”! Here’s a more elegant approach. First write B(r) as a Taylor expansion about the center of the loop: B(r) ∼= B(r0) +[(r − r0) · ∇0]B(r0), where r0 is the position of the dipole and ∇0 denotes differentiation with respect to r0. Put this into the Lorentz force law (Eq. 5.16) to obtain F = I √ dl ×[(r · ∇0)B(r0)]. Or, numbering the Cartesian coordinates from 1 to 3: Fi = I 3∑ j,k,l=1 ϵijk {√ rl dl j } [ ∇0l Bk(r0)] , where ϵijk is the Levi-Civita symbol (+1if ijk = 123, 231, or 312; −1if ijk = 132, 213, or 321; 0 otherwise), in terms of which the cross-product can be written (A × B)i = ∑3 j,k=1 ϵijk A j Bk. Use Eq. 1.108 to evaluate the integral. Note that 3∑ j=1 ϵijkϵljm = δil δkm − δimδkl , where δij is the Kronecker delta (Prob. 3.52). 13For an intriguing exception, see B.

Treat the magnets as dipoles, with mass md and dipole moment m. (a) If you put two back-to-back magnets on the rod, the upper one will “ﬂoat”—the magnetic force upward balancing the gravitational force downward. At what height (z) does it ﬂoat? (b) If you now add a third magnet (parallel to the bottom one), what is the ratio of the two heights? (Determine the actual number, to three signiﬁcant digits.) [Answer: (a) [3μ0m2/2π md g]1/4; (b) 0.8501] Problem 6.24 Imagine two charged magnetic dipoles (charge q, dipole moment m), constrained to move on the z axis (same as Problem 6.23(a), but without gravity). Electrically they repel, but magnetically (if both m’s point in the z direction) they attract. (a) Find the equilibrium separation distance. (b) What is the equilibrium separation for two electrons in this orientation. [Answer: 4.72 × 10 −13 m.] (c) Does there exist, then, a stable bound state of two electrons? Problem 6.25 Notice the following parallel: { ∇ · D = 0, ∇ × E = 0,ϵ0E = D − P,(no free charge); ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × H = 0,μ0H = B − μ0M,(no free current). Thus, the transcription D → B, E → H, P → μ0M, ϵ0 → μ0 turns an electrostatic problem into an analogous magnetostatic one. Use this, together with your knowl- edge of the electrostatic results, to rederive (a) the magnetic ﬁeld inside a uniformly magnetized sphere (Eq. 6.16); (b) the magnetic ﬁeld inside a sphere of linear magnetic material in an otherwise uniform magnetic ﬁeld (Prob. 6.18); 294 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter (c) the average magnetic ﬁeld over a sphere, due to steady currents within the sphere (Eq. 5.93). Problem 6.26 Compare Eqs. 2.15, 4.9, and 6.11. Notice that if ρ, P,and M are uniform,the same integral is involved in all three: ∫ ˆr r2 dτ ;. Therefore, if you happen to know the electric ﬁeld of a uniformly charged object, you can immediately write down the scalar potential of a uniformly polarized ob- ject, and the vector potential of a uniformly magnetized object, of the same shape. Use this observation to obtain V inside and outside a uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2), and A inside and outside a uniformly magnetized sphere (Ex. 6.1). μ2 μ1 B2 B1θ1 θ2 FIGURE 6.32 Problem 6.27 At the interface between one linear magnetic material and another, the magnetic ﬁeld lines bend (Fig. 6.32).

What is the ﬁeld outside the sphere? Problem 6.29 You are asked to referee a grant application, which proposes to deter- mine whether the magnetization of iron is due to “Ampère” dipoles (current loops) or “Gilbert” dipoles (separated magnetic monopoles). The experiment will involve a cylinder of iron (radius R and length L = 10R), uniformly magnetized along the direction of its axis. If the dipoles are Ampère-type, the magnetization is equivalent to a surface bound current Kb = M ˆφ; if they are Gilbert-type, the magnetization is equivalent to surface monopole densities σb =±M at the two ends. Unfortunately, these two conﬁgurations produce identical magnetic ﬁelds, at exterior points. How- ever, the interior ﬁelds are radically different—in the ﬁrst case B is in the same 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 295 general direction as M, whereas in the second it is roughly opposite to M.The ap- plicant proposes to measure this internal ﬁeld by carving out a small cavity and ﬁnding the torque on a tiny compass needle placed inside. Assuming that the obvious technical difﬁculties can be overcome, and that the question itself is worthy of study, would you advise funding this experiment? If so, what shape cavity would you recommend? If not, what is wrong with the proposal? [Hint: Refer to Probs. 4.11, 4.16, 6.9, and 6.13.] CHAPTER 7 Electrodynamics 7.1 ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 7.1.1 Ohm’s Law To make a current ﬂow, you have to push on the charges. How fast they move, in response to a given push, depends on the nature of the material. For most sub- stances, the current density J is proportional to the force per unit charge, f: J = σ f. (7.1) The proportionality factor σ (not to be confused with surface charge) is an empir- ical constant that varies from one material to another; it’s called the conductivity of the medium. Actually, the handbooks usually list the reciprocal of σ , called the resistivity: ρ = 1/σ (not to be confused with charge density—I’m sorry, but we’re running out of Greek letters, and this is the standard notation). Some typical values are listed in Table 7.1. Notice that even insulators conduct slightly, though the conductivity of a metal is astronomically greater; in fact, for most purposes metals can be regarded as perfect conductors, with σ =∞, while for insulators we can pretend σ = 0. In principle, the force that drives the charges to produce the current could be anything—chemical, gravitational, or trained ants with tiny harnesses. For our purposes, though, it’s usually an electromagnetic force that does the job. In this case Eq. 7.1 becomes J = σ(E + v × B). (7.2) Ordinarily, the velocity of the charges is sufﬁciently small that the second term can be ignored: J = σ E. (7.3) (However, in plasmas, for instance, the magnetic contribution to f can be signif- icant.) Equation 7.3 is called Ohm’s law, though the physics behind it is really contained in Eq. 7.1, of which 7.3 is just a special case. I know: you’re confused because I said E = 0 inside a conductor (Sect. 2.5.1). But that’s for stationary charges (J = 0). Moreover, for perfect conductors 296 7.1 Electromotive Force 297 Material Resistivity Material Resistivity Conductors: Semiconductors: Silver 1.59 × 10 −8 Sea water 0.2 Copper 1.68 × 10 −8 Germanium 0.46 Gold 2.21 × 10 −8 Diamond 2.7 Aluminum 2.65 × 10 −8 Silicon 2500 Iron 9.61 × 10 −8 Insulators: Mercury 9.61 × 10 −7 Water (pure) 8.3 × 10 3 Nichrome 1.08 × 10 −6 Glass 10 9 − 10 14 Manganese 1.44 × 10 −6 Rubber 10 13 − 10 15 Graphite 1.6 × 10 −5 Teﬂon 10 22 − 10 24 TABLE 7.1 Resistivities, in ohm-meters (all values are for 1 atm, 20 ◦ C). Data from Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 91st ed. (Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, 2010) and other references. E = J/σ = 0 even if current is ﬂowing. In practice, metals are such good con- ductors that the electric ﬁeld required to drive current in them is negligible. Thus we routinely treat the connecting wires in electric circuits (for example) as equipo- tentials. Resistors, by contrast, are made from poorly conducting materials. Example 7.1. A cylindrical resistor of cross-sectional area A and length L is made from material with conductivity σ . (See Fig. 7.1; as indicated, the cross section need not be circular, but I do assume it is the same all the way down.) If we stipulate that the potential is constant over each end, and the potential difference between the ends is V , what current ﬂows? E L z A FIGURE 7.1 Solution As it turns out, the electric ﬁeld is uniform within the wire (I’ll prove this in a moment). It follows from Eq. 7.3 that the current density is also uniform, so I = JA = σ EA = σ A L V. 298 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Example 7.2. Two long coaxial metal cylinders (radii a and b) are separated by material of conductivity σ (Fig. 7.2). If they are maintained at a potential difference V , what current ﬂows from one to the other, in a length L? E L a b FIGURE 7.2 Solution The ﬁeld between the cylinders is E = λ 2π<0s ˆs, where λ is the charge per unit length on the inner cylinder. The current is therefore I = √ J · da = σ √ E · da = σ <0 λL . (The integral is over any surface enclosing the inner cylinder.) Meanwhile, the potential difference between the cylinders is V =− √ a b E · dl = λ 2π<0 ln ( b a ) , so I = 2πσ L ln (b/a) V. As these examples illustrate, the total current ﬂowing from one electrode to the other is proportional to the potential difference between them: V = IR. (7.4) This, of course, is the more familiar version of Ohm’s law. The constant of propor- tionality R is called the resistance; it’s a function of the geometry of the arrange- ment and the conductivity of the medium between the electrodes. (In Ex. 7.1, R = (L/σ A); in Ex. 7.2, R = ln (b/a)/2πσ L.) Resistance is measured in ohms (\u0007): an ohm is a volt per ampere. Notice that the proportionality between V and I 7.1 Electromotive Force 299 is a direct consequence of Eq. 7.3: if you want to double V , you simply double the charge on the electrodes—that doubles E, which (for an ohmic material) doubles J, which doubles I . For steady currents and uniform conductivity, ∇ · E = 1 σ ∇ · J = 0, (7.5) (Eq. 5.33), and therefore the charge density is zero; any unbalanced charge re- sides on the surface. (We proved this long ago, for the case of stationary charges, using the fact that E = 0; evidently, it is still true when the charges are allowed to move.) It follows, in particular, that Laplace’s equation holds within a homo- geneous ohmic material carrying a steady current, so all the tools and tricks of Chapter 3 are available for calculating the potential. Example 7.3. I asserted that the ﬁeld in Ex. 7.1 is uniform. Let’s prove it. Solution Within the cylinder V obeys Laplace’s equation. What are the boundary condi- tions? At the left end the potential is constant—we may as well set it equal to zero. At the right end the potential is likewise constant—call it V0. On the cylin- drical surface, J · ˆn = 0, or else charge would be leaking out into the surround- ing space (which we take to be nonconducting). Therefore E · ˆn = 0, and hence ∂ V /∂n = 0. With V or its normal derivative speciﬁed on all surfaces, the poten- tial is uniquely determined (Prob. 3.5). But it’s easy to guess one potential that obeys Laplace’s equation and ﬁts these boundary conditions: V (z) = V0z L , where z is measured along the axis. The uniqueness theorem guarantees that this is the solution. The corresponding ﬁeld is E =−∇V =− V0 L ˆz, which is indeed uniform. □ Contrast the enormously more difﬁcult problem that arises if the conducting material is removed, leaving only a metal plate at either end (Fig. 7.3). Evidently V = 0 V0 E FIGURE 7.3 300 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics in the present case charge arranges itself over the surface of the wire in just such a way as to produce a nice uniform ﬁeld within. 1 I don’t suppose there is any formula in physics more familiar than Ohm’s law, and yet it’s not really a true law, in the sense of Coulomb’s or Ampère’s; rather, it is a “rule of thumb” that applies pretty well to many substances. You’re not going to win a Nobel prize for ﬁnding an exception. In fact, when you stop to think about it, it’s a little surprising that Ohm’s law ever holds. After all, a given ﬁeld E produces a force qE (on a charge q), and according to Newton’s second law, the charge will accelerate. But if the charges are accelerating, why doesn’t the current increase with time, growing larger and larger the longer you leave the ﬁeld on? Ohm’s law implies, on the contrary, that a constant ﬁeld produces a constant current, which suggests a constant velocity. Isn’t that a contradiction to Newton’s law? No, for we are forgetting the frequent collisions electrons make as they pass down the wire. It’s a little like this: Suppose you’re driving down a street with a stop sign at every intersection, so that, although you accelerate constantly in between, you are obliged to start all over again with each new block. Your average speed is then a constant, in spite of the fact that (save for the periodic abrupt stops) you are always accelerating. If the length of a block is λ and your acceleration is a, the time it takes to go a block is t = √ 2λ a , and hence your average velocity is vave = 1 2 at = √ λa 2 . But wait! That’s no good either! It says that the velocity is proportional to the square root of the acceleration, and therefore that the current should be propor- tional to the square root of the ﬁeld! There’s another twist to the story: In practice, the charges are already moving very fast because of their thermal energy. But the thermal velocities have random directions, and average to zero. The drift velocity we are concerned with is a tiny extra bit (Prob. 5.20). So the time between col- lisions is actually much shorter than we supposed; if we assume for the sake of argument that all charges travel the same distance λ between collisions, then t = λ vthermal , and therefore vave = 1 2 at = aλ 2vthermal . 1Calculating this surface charge is not easy. See, for example, J. D. Jackson, Am.J.Phys. 64, 855 (1996). Nor is it a simple matter to determine the ﬁeld outside the wire—see Prob. 7.43. 7.1 Electromotive Force 301 If there are n molecules per unit volume, and f free electrons per molecule, each with charge q and mass m, the current density is J = nf qvave = nf qλ 2vthermal F m = ( nf λq 2 2mvthermal ) E. (7.6) I don’t claim that the term in parentheses is an accurate formula for the con- ductivity, 2 but it does indicate the basic ingredients, and it correctly predicts that conductivity is proportional to the density of the moving charges and (ordinarily) decreases with increasing temperature. As a result of all the collisions, the work done by the electrical force is con- verted into heat in the resistor. Since the work done per unit charge is V and the charge ﬂowing per unit time is I , the power delivered is P = VI = I 2 R. (7.7) This is the Joule heating law. With I in amperes and R in ohms, P comes out in watts (joules per second). Problem 7.1 Two concentric metal spherical shells, of radius a and b, respectively, are separated by weakly conducting material of conductivity σ (Fig. 7.4a). (a) If they are maintained at a potential difference V , what current ﬂows from one to the other? (b) What is the resistance between the shells? (c) Notice that if b ; a the outer radius (b) is irrelevant. How do you account for that? Exploit this observation to determine the current ﬂowing between two metal spheres, each of radius a, immersed deep in the sea and held quite far apart (Fig. 7.4b), if the potential difference between them is V . (This arrangement can be used to measure the conductivity of sea water.) a b (a) σ (b) FIGURE 7.4 2This classical model (due to Drude) bears little resemblance to the modern quantum theory of con- ductivity.

Find the re- sistance between the cylinders. [Hint: Because σ is a function of position, Eq. 7.5 does not hold, the charge density is not zero in the resistive medium, and E does not go like 1/s.But we do know that for steady currents I is the same across each cylindrical surface. Take it from there.] 7.1.2 Electromotive Force If you think about a typical electric circuit—a battery hooked up to a light bulb, say (Fig. 7.7)—a perplexing question arises: In practice, the current is the same all the way around the loop; why is this the case, when the only obvious driving force is inside the battery? Off hand, you might expect a large current in the battery and none at all in the lamp. Who’s doing the pushing, in the rest of the circuit, and how does it happen that this push is exactly right to produce the same current in each segment? What’s more, given that the charges in a typical wire move (literally) at a snail’s pace (see Prob. 5.20), why doesn’t it take half an hour for the current to reach the light bulb? How do all the charges know to start moving at the same instant? Answer: If the current were not the same all the way around (for instance, dur- ing the ﬁrst split second after the switch is closed), then charge would be piling up somewhere, and—here’s the crucial point—the electric ﬁeld of this accumulating charge is in such a direction as to even out the ﬂow. Suppose, for instance, that the current into the bend in Fig. 7.8 is greater than the current out. Then charge piles up at the “knee,” and this produces a ﬁeld aiming away from the kink.3 This ﬁeld opposes the current ﬂowing in (slowing it down) and promotes the current ﬂowing out (speeding it up) until these currents are equal, at which point there is no further accumulation of charge, and equilibrium is established. It’s a beautiful system, automatically self-correcting to keep the current uniform, and it does it all so quickly that, in practice, you can safely assume the current is the same all around the circuit, even in systems that oscillate at radio frequencies. FIGURE 7.7 Iin Iout E E + + + + + ++ FIGURE 7.8 3The amount of charge involved is surprisingly small—see W. G. V. Rosser, Am. J. Phys. 38,265 (1970); nevertheless, the resulting ﬁeld can be detected experimentally—see R. Jacobs, A. de Salazar, and A. Nassar, Am.J.Phys. 78, 1432 (2010). 304 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics There are really two forces involved in driving current around a circuit: the source, fs, which is ordinarily conﬁned to one portion of the loop (a battery, say), and an electrostatic force, which serves to smooth out the ﬂow and communicate the inﬂuence of the source to distant parts of the circuit: f = fs + E. (7.8) The physical agency responsible for fs can be many different things: in a battery it’s a chemical force; in a piezoelectric crystal mechanical pressure is converted into an electrical impulse; in a thermocouple it’s a temperature gradient that does the job; in a photoelectric cell it’s light; and in a Van de Graaff generator the electrons are literally loaded onto a conveyer belt and swept along. Whatever the mechanism, its net effect is determined by the line integral of f around the circuit: E ≡ ∮ f · dl = ∮ fs · dl. (7.9) (Because ∮ E · dl = 0 for electrostatic ﬁelds, it doesn’t matter whether you use f or fs.) E is called the electromotive force,or emf, of the circuit. It’s a lousy term, since this is not a force at all—it’s the integral of a force per unit charge. Some people prefer the word electromotance, but emf is so established that I think we’d better stick with it. Within an ideal source of emf (a resistanceless battery,4 for instance), the net force on the charges is zero (Eq. 7.1 with σ =∞), so E =−fs. The potential difference between the terminals (a and b) is therefore V =− √ b a E · dl = √ b a fs · dl = ∮ fs · dl = E (7.10) (we can extend the integral to the entire loop because fs = 0 outside the source). The function of a battery, then, is to establish and maintain a voltage difference equal to the electromotive force (a 6 V battery, for example, holds the positive ter- minal 6 V above the negative terminal). The resulting electrostatic ﬁeld drives cur- rent around the rest of the circuit (notice, however, that inside the battery fs drives current in the direction opposite to E).5 Because it’s the line integral of fs, E can be interpreted as the work done per unit charge, by the source—indeed, in some books electromotive force is deﬁned this way. However, as you’ll see in the next section, there is some subtlety in- volved in this interpretation, so I prefer Eq. 7.9. 4Real batteries have a certain internal resistance, r , and the potential difference between their termi- nals is E − Ir , when a current I is ﬂowing. For an illuminating discussion of how batteries work, see D. Roberts, Am.J.Phys. 51, 829 (1983). 5Current in an electric circuit is somewhat analogous to the ﬂow of water in a closed system of pipes, with gravity playing the role of the electrostatic ﬁeld, and a pump (lifting the water up against gravity) in the role of the battery. In this story height is analogous to voltage. 7.1 Electromotive Force 305 Problem 7.5 A battery of emf E and internal resistance r is hooked up to a variable “load” resistance, R. If you want to deliver the maximum possible power to the load, what resistance R should you choose? (You can’t change E and r , of course.) −σ +σ E Rh FIGURE 7.9 Problem 7.6 A rectangular loop of wire is situated so that one end (height h)is between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 7.9), oriented parallel to the ﬁeld E. The other end is way outside, where the ﬁeld is essentially zero. What is the emf in this loop? If the total resistance is R, what current ﬂows? Explain. [Warning: This is a trick question, so be careful; if you have invented a perpetual motion machine, there’s probably something wrong with it.] 7.1.3 Motional emf In the last section, I listed several possible sources of electromotive force, batteries being the most familiar. But I did not mention the commonest one of all: the generator. Generators exploit motional emfs, which arise when you move a wire through a magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 7.10 suggests a primitive model for a generator. In the shaded region there is a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B, pointing into the page, and the resistor R represents whatever it is (maybe a light bulb or a toaster) we’re trying to drive current through. If the entire loop is pulled to the right with speed v, the charges in segment ab experience a magnetic force whose vertical component qv B drives current around the loop, in the clockwise direction. The emf is E = ∮ fmag · dl = v Bh, (7.11) where h is the width of the loop. (The horizontal segments bc and ad contribute nothing, since the force there is perpendicular to the wire.) Notice that the integral you perform to calculate E (Eq. 7.9 or 7.11) is carried out at one instant of time—take a “snapshot” of the loop, if you like, and work R vh c d x b a FIGURE 7.10 306 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics from that. Thus dl, for the segment ab in Fig. 7.10, points straight up, even though the loop is moving to the right. You can’t quarrel with this—it’s simply the way emf is deﬁned—but it is important to be clear about it. In particular, although the magnetic force is responsible for establishing the emf, it is not doing any work—magnetic forces never do work. Who, then, is supplying the energy that heats the resistor? Answer: The person who’s pulling on the loop. With the current ﬂowing, the free charges in segment ab have a vertical velocity (call it u) in addition to the horizontal velocity v they inherit from the motion of the loop. Accordingly, the magnetic force has a component qu B to the left. To counteract this, the person pulling on the wire must exert a force per unit charge fpull = uB to the right (Fig. 7.11). This force is transmitted to the charge by the structure of the wire. Meanwhile, the particle is actually moving in the direction of the resultant ve- locity w, and the distance it goes is (h/ cos θ ). The work done per unit charge is therefore √ fpull · dl = (uB) ( h cos θ ) sin θ = v Bh = E (sin θ coming from the dot product). As it turns out, then, the work done per unit charge is exactly equal to the emf, though the integrals are taken along entirely different paths (Fig. 7.12), and completely different forces are involved. To calcu- late the emf, you integrate around the loop at one instant, but to calculate the work done you follow a charge in its journey around the loop; fpull contributes nothing to the emf, because it is perpendicular to the wire, whereas fmag contributes nothing to work because it is perpendicular to the motion of the charge.6 There is a particularly nice way of expressing the emf generated in a moving loop. Let \u000b be the ﬂux of B through the loop: \u000b ≡ √ B · da. (7.12) θ θ fmag fpull u v w vB uB FIGURE 7.11 6For further discussion, see E. P. Mosca, Am.J.Phys. 42, 295 (1974). 7.1 Electromotive Force 307 b (a) Integration path for computing E (follow the wire at one instant of time). (b) Integration path for calculating work done (follow the charge around the loop). daa h/cos θ a′ d h a′ c b c FIGURE 7.12 For the rectangular loop in Fig. 7.10, \u000b = Bhx. As the loop moves, the ﬂux decreases: d\u000b dt = Bh dx dt =−Bhv. (The minus sign accounts for the fact that dx/dt is negative.) But this is precisely the emf (Eq. 7.11); evidently the emf generated in the loop is minus the rate of change of ﬂux through the loop: E =− d\u000b dt . (7.13) This is the ﬂux rule for motional emf. Apart from its delightful simplicity, the ﬂux rule has the virtue of applying to nonrectangular loops moving in arbitrary directions through nonuniform mag- netic ﬁelds; in fact, the loop need not even maintain a ﬁxed shape. Proof. Figure 7.13 shows a loop of wire at time t, and also a short time dt later. Suppose we compute the ﬂux at time t, using surface S, and the ﬂux at time t + dt, using the surface consisting of S plus the “ribbon” that connects the new position of the loop to the old. The change in ﬂux, then, is d\u000b = \u000b(t + dt) − \u000b(t) = \u000bribbon = √ ribbon B · da. Focus your attention on point P: in time dt,itmovesto P ′.Let v be the velocity of the wire, and u the velocity of a charge down the wire; w = v + u is the resultant 308 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Loop at time t Loop at time ( t + dt) Ribbon P P P′ P′ Surface S θ dl vdt Enlargement of da da FIGURE 7.13 velocity of a charge at P. The inﬁnitesimal element of area on the ribbon can be written as da = (v × dl) dt (see inset in Fig. 7.13). Therefore d\u000b dt = ∮ B · (v × dl). Since w = (v + u) and u is parallel to dl, we can just as well write this as d\u000b dt = ∮ B · (w × dl). Now, the scalar triple-product can be rewritten: B · (w × dl) =−(w × B) · dl, so d\u000b dt =− ∮ (w × B) · dl. But (w × B) is the magnetic force per unit charge, fmag,so d\u000b dt =− ∮ fmag · dl, and the integral of fmag is the emf: E =− d\u000b dt . □ There is a sign ambiguity in the deﬁnition of emf (Eq. 7.9): Which way around the loop are you supposed to integrate? There is a compensatory ambiguity in the deﬁnition of ﬂux (Eq. 7.12): Which is the positive direction for da? In applying 7.1 Electromotive Force 309 b a B (into page) A FIGURE 7.14 the ﬂux rule, sign consistency is governed (as always) by your right hand: If your ﬁngers deﬁne the positive direction around the loop, then your thumb indicates the direction of da. Should the emf come out negative, it means the current will ﬂow in the negative direction around the circuit. The ﬂux rule is a nifty short-cut for calculating motional emfs. It does not con- tain any new physics—just the Lorentz force law. But it can lead to error or ambi- guity if you’re not careful. The ﬂux rule assumes you have a single wire loop—it can move, rotate, stretch, or distort (continuously), but beware of switches, sliding contacts, or extended conductors allowing a variety of current paths. A standard “ﬂux rule paradox” involves the circuit in Figure 7.14. When the switch is thrown (from a to b) the ﬂux through the circuit doubles, but there’s no motional emf (no conductor moving through a magnetic ﬁeld), and the ammeter (A) records no current. Example 7.4. A metal disk of radius a rotates with angular velocity ω about a vertical axis, through a uniform ﬁeld B, pointing up. A circuit is made by connect- ing one end of a resistor to the axle and the other end to a sliding contact, which touches the outer edge of the disk (Fig. 7.15). Find the current in the resistor. I (Sliding contact) BB R FIGURE 7.15 Solution The speed of a point on the disk at a distance s from the axis is v = ωs,sothe force per unit charge is fmag = v × B = ωsBˆs. The emf is therefore E = √ a 0 fmag ds = ωB √ a 0 sds = ωBa2 2 , 310 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics and the current is I = E R = ωBa2 2R . Example 7.4 (the Faraday disk,or Faraday dynamo) involves a motional emf that you can’t calculate (at least, not directly) from the ﬂux rule. The ﬂux rule assumes the current ﬂows along a well-deﬁned path, whereas in this example the current spreads out over the whole disk. It’s not even clear what the “ﬂux through the circuit” would mean in this context. Even more tricky is the case of eddy currents. Take a chunk of aluminum (say), and shake it around in a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld. Currents will be gen- erated in the material, and you will feel a kind of “viscous drag”—as though you were pulling the block through molasses (this is the force I called fpull in the dis- cussion of motional emf). Eddy currents are notoriously difﬁcult to calculate, 7 but easy and dramatic to demonstrate. You may have witnessed the classic experiment in which an aluminum disk mounted as a pendulum on a horizontal axis swings down and passes between the poles of a magnet (Fig. 7.16a). When it enters the ﬁeld region it suddenly slows way down. To conﬁrm that eddy currents are re- sponsible, one repeats the demonstration using a disk that has many slots cut in it, to prevent the ﬂow of large-scale currents (Fig. 7.16b). This time the disk swings freely, unimpeded by the ﬁeld. (a) (b) FIGURE 7.16 Problem 7.7 Ametal barofmass m slides frictionlessly on two parallel conducting rails a distance l apart (Fig. 7.17). A resistor R is connected across the rails, and a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B, pointing into the page, ﬁlls the entire region. 7See, for example, W. M. Saslow, Am.J.Phys., 60, 693 (1992). 7.1 Electromotive Force 311 Rl m v FIGURE 7.17 (a) If the bar moves to the right at speed v, what is the current in the resistor? In what direction does it ﬂow? (b) What is the magnetic force on the bar? In what direction? (c) If the bar starts out with speed v0 at time t = 0, and is left to slide, what is its speed at a later time t? (d) The initial kinetic energy of the bar was, of course, 1 2 mv02. Check that the en- ergy delivered to the resistor is exactly 1 2 mv02. Problem 7.8 A square loop of wire (side a) lies on a table, a distance s from a very long straight wire, which carries a current I , as shown in Fig. 7.18. s a a I FIGURE 7.18 (a) Findthe ﬂuxof B through the loop. (b) If someone now pulls the loop directly away from the wire, at speed v,what emf is generated? In what direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) does the current ﬂow? (c) What if the loop is pulled to the right at speed v? Problem 7.9 An inﬁnite number of different surfaces can be ﬁt to a given boundary line, and yet, in deﬁning the magnetic ﬂux through a loop, \u000b = ∫ B · da,Inever speciﬁed the particular surface to be used. Justify this apparent oversight. Problem 7.10 A square loop (side a) is mounted on a vertical shaft and rotated at angular velocity ω (Fig. 7.19). A uniform magnetic ﬁeld B points to the right. Find the E(t) for this alternating current generator. Problem 7.11 A square loop is cut out of a thick sheet of aluminum. It is then placed so that the top portion is in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B, and is allowed to fall under gravity (Fig. 7.20). (In the diagram, shading indicates the ﬁeld region; B points into 312 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics the page.) If the magnetic ﬁeld is 1 T (a pretty standard laboratory ﬁeld), ﬁnd the terminal velocity of the loop (in m/s). Find the velocity of the loop as a function of time. How long does it take (in seconds) to reach, say, 90% of the terminal velocity? What would happen if you cut a tiny slit in the ring, breaking the circuit? [Note: The dimensions of the loop cancel out; determine the actual numbers, in the units indicated.] B a a ω FIGURE 7.19 FIGURE 7.20 7.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 7.2.1 Faraday’s Law In 1831 Michael Faraday reported on a series of experiments, including three that (with some violence to history) can be characterized as follows: Experiment 1. He pulled a loop of wire to the right through a magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 7.21a). A current ﬂowed in the loop. Experiment 2. He moved the magnet to the left, holding the loop still (Fig. 7.21b). Again, a current ﬂowed in the loop. Experiment 3. With both the loop and the magnet at rest (Fig. 7.21c), he changed the strength of the ﬁeld (he used an electromagnet, and varied the current in the coil). Once again, current ﬂowed in the loop. B (in) II B (in) I B (a) (b) (c) changing magnetic field vv FIGURE 7.21 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 313 The ﬁrst experiment, of course, is a straightforward case of motional emf; according to the ﬂux rule: E =− d\u000b dt . I don’t think it will surprise you to learn that exactly the same emf arises in Ex- periment 2—all that really matters is the relative motion of the magnet and the loop. Indeed, in the light of special relativity it has to be so. But Faraday knew nothing of relativity, and in classical electrodynamics this simple reciprocity is a remarkable coincidence. For if the loop moves, it’s a magnetic force that sets up the emf, but if the loop is stationary,the force cannot be magnetic—stationary charges experience no magnetic forces. In that case, what is responsible? What sort of ﬁeld exerts a force on charges at rest? Well, electric ﬁelds do, of course, but in this case there doesn’t seem to be any electric ﬁeld in sight. Faraday had an ingenious inspiration: A changing magnetic ﬁeld induces an electric ﬁeld. It is this induced 8 electric ﬁeld that accounts for the emf in Experiment 2.9 Indeed, if (as Faraday found empirically) the emf is again equal to the rate of change of the ﬂux, E = ∮ E · dl =− d\u000b dt , (7.14) then E is related to the change in B by the equation ∮ E · dl =− √ ∂B ∂t · da. (7.15) This is Faraday’s law, in integral form. We can convert it to differential form by applying Stokes’ theorem: ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t . (7.16) 8“Induce” is a subtle and slippery verb. It carries a faint odor of causation (“produce” would make this explicit) without quite committing itself. There is a sterile ongoing debate in the literature as to whether a changing magnetic ﬁeld should be regarded as an independent “source” of electric ﬁelds (along with electric charge)—after all, the magnetic ﬁeld itself is due to electric currents. It’s like asking whether the postman is the “source” of my mail. Well, sure—he delivered it to my door. On the other hand, Grandma wrote the letter. Ultimately, ρ and J are the sources of all electromagnetic ﬁelds, and a changing magnetic ﬁeld merely delivers electromagnetic news from currents elsewhere. But it is often convenient to think of a changing magnetic ﬁeld “producing” an electric ﬁeld, and it won’t hurt you as long as you understand that this is the condensed version of a more complicated story. For a nice discussion, see S. E. Hill, Phys. Teach. 48, 410 (2010). 9You might argue that the magnetic ﬁeld in Experiment 2 is not really changing—just moving.What I mean is that if you sit at a ﬁxed location, the ﬁeld you experience changes as the magnet passes by. 314 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Note that Faraday’s law reduces to the old rule ∮ E · dl = 0 (or, in differential form, ∇ × E = 0) in the static case (constant B) as, of course, it should. In Experiment 3, the magnetic ﬁeld changes for entirely different reasons, but according to Faraday’s law an electric ﬁeld will again be induced, giving rise to an emf −d\u000b/dt. Indeed, one can subsume all three cases (and for that matter any combination of them) into a kind of universal ﬂux rule: Whenever (and for whatever reason) the magnetic ﬂux through a loop changes, an emf E =− d\u000b dt (7.17) will appear in the loop. Many people call this “Faraday’s law.” Maybe I’m overly fastidious, but I ﬁnd this confusing. There are really two totally different mechanisms underlying Eq. 7.17, and to identify them both as “Faraday’s law” is a little like saying that because identical twins look alike we ought to call them by the same name. In Faraday’s ﬁrst experiment it’s the Lorentz force law at work; the emf is magnetic. But in the other two it’s an electric ﬁeld (induced by the changing magnetic ﬁeld) that does the job. Viewed in this light, it is quite astonishing that all three processes yield the same formula for the emf. In fact, it was precisely this “coincidence” that led Einstein to the special theory of relativity—he sought a deeper understanding of what is, in classical electrodynamics, a peculiar accident. But that’s a story for Chapter 12. In the meantime, I shall reserve the term “Faraday’s law” for electric ﬁelds induced by changing magnetic ﬁelds, and I do not regard Experiment 1 as an instance of Faraday’s law. Example 7.5. A long cylindrical magnet of length L and radius a carries a uni- form magnetization M parallel to its axis. It passes at constant velocity v through a circular wire ring of slightly larger diameter (Fig. 7.22). Graph the emf induced in the ring, as a function of time. L a M v FIGURE 7.22 Solution The magnetic ﬁeld is the same as that of a long solenoid with surface current Kb = M ˆφ. So the ﬁeld inside is B = μ0M, except near the ends, where it starts to spread out. The ﬂux through the ring is zero when the magnet is far away; it 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 315 buildsuptoamaximumof μ0 Mπa2 as the leading end passes through; and it drops back to zero as the trailing end emerges (Fig. 7.23a). The emf is (minus) the derivative of \u000b with respect to time, so it consists of two spikes, as shown in Fig. 7.23b. L/v t μ0Mπa2 φ t E (a) (b) FIGURE 7.23 Keeping track of the signs in Faraday’s law can be a real headache. For in- stance, in Ex. 7.5 we would like to know which way around the ring the induced current ﬂows. In principle, the right-hand rule does the job (we called \u000b positive to the left, in Fig. 7.22, so the positive direction for current in the ring is counter- clockwise, as viewed from the left; since the ﬁrst spike in Fig. 7.23b is negative, the ﬁrst current pulse ﬂows clockwise, and the second counterclockwise). But there’s a handy rule, called Lenz’s law, whose sole purpose is to help you get the directions right:10 Nature abhors a change in ﬂux. The induced current will ﬂow in such a direction that the ﬂux it produces tends to cancel the change. (As the front end of the magnet in Ex. 7.5 enters the ring, the ﬂux increases, so the current in the ring must generate a ﬁeld to the right—it therefore ﬂows clockwise.) Notice that it is the change in ﬂux, not the ﬂux it- self, that nature abhors (when the tail end of the magnet exits the ring, the ﬂux drops, so the induced current ﬂows counterclockwise, in an effort to restore it). Faraday induction is a kind of “inertial” phenomenon: A conducting loop “likes” to maintain a constant ﬂux through it; if you try to change the ﬂux, the loop re- sponds by sending a current around in such a direction as to frustrate your efforts. (It doesn’t succeed completely; the ﬂux produced by the induced current is typi- cally only a tiny fraction of the original. All Lenz’s law tells you is the direction of the ﬂow.) 10Lenz’s law applies to motional emfs, too, but for them it is usually easier to get the direction of the current from the Lorentz force law. 316 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Example 7.6. The “jumping ring” demonstration. If you wind a solenoidal coil around an iron core (the iron is there to beef up the magnetic ﬁeld), place a metal ring on top, and plug it in, the ring will jump several feet in the air (Fig. 7.24). Why? B ring solenoid FIGURE 7.24 Solution Before you turned on the current, the ﬂux through the ring was zero. Afterward a ﬂux appeared (upward, in the diagram), and the emf generated in the ring led to a current (in the ring) which, according to Lenz’s law, was in such a direction that its ﬁeld tended to cancel this new ﬂux. This means that the current in the loop is opposite to the current in the solenoid. And opposite currents repel, so the ring ﬂies off.11 Problem 7.12 A long solenoid, of radius a, is driven by an alternating current, so that the ﬁeld inside is sinusoidal: B(t) = B0 cos(ωt) ˆz. A circular loop of wire, of radius a/2 and resistance R, is placed inside the solenoid, and coaxial with it. Find the current induced in the loop, as a function of time. Problem 7.13 A square loop of wire, with sides of length a, lies in the ﬁrst quadrant of the xy plane, with one corner at the origin. In this region, there is a nonuniform time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld B(y, t) = ky3t 2 ˆz (where k is a constant). Find the emf induced in the loop. Problem 7.14 As a lecture demonstration a short cylindrical bar magnet is dropped down a vertical aluminum pipe of slightly larger diameter, about 2 meters long. It takes several seconds to emerge at the bottom, whereas an otherwise identical piece of unmagnetized iron makes the trip in a fraction of a second. Explain why the magnet falls more slowly.12 11For further discussion of the jumping ring (and the related “ﬂoating ring”), see C. S. Schneider and J. P. Ertel, Am. J. Phys. 66, 686 (1998); P. J. H. Tjossem and E. C. Brost, Am. J. Phys. 79, 353 (2011). 12For a discussion of this amazing demonstration see K. D. Hahn et al., Am.J.Phys. 66, 1066 (1998) and G. Donoso, C. L. Ladera, and P. Martin, Am. J. Phys. 79, 193 (2011). 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 317 7.2.2 The Induced Electric Field Faraday’s law generalizes the electrostatic rule ∇ × E = 0 to the time-dependent régime. The divergence of E is still given by Gauss’s law (∇ · E = 1 <0 ρ). If E is a pure Faraday ﬁeld (due exclusively to a changing B, with ρ = 0), then ∇ · E = 0, ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t . This is mathematically identical to magnetostatics, ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × B = μ0J. Conclusion: Faraday-induced electric ﬁelds are determined by −(∂B/∂t) in ex- actly the same way as magnetostatic ﬁelds are determined by μ0J. The analog to Biot-Savart is13 is E =− 1 4π √ (∂B/∂t) × ˆr r2 dτ =− 1 4π ∂ ∂t √ B × ˆr r2 dτ, (7.18) and if symmetry permits, we can use all the tricks associated with Ampère’s law in integral form (∮ B · dl = μ0 Ienc), only now it’s Faraday’s law in integral form: ∮ E · dl =− d\u000b dt . (7.19) The rate of change of (magnetic) ﬂux through the Amperian loop plays the role formerly assigned to μ0 Ienc. Example 7.7. A uniform magnetic ﬁeld B(t), pointing straight up, ﬁlls the shaded circular region of Fig. 7.25. If B is changing with time, what is the in- duced electric ﬁeld? Solution E points in the circumferential direction, just like the magnetic ﬁeld inside a long straight wire carrying a uniform current density. Draw an Amperian loop of radius s, and apply Faraday’s law: ∮ E · dl = E(2π s) =− d\u000b dt =− d dt ( π s2 B(t)) =−π s2 dB dt . Therefore E =− s 2 dB dt ˆφ. If B is increasing, E runs clockwise, as viewed from above. 13Magnetostatics holds only for time-independent currents, but there is no such restriction on ∂B/∂t. 318 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics B(t) Amperian loop s FIGURE 7.25 B0 E Rotation direction λ d l b a FIGURE 7.26 Example 7.8. A line charge λ is glued onto the rim of a wheel of radius b, which is then suspended horizontally, as shown in Fig. 7.26, so that it is free to rotate (the spokes are made of some nonconducting material—wood, maybe). In the central region, out to radius a, there is a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0, pointing up. Now someone turns the ﬁeld off. What happens? Solution The changing magnetic ﬁeld will induce an electric ﬁeld, curling around the axis of the wheel. This electric ﬁeld exerts a force on the charges at the rim, and the wheel starts to turn. According to Lenz’s law, it will rotate in such a direction that its ﬁeld tends to restore the upward ﬂux. The motion, then, is counterclockwise, as viewed from above. Faraday’s law, applied to the loop at radius b, says ∮ E · dl = E(2π b) =− d\u000b dt =−πa2 dB dt , or E =− a2 2b dB dt ˆφ. The torque on a segment of length dl is (r × F), or bλEdl. The total torque on the wheel is therefore N = bλ (− a2 2b dB dt ) ∮ dl =−bλπa2 dB dt , and the angular momentum imparted to the wheel is √ Ndt =−λπa2b √ 0 B0 dB = λπa2bB0. It doesn’t matter how quickly or slowly you turn off the ﬁeld; the resulting angular velocity of the wheel is the same regardless. (If you ﬁnd yourself wondering where the angular momentum came from, you’re getting ahead of the story! Wait for the next chapter.) Note that it’s the electric ﬁeld that did the rotating. To convince you of this, I deliberately set things up so that the magnetic ﬁeld is zero at the location of 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 319 the charge. The experimenter may tell you she never put in any electric ﬁeld—all she did was switch off the magnetic ﬁeld. But when she did that, an electric ﬁeld automatically appeared, and it’s this electric ﬁeld that turned the wheel. I must warn you, now, of a small fraud that tarnishes many applications of Faraday’s law: Electromagnetic induction, of course, occurs only when the mag- netic ﬁelds are changing, and yet we would like to use the apparatus of mag- netostatics (Ampère’s law, the Biot-Savart law, and the rest) to calculate those magnetic ﬁelds. Technically, any result derived in this way is only approximately correct. But in practice the error is usually negligible, unless the ﬁeld ﬂuctuates extremely rapidly, or you are interested in points very far from the source. Even the case of a wire snipped by a pair of scissors (Prob. 7.18) is static enough for Ampère’s law to apply. This régime, in which magnetostatic rules can be used to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld on the right hand side of Faraday’s law, is called quasistatic. Generally speaking, it is only when we come to electromagnetic waves and radiation that we must worry seriously about the breakdown of mag- netostatics itself. Example 7.9. An inﬁnitely long straight wire carries a slowly varying current I (t). Determine the induced electric ﬁeld, as a function of the distance s from the wire.14 l I s0 s Amperian loop FIGURE 7.27 Solution In the quasistatic approximation, the magnetic ﬁeld is (μ0 I /2π s), and it circles around the wire. Like the B-ﬁeld of a solenoid, E here runs parallel to the axis. For the rectangular “Amperian loop” in Fig. 7.27, Faraday’s law gives: ∮ E · dl = E(s0)l − E(s)l =− d dt √ B · da =− μ0l 2π dI dt √ s s0 1 s′ ds′ =− μ0l 2π dI dt (ln s − ln s0). 14This example is artiﬁcial, and not just in the obvious sense of involving inﬁnite wires, but in a more subtle respect. It assumes that the current is the same (at any given instant) all the way down the line. This is a safe assumption for the short wires in typical electric circuits, but not for long wires (transmission lines), unless you supply a distributed and synchronized driving mechanism. But never mind—the problem doesn’t inquire how you would produce such a current; it only asks what ﬁelds would result if you did. Variations on this problem are discussed by M. A. Heald, Am.J.Phys. 54, 1142 (1986). 320 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Thus E(s) = [ μ0 2π dI dt ln s + K ] ˆz, (7.20) where K is a constant (that is to say, it is independent of s—it might still be a function of t). The actual value of K depends on the whole history of the function I (t)—we’ll see some examples in Chapter 10. Equation 7.20 has the peculiar implication that E blows up as s goes to inﬁn- ity. That can’t be true . . . What’s gone wrong? Answer: We have overstepped the limits of the quasistatic approximation. As we shall see in Chapter 9, electromag- netic “news” travels at the speed of light, and at large distances B depends not on the current now, but on the current as it was at some earlier time (indeed, a whole range of earlier times, since different points on the wire are different dis- tances away). If τ is the time it takes I to change substantially, then the quasistatic approximation should hold only for s ≪ cτ, (7.21) and hence Eq. 7.20 simply does not apply, at extremely large s. Problem 7.15 A long solenoid with radius a and n turns per unit length carries a time-dependent current I (t) in the ˆφ direction. Find the electric ﬁeld (magnitude and direction) at a distance s from the axis (both inside and outside the solenoid), in the quasistatic approximation. Problem 7.16 An alternating current I = I0 cos (ωt) ﬂows down a long straight wire, and returns along a coaxial conducting tube of radius a. (a) In what direction does the induced electric ﬁeld point (radial, circumferential, or longitudinal)? (b) Assuming that the ﬁeld goes to zero as s →∞,ﬁnd E(s, t).15 Problem 7.17 A long solenoid of radius a, carrying n turns per unit length, is looped by a wire with resistance R, as shown in Fig. 7.28. R FIGURE 7.28 15This is not at all the way electric ﬁelds actually behave in coaxial cables, for reasons suggested in the previous footnote. See Sect. 9.5.3, or J. G. Cherveniak, Am.J.Phys., 54, 946 (1986), for a more realistic treatment. 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 321 (a) If the current in the solenoid is increasing at a constant rate (dI /dt = k), what current ﬂows in the loop, and which way (left or right) does it pass through the resistor? (b) If the current I in the solenoid is constant but the solenoid is pulled out of the loop (toward the left, to a place far from the loop), what total charge passes through the resistor? Problem 7.18 A square loop, side a, resistance R, lies a distance s from an inﬁnite straight wire that carries current I (Fig. 7.29). Now someone cuts the wire, so I drops to zero. In what direction does the induced current in the square loop ﬂow, and what total charge passes a given point in the loop during the time this current ﬂows? If you don’t like the scissors model, turn the current down gradually: I (t) = { (1 − αt)I, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/α, 0, for t > 1/α. a a s I FIGURE 7.29 Problem 7.19 A toroidal coil has a rectangular cross section, with inner radius a, outer radius a + w, and height h. It carries a total of N tightly wound turns, and the current is increasing at a constant rate (dI /dt = k). If w and h are both much less than a, ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld at a point z above the center of the toroid. [Hint: Exploit the analogy between Faraday ﬁelds and magnetostatic ﬁelds, and refer to Ex. 5.6.] Problem 7.20 Where is ∂B/∂t nonzero, in Figure 7.21(b)? Exploit the analogy between Faraday’s law and Ampère’s law to sketch (qualitatively) the electric ﬁeld. Problem 7.21 Imagine a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, pointing in the z direction and ﬁlling all space (B = B0 ˆz). A positive charge is at rest, at the origin. Now somebody turns off the magnetic ﬁeld, thereby inducing an electric ﬁeld. In what direction does thechargemove? 16 7.2.3 Inductance Suppose you have two loops of wire, at rest (Fig. 7.30). If you run a steady current I1 around loop 1, it produces a magnetic ﬁeld B1. Some of the ﬁeld lines pass 16This paradox was suggested by Tom Colbert. Refer to Problem 2.55. 322 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Loop 2 Loop 1 B1 B1 I1 B1 FIGURE 7.30 Loop 2 Loop 1 r dl2 d l1 FIGURE 7.31 through loop 2; let \u000b2 be the ﬂux of B1 through 2. You might have a tough time actually calculating B1, but a glance at the Biot-Savart law, B1 = μ0 4π I1 ∮ dl1 × ˆr r2 , reveals one signiﬁcant fact about this ﬁeld: It is proportional to the current I1. Therefore, so too is the ﬂux through loop 2: \u000b2 = √ B1 · da2. Thus \u000b2 = M21 I1, (7.22) where M21 is the constant of proportionality; it is known as the mutual induc- tance of the two loops. There is a cute formula for the mutual inductance, which you can derive by expressing the ﬂux in terms of the vector potential, and invoking Stokes’ theorem: \u000b2 = √ B1 · da2 = √ (∇ × A1) · da2 = ∮ A1 · dl2. Now, according to Eq. 5.66, A1 = μ0 I1 4π ∮ dl1 r , and hence \u000b2 = μ0 I1 4π ∮ (∮ dl1 r ) · dl2. Evidently M21 = μ0 4π ∮∮ dl1 · dl2 r . (7.23) 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 323 This is the Neumann formula; it involves a double line integral—one integration around loop 1, the other around loop 2 (Fig. 7.31). It’s not very useful for practical calculations, but it does reveal two important things about mutual inductance: 1. M21 is a purely geometrical quantity, having to do with the sizes, shapes, and relative positions of the two loops. 2. The integral in Eq. 7.23 is unchanged if we switch the roles of loops 1 and 2; it follows that M21 = M12. (7.24) This is an astonishing conclusion: Whatever the shapes and positions of the loops, the ﬂux through 2 when we run a current I around 1 is identical to the ﬂux through 1 when we send the same current I around 2. We may as well drop the subscripts and call them both M. Example 7.10. A short solenoid (length l and radius a, with n1 turns per unit length) lies on the axis of a very long solenoid (radius b, n2 turns per unit length) as shown in Fig. 7.32. Current I ﬂows in the short solenoid. What is the ﬂux through the long solenoid? l b a FIGURE 7.32 Solution Since the inner solenoid is short, it has a very complicated ﬁeld; moreover, it puts a different ﬂux through each turn of the outer solenoid. It would be a miserable task to compute the total ﬂux this way. However, if we exploit the equality of the mutual inductances, the problem becomes very easy. Just look at the reverse situ- ation: run the current I through the outer solenoid, and calculate the ﬂux through the inner one. The ﬁeld inside the long solenoid is constant: B = μ0n2 I (Eq. 5.59), so the ﬂux through a single loop of the short solenoid is Bπa2 = μ0n2 I πa2. There are n1l turns in all, so the total ﬂux through the inner solenoid is \u000b = μ0πa2n1n2lI. 324 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics This is also the ﬂux a current I in the short solenoid would put through the long one, which is what we set out to ﬁnd. Incidentally, the mutual inductance, in this case, is M = μ0πa2n1n2l. Suppose, now, that you vary the current in loop 1. The ﬂux through loop 2 will vary accordingly, and Faraday’s law says this changing ﬂux will induce an emf in loop 2: E2 =− d\u000b2 dt =−M dI1 dt . (7.25) (In quoting Eq. 7.22—which was based on the Biot-Savart law—I am tacitly assuming that the currents change slowly enough for the system to be consid- ered quasistatic.) What a remarkable thing: Every time you change the current in loop 1, an induced current ﬂows in loop 2—even though there are no wires connecting them! Come to think of it, a changing current not only induces an emf in any nearby loops, it also induces an emf in the source loop itself (Fig 7.33). Once again, the ﬁeld (and therefore also the ﬂux) is proportional to the current: \u000b = LI. (7.26) The constant of proportionality L is called the self inductance (or simply the inductance) of the loop. As with M, it depends on the geometry (size and shape) of the loop. If the current changes, the emf induced in the loop is E =−L dI dt . (7.27) Inductance is measured in henries (H); a henry is a volt-second per ampere. B B I FIGURE 7.33 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 325 Example 7.11. Find the self-inductance of a toroidal coil with rectangular cross section (inner radius a, outer radius b, height h), that carries a total of N turns. Solution The magnetic ﬁeld inside the toroid is (Eq. 5.60) B = μ0 NI 2π s . a s b h ds Axis FIGURE 7.34 The ﬂux through a single turn (Fig. 7.34) is √ B · da = μ0 NI 2π h √ b a 1 s ds = μ0 NI h 2π ln ( b a ) . The total ﬂux is N times this, so the self-inductance (Eq. 7.26) is L = μ0 N 2h 2π ln ( b a ) . (7.28) Inductance (like capacitance) is an intrinsically positive quantity. Lenz’s law, which is enforced by the minus sign in Eq. 7.27, dictates that the emf is in such a direction as to oppose any change in current. For this reason, it is called a back emf. Whenever you try to alter the current in a wire, you must ﬁght against this back emf. Inductance plays somewhat the same role in electric circuits that mass plays in mechanical systems: The greater L is, the harder it is to change the current, just as the larger the mass, the harder it is to change an object’s velocity. Example 7.12. Suppose a current I is ﬂowing around a loop, when someone suddenly cuts the wire. The current drops “instantaneously” to zero. This gen- erates a whopping back emf, for although I maybesmall, dI /dt is enormous. (That’s why you sometimes draw a spark when you unplug an iron or toaster— electromagnetic induction is desperately trying to keep the current going, even if it has to jump the gap in the circuit.) Nothing so dramatic occurs when you plug in a toaster or iron. In this case in- duction opposes the sudden increase in current, prescribing instead a smooth and 326 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics continuous buildup. Suppose, for instance, that a battery (which supplies a con- stant emf E0) is connected to a circuit of resistance R and inductance L (Fig. 7.35). What current ﬂows? R L ε0 FIGURE 7.35 Solution The total emf in this circuit is E0 from the battery plus −L(dI /dt) from the in- ductance. Ohm’s law, then, says17 E0 − L dI dt = IR. This is a ﬁrst-order differential equation for I as a function of time. The general solution, as you can show for yourself, is I (t) = E0 R + ke−(R/L)t , where k is a constant to be determined by the initial conditions. In particular, if you close the switch at time t = 0, so I (0) = 0, then k =−E0/R, and I (t) = E0 R [ 1 − e−(R/L)t ] . (7.29) This function is plotted in Fig. 7.36. Had there been no inductance in the circuit, the current would have jumped immediately to E0/R. In practice, every circuit has some self-inductance, and the current approaches E0/R asymptotically. The quantity τ ≡ L/R is the time constant; it tells you how long the current takes to reach a substantial fraction (roughly two-thirds) of its ﬁnal value. L /R 2L /R 3L/R I t E0/R FIGURE 7.36 17Notice that −L(dI /dt) goes on the left side of the equation—it is part of the emf that establishes the voltage across the resistor. 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 327 Problem 7.22 A small loop of wire (radius a) is held a distance z above the center of a large loop (radius b), as shown in Fig. 7.37. The planes of the two loops are parallel, and perpendicular to the common axis. (a) Suppose current I ﬂows in the big loop. Find the ﬂux through the little loop. (The little loop is so small that you may consider the ﬁeld of the big loop to be essentially constant.) (b) Suppose current I ﬂows in the little loop. Find the ﬂux through the big loop. (The little loop is so small that you may treat it as a magnetic dipole.) (c) Find the mutual inductances, and conﬁrm that M12 = M21. Problem 7.23 A square loop of wire, of side a, lies midway between two long wires, 3a apart, and in the same plane. (Actually, the long wires are sides of a large rectan- gular loop, but the short ends are so far away that they can be neglected.) A clock- wise current I in the square loop is gradually increasing: dI /dt = k (a constant). Find the emf induced in the big loop. Which way will the induced current ﬂow? Problem 7.24 Find the self-inductance per unit length of a long solenoid, of radius R, carrying n turns per unit length. a z b FIGURE 7.37 d l FIGURE 7.38 Problem 7.25 Try to compute the self-inductance of the “hairpin” loop shown in Fig. 7.38. (Neglect the contribution from the ends; most of the ﬂux comes from the long straight section.) You’ll run into a snag that is characteristic of many self- inductance calculations. To get a deﬁnite answer, assume the wire has a tiny radius <, and ignore any ﬂux through the wire itself. Problem 7.26 An alternating current I (t) = I0 cos(ωt) (amplitude 0.5 A, frequency 60 Hz) ﬂows down a straight wire, which runs along the axis of a toroidal coil with rectangular cross section (inner radius 1 cm, outer radius 2 cm, height 1 cm, 1000 turns). The coil is connected to a 500 \u0007 resistor. (a) In the quasistatic approximation, what emf is induced in the toroid? Find the current, IR(t), in the resistor. (b) Calculate the back emf in the coil, due to the current IR(t). What is the ratio of the amplitudes of this back emf and the “direct” emf in (a)? Problem 7.27 A capacitor C is charged up to a voltage V and connected to an inductor L, as shown schematically in Fig. 7.39. At time t = 0, the switch S is closed. Find the current in the circuit as a function of time. How does your answer change if a resistor R is included in series with C and L? 328 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics CL S FIGURE 7.39 7.2.4 Energy in Magnetic Fields It takes a certain amount of energy to start a current ﬂowing in a circuit. I’m not talking about the energy delivered to the resistors and converted into heat—that is irretrievably lost, as far as the circuit is concerned, and can be large or small, depending on how long you let the current run. What I am concerned with, rather, is the work you must do against the back emf to get the current going. This is a ﬁxed amount, and it is recoverable: you get it back when the current is turned off. In the meantime, it represents energy latent in the circuit; as we’ll see in a moment, it can be regarded as energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld. The work done on a unit charge, against the back emf, in one trip around the circuit is −E (the minus sign records the fact that this is the work done by you against the emf, not the work done by the emf). The amount of charge per unit time passing down the wire is I . So the total work done per unit time is dW dt =−E I = LI dI dt . If we start with zero current and build it up to a ﬁnal value I , the work done (integrating the last equation over time) is W = 1 2 LI 2. (7.30) It does not depend on how long we take to crank up the current, only on the geometry of the loop (in the form of L) and the ﬁnal current I . There is a nicer way to write W , which has the advantage that it is readily generalized to surface and volume currents. Remember that the ﬂux \u000b through the loop is equal to LI (Eq. 7.26). On the other hand, \u000b = √ B · da = √ (∇ × A) · da = ∮ A · dl, where the line integral is around the perimeter of the loop. Thus LI = ∮ A · dl, 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 329 and therefore W = 1 2 I ∮ A · dl = 1 2 ∮ (A · I) dl. (7.31) In this form, the generalization to volume currents is obvious: W = 1 2 √ V (A · J) dτ. (7.32) But we can do even better, and express W entirely in terms of the magnetic ﬁeld: Ampère’s law, ∇ × B = μ0J, lets us eliminate J: W = 1 2μ0 √ A · (∇ × B) dτ. (7.33) Integration by parts transfers the derivative from B to A; speciﬁcally, product rule 6 states that ∇ · (A × B) = B · (∇ × A) − A · (∇ × B), so A · (∇ × B) = B · B − ∇ · (A × B). Consequently, W = 1 2μ0 [√ B2 dτ − √ ∇ · (A × B) dτ ] = 1 2μ0 [√ V B2 dτ − ∮ S (A × B) · da ] , (7.34) where S is the surface bounding the volume V. Now, the integration in Eq. 7.32 is to be taken over the entire volume occupied by the current. But any region larger than this will do just as well, for J is zero out there anyway. In Eq. 7.34, the larger the region we pick the greater is the contribution from the volume integral, and therefore the smaller is that of the surface integral (this makes sense: as the surface gets farther from the current, both A and B decrease). In particular, if we agree to integrate over all space, then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with W = 1 2μ0 √ all space B2 dτ . (7.35) In view of this result, we say the energy is “stored in the magnetic ﬁeld,” in the amount (B2/2μ0) per unit volume. This is a nice way to think of it, though someone looking at Eq. 7.32 might prefer to say that the energy is stored in the current distribution, in the amount 1 2 (A · J) per unit volume. The distinction is one of bookkeeping; the important quantity is the total energy W , and we need not worry about where (if anywhere) the energy is “located.” 330 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics You might ﬁnd it strange that it takes energy to set up a magnetic ﬁeld—after all, magnetic ﬁelds themselves do no work. The point is that producing a magnetic ﬁeld, where previously there was none, requires changing the ﬁeld, and a chang- ing B-ﬁeld, according to Faraday, induces an electric ﬁeld. The latter, of course, can do work. In the beginning, there is no E, and at the end there is no E;but in between, while B is building up, there is an E, and it is against this that the work is done. (You see why I could not calculate the energy stored in a magnetostatic ﬁeld back in Chapter 5.) In the light of this, it is extraordinary how similar the magnetic energy formulas are to their electrostatic counterparts: 18 Welec = 1 2 √ (Vρ) dτ = <0 2 √ E 2 dτ, (2.43 and 2.45) Wmag = 1 2 √ (A · J) dτ = 1 2μ0 √ B2 dτ. (7.32 and 7.35) Example 7.13. A long coaxial cable carries current I (the current ﬂows down the surface of the inner cylinder, radius a, and back along the outer cylinder, radius b) as shown in Fig. 7.40. Find the magnetic energy stored in a section of length l. I a b I FIGURE 7.40 Solution According to Ampère’s law, the ﬁeld between the cylinders is B = μ0 I 2π s ˆφ. Elsewhere, the ﬁeld is zero. Thus, the energy per unit volume is 1 2μ0 ( μ0 I 2π s )2 = μ0 I 2 8π 2s2 . The energy in a cylindrical shell of length l, radius s, and thickness ds, then, is ( μ0 I 2 8π 2s2 ) 2πls ds = μ0 I 2l 4π ( ds s ) . 18For an illuminating conﬁrmation of Eq. 7.35, using the method of Prob. 2.44, see T. H. Boyer, Am.J.Phys. 69, 1 (2001). 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 331 Integrating from a to b,wehave: W = μ0 I 2l 4π ln ( b a ) . By the way, this suggests a very simple way to calculate the self-inductance of the cable. According to Eq. 7.30, the energy can also be written as 1 2 LI 2.Com- paring the two expressions,19 L = μ0l 2π ln ( b a ) . This method of calculating self-inductance is especially useful when the current is not conﬁned to a single path, but spreads over some surface or volume, so that different parts of the current enclose different amounts of ﬂux. In such cases, it can be very tricky to get the inductance directly from Eq. 7.26, and it is best to let Eq. 7.30 deﬁne L. Problem 7.28 Find theenergystoredinasectionoflength l of a long solenoid (radius R, current I , n turns per unit length), (a) using Eq. 7.30 (you found L in Prob. 7.24); (b) using Eq. 7.31 (we worked out A in Ex. 5.12); (c) using Eq. 7.35; (d) using Eq. 7.34 (take as your volume the cylindrical tube from radius a < R out to radius b > R). Problem 7.29 Calculate the energy stored in the toroidal coil of Ex. 7.11, by apply- ing Eq. 7.35. Use the answer to check Eq. 7.28. Problem 7.30 A long cable carries current in one direction uniformly distributed over its (circular) cross section. The current returns along the surface (there is a very thin insulating sheath separating the currents). Find the self-inductance per unit length. Problem 7.31 Suppose the circuit in Fig. 7.41 has been connected for a long time when suddenly, at time t = 0, switch S is thrown from A to B, bypassing the battery. R L S ε0 A B FIGURE 7.41 19Notice the similarity to Eq. 7.28—in a sense, the rectangular toroid is a short coaxial cable, turned on its side. 332 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics (a) What is the current at any subsequent time t? (b) What is the total energy delivered to the resistor? (c) Show that this is equal to the energy originally stored in the inductor. Problem 7.32 Two tiny wire loops, with areas a1 and a2, are situated a displacement r apart (Fig. 7.42). a2 a1 r FIGURE 7.42 (a) Find their mutual inductance. [Hint: Treat them as magnetic dipoles, and use Eq. 5.88.] Is your formula consistent with Eq. 7.24? (b) Suppose a current I1 is ﬂowing in loop 1, and we propose to turn on a current I2 in loop 2. How much work must be done, against the mutually induced emf, to keep the current I1 ﬂowing in loop 1? In light of this result, comment on Eq. 6.35. Problem 7.33 An inﬁnite cylinder of radius R carries a uniform surface charge σ . We propose to set it spinning about its axis, at a ﬁnal angular velocity ω f . How much work will this take, per unit length? Do it two ways, and compare your answers: (a) Find the magnetic ﬁeld and the induced electric ﬁeld (in the quasistatic approx- imation), inside and outside the cylinder, in terms of ω, ˙ω,and s (the distance from the axis). Calculate the torque you must exert, and from that obtain the work done per unit length (W = ∫ Ndφ). (b) Use Eq. 7.35 to determine the energy stored in the resulting magnetic ﬁeld. 7.3 MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 7.3.1 Electrodynamics Before Maxwell So far, we have encountered the following laws, specifying the divergence and curl of electric and magnetic ﬁelds: (i) ∇ · E = 1 <0 ρ (Gauss’s law), (ii) ∇ · B = 0 (no name), (iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t (Faraday’s law), (iv) ∇ × B = μ0J (Ampère’s law). 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 333 These equations represent the state of electromagnetic theory in the mid-nineteenth century, when Maxwell began his work. They were not written in so compact a form, in those days, but their physical content was familiar. Now, it happens that there is a fatal inconsistency in these formulas. It has to do with the old rule that divergence of curl is always zero. If you apply the divergence to number (iii), everything works out: ∇ · (∇ × E) = ∇ · ( − ∂B ∂t ) =− ∂ ∂t (∇ · B). The left side is zero because divergence of curl is zero; the right side is zero by virtue of equation (ii). But when you do the same thing to number (iv), you get into trouble: ∇ · (∇ × B) = μ0(∇ · J); (7.36) the left side must be zero, but the right side, in general, is not.For steady currents, the divergence of J is zero, but when we go beyond magnetostatics Ampère’s law cannot be right. There’s another way to see that Ampère’s law is bound to fail for nonsteady currents. Suppose we’re in the process of charging up a capacitor (Fig. 7.43). In integral form, Ampère’s law reads ∮ B · dl = μ0 Ienc. I want to apply it to the Amperian loop shown in the diagram. How do I deter- mine Ienc? Well, it’s the total current passing through the loop, or, more precisely, the current piercing a surface that has the loop for its boundary. In this case, the simplest surface lies in the plane of the loop—the wire punctures this surface, so Ienc = I . Fine—but what if I draw instead the balloon-shaped surface in Fig. 7.43? No current passes through this surface, and I conclude that Ienc = 0! We never had this problem in magnetostatics because the conﬂict arises only when charge Capacitor Battery Amperian loop I FIGURE 7.43 334 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics is piling up somewhere (in this case, on the capacitor plates). But for nonsteady currents (such as this one) “the current enclosed by the loop” is an ill-deﬁned notion; it depends entirely on what surface you use. (If this seems pedantic to you—“obviously one should use the plane surface”—remember that the Ampe- rian loop could be some contorted shape that doesn’t even lie in a plane.) Of course, we had no right to expect Ampère’s law to hold outside of magne- tostatics; after all, we derived it from the Biot-Savart law. However, in Maxwell’s time there was no experimental reason to doubt that Ampère’s law was of wider validity. The ﬂaw was a purely theoretical one, and Maxwell ﬁxed it by purely theoretical arguments. 7.3.2 How Maxwell Fixed Ampère’s Law The problem is on the right side of Eq. 7.36, which should be zero, but isn’t. Applying the continuity equation (5.29) and Gauss’s law, the offending term can be rewritten: ∇ · J =− ∂ρ ∂t =− ∂ ∂t (<0∇ · E) =−∇ · ( <0 ∂E ∂t ) . If we were to combine <0(∂E/∂t) with J, in Ampère’s law, it would be just right to kill off the extra divergence: ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0<0 ∂E ∂t . (7.37) (Maxwell himself had other reasons for wanting to add this quantity to Ampère’s law. To him, the rescue of the continuity equation was a happy dividend rather than a primary motive. But today we recognize this argument as a far more compelling one than Maxwell’s, which was based on a now-discredited model of the ether.)20 Such a modiﬁcation changes nothing, as far as magnetostatics is concerned: when E is constant, we still have ∇ × B = μ0J. In fact, Maxwell’s term is hard to detect in ordinary electromagnetic experiments, where it must compete for at- tention with J—that’s why Faraday and the others never discovered it in the lab- oratory. However, it plays a crucial role in the propagation of electromagnetic waves, as we’ll see in Chapter 9. Apart from curing the defect in Ampère’s law, Maxwell’s term has a cer- tain aesthetic appeal: Just as a changing magnetic ﬁeld induces an electric ﬁeld (Faraday’s law), so 21 A changing electric ﬁeld induces a magnetic ﬁeld. 20For the history of this subject, see A. M. Bork, Am. J. Phys. 31, 854 (1963). 21See footnote 8 (page 313) for commentary on the word “induce.” The same issue arises here: Should a changing electric ﬁeld be regarded as an independent source of magnetic ﬁeld (along with current)? In a proximate sense it does function as a source, but since the electric ﬁeld itself was produced by charges and currents, they alone are the “ultimate” sources of E and B. See S. E. Hill, Phys. Teach. 49, 343 (2011); for a contrary view, see C. Savage, Phys. Teach. 50, 226 (2012). 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 335 Of course, theoretical convenience and aesthetic consistency are only suggestive— there might, after all, be other ways to doctor up Ampère’s law. The real conﬁr- mation of Maxwell’s theory came in 1888 with Hertz’s experiments on electro- magnetic waves. Maxwell called his extra term the displacement current: Jd ≡ <0 ∂E ∂t . (7.38) (It’s a misleading name; <0(∂E/∂t) has nothing to do with current, except that it adds to J in Ampère’s law.) Let’s see now how displacement current resolves the paradox of the charging capacitor (Fig. 7.43). If the capacitor plates are very close together (I didn’t draw them that way, but the calculation is simpler if you assume this), then the electric ﬁeld between them is E = 1 <0 σ = 1 <0 Q A , where Q is the charge on the plate and A is its area. Thus, between the plates ∂ E ∂t = 1 <0 A dQ dt = 1 <0 A I. Now, Eq. 7.37 reads, in integral form, ∮ B · dl = μ0 Ienc + μ0<0 √ ( ∂E ∂t ) · da. (7.39) If we choose the ﬂat surface, then E = 0 and Ienc = I . If, on the other hand, we use the balloon-shaped surface, then Ienc = 0, but ∫ (∂E/∂t) · da = I /<0.Sowe get the same answer for either surface, though in the ﬁrst case it comes from the conduction current, and in the second from the displacement current. Example 7.14. Imagine two concentric metal spherical shells (Fig. 7.44). The inner one (radius a) carries a charge Q(t), and the outer one (radius b)an opposite charge −Q(t). The space between them is ﬁlled with Ohmic material of conductivity σ , so a radial current ﬂows: J = σ E = σ 1 4π<0 Q r 2 ˆr; I =− ˙Q = √ J · da = σ Q <0 . This conﬁguration is spherically symmetrical, so the magnetic ﬁeld has to be zero (the only direction it could possibly point is radial, and ∇ · B = 0 ⇒ ∮ B · da = B(4πr 2) = 0, so B = 0). What? I thought currents produce magnetic ﬁelds! Isn’t that what Biot-Savart and Ampère taught us? How can there be a J with no accompanying B? 336 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics J a b FIGURE 7.44 Solution This is not a static conﬁguration: Q, E, and J are all functions of time; Ampère and Biot-Savart do not apply. The displacement current Jd = <0 ∂E ∂t = 1 4π ˙Q r 2 ˆr =−σ Q 4π<0r 2 ˆr exactly cancels the conduction current (in Eq. 7.37), and the magnetic ﬁeld (determined by ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × B = 0) is indeed zero. Problem 7.34 A fat wire, radius a, carries a constant current I , uniformly dis- tributed over its cross section. A narrow gap in the wire, of width w ≪ a, forms a parallel-plate capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.45. Find the magnetic ﬁeld in the gap, at a distance s < a from the axis. a I I +σ −σ w FIGURE 7.45 Problem 7.35 The preceding problem was an artiﬁcial model for the charging ca- pacitor, designed to avoid complications associated with the current spreading out over the surface of the plates. For a more realistic model, imagine thin wires that connect to the centers of the plates (Fig. 7.46a). Again, the current I is constant, the radius of the capacitor is a, and the separation of the plates is w ≪ a. Assume that the current ﬂows out over the plates in such a way that the surface charge is uniform, at any given time, and is zero at t = 0. (a) Find the electric ﬁeld between the plates, as a function of t. (b) Find the displacement current through a circle of radius s in the plane mid- way between the plates. Using this circle as your “Amperian loop,” and the ﬂat surface that spans it, ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld at a distance s from the axis. 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 337 II w II (a) (b) s FIGURE 7.46 (c) Repeat part (b), but this time use the cylindrical surface in Fig. 7.46(b), which is open at the right end and extends to the left through the plate and terminates outside the capacitor. Notice that the displacement current through this surface is zero, and there are two contributions to Ienc. 22 Problem 7.36 Refer to Prob. 7.16, to which the correct answer was E(s, t) = μ0 I0ω 2π sin(ωt) ln ( a s ) ˆz. (a) Find the displacement current density Jd . (b) Integrate it to get the total displacement current, Id = √ Jd · da. (c) Compare Id and I . (What’s their ratio?) If the outer cylinder were, say, 2 mm in diameter, how high would the frequency have to be, for Id to be 1% of I ?[This problem is designed to indicate why Faraday never discovered displacement currents, and why it is ordinarily safe to ignore them unless the frequency is extremely high.] 7.3.3 Maxwell’s Equations In the last section we put the ﬁnishing touches on Maxwell’s equations: (i) ∇ · E = 1 <0 ρ (Gauss’s law), (ii) ∇ · B = 0 (no name), (iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t (Faraday’s law), (iv) ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0<0 ∂E ∂t (Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s correction). (7.40) 22This problem raises an interesting quasi-philosophical question: If you measure B in the laboratory, have you detected the effects of displacement current (as (b) would suggest), or merely conﬁrmed the effects of ordinary currents (as (c) implies)? See D. F. Bartlett, Am. J. Phys. 58, 1168 (1990). 338 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Together with the force law, F = q(E + v × B), (7.41) they summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics23 (save for some special properties of matter, which we encountered in Chapters 4 and 6). Even the continuity equation, ∇ · J =− ∂ρ ∂t , (7.42) which is the mathematical expression of conservation of charge, can be derived from Maxwell’s equations by applying the divergence to number (iv). I have written Maxwell’s equations in the traditional way, which emphasizes that they specify the divergence and curl of E and B. In this form, they reinforce the notion that electric ﬁelds can be produced either by charges (ρ) or by changing magnetic ﬁelds (∂B/∂t), and magnetic ﬁelds can be produced either by currents (J) or by changing electric ﬁelds (∂E/∂t). Actually, this is misleading, because ∂B/∂t and ∂E/∂t are themselves due to charges and currents. I think it is logically preferable to write (i) ∇ · E = 1 <0 ρ, (iii) ∇ × E + ∂B ∂t = 0, (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × B − μ0<0 ∂E ∂t = μ0J, ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎭ (7.43) with the ﬁelds (E and B) on the left and the sources (ρ and J) on the right. This notation emphasizes that all electromagnetic ﬁelds are ultimately attributable to charges and currents. Maxwell’s equations tell you how charges produce ﬁelds; reciprocally, the force law tells you how ﬁelds affect charges. Problem 7.37 Suppose E(r, t) = 1 4π<0 q r 2 θ(vt − r )ˆr; B(r, t) = 0 (The theta function is deﬁned in Prob. 1.46b). Show that these ﬁelds satisfy all of Maxwell’s equations, and determine ρ and J. Describe the physical situation that gives rise to these ﬁelds. 7.3.4 Magnetic Charge There is a pleasing symmetry to Maxwell’s equations; it is particularly striking in free space, where ρ and J vanish: ∇ · E = 0, ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × B = μ0<0 ∂E ∂t . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ 23Like any differential equations, Maxwell’s must be supplemented by suitable boundary conditions. Because these are typically “obvious” from the context (e.g. E and B go to zero at large distances from a localized charge distribution), it is easy to forget that they play an essential role. 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 339 If you replace E by B and B by −μ0<0E, the ﬁrst pair of equations turns into the second, and vice versa. This symmetry24 between E and B is spoiled, though, by the charge term in Gauss’s law and the current term in Ampère’s law. You can’t help wondering why the corresponding quantities are “missing” from ∇ · B = 0 and ∇ × E =−∂B/∂t. What if we had (i) ∇ · E = 1 <0 ρe,(iii) ∇ × E =−μ0Jm − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = μ0ρm,(iv) ∇ × B = μ0Je + μ0<0 ∂E ∂t . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (7.44) Then ρm would represent the density of magnetic “charge,” and ρe the density of electric charge; Jm would be the current of magnetic charge, and Je the current of electric charge. Both charges would be conserved: ∇ · Jm =− ∂ρm ∂t , and ∇ · Je =− ∂ρe ∂t . (7.45) The former follows by application of the divergence to (iii), the latter by taking the divergence of (iv). In a sense, Maxwell’s equations beg for magnetic charge to exist—it would ﬁt in so nicely. And yet, in spite of a diligent search, no one has ever found any.25 As far as we know, ρm is zero everywhere, and so is Jm; B is not on equal foot- ing with E: there exist stationary sources for E (electric charges) but none for B. (This is reﬂected in the fact that magnetic multipole expansions have no monopole term, and magnetic dipoles consist of current loops, not separated north and south “poles.”) Apparently God just didn’t make any magnetic charge. (In quantum elec- trodynamics, by the way, it’s a more than merely aesthetic shame that magnetic charge does not seem to exist: Dirac showed that the existence of magnetic charge would explain why electric charge is quantized. See Prob. 8.19.) Problem 7.38 Assuming that “Coulomb’s law” for magnetic charges (qm)reads F = μ0 4π qm1 qm2 r2 ˆr, (7.46) work out the force law for a monopole qm moving with velocity v through electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B.26 Problem 7.39 Suppose a magnetic monopole qm passes through a resistanceless loop of wire with self-inductance L. What current is induced in the loop? 27 24Don’t be distracted by the pesky constants μ0 and <0; these are present only because the SI system measures E and B in different units, and would not occur, for instance, in the Gaussian system. 25For an extensive bibliography, see A. S. Goldhaber and W. P. Trower, Am.J.Phys. 58, 429 (1990). 26For interesting commentary, see W. Rindler, Am.J.Phys. 57, 993 (1989). 27This is one of the methods used to search for monopoles in the laboratory; see B. Cabrera, Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1378 (1982). 340 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics 7.3.5 Maxwell’s Equations in Matter Maxwell’s equations in the form 7.40 are complete and correct as they stand. However, when you are working with materials that are subject to electric and magnetic polarization there is a more convenient way to write them. For inside polarized matter there will be accumulations of “bound” charge and current, over which you exert no direct control. It would be nice to reformulate Maxwell’s equations so as to make explicit reference only to the “free” charges and currents. We have already learned, from the static case, that an electric polarization P produces a bound charge density ρb =−∇ · P (7.47) (Eq. 4.12). Likewise, a magnetic polarization (or “magnetization”) M results in a bound current Jb = ∇ × M (7.48) (Eq. 6.13). There’s just one new feature to consider in the nonstatic case: Any change in the electric polarization involves a ﬂow of (bound) charge (call it J p), which must be included in the total current. For suppose we examine a tiny chunk of polarized material (Fig. 7.47). The polarization introduces a charge density σb = P at one end and −σb at the other (Eq. 4.11). If P now increases a bit, the charge on each end increases accordingly, giving a net current dI = ∂σb ∂t da⊥ = ∂ P ∂t da⊥. The current density, therefore, is J p = ∂P ∂t . (7.49) This polarization current has nothing to do with the bound current Jb.The latter is associated with magnetization of the material and involves the spin and orbital motion of electrons; J p, by contrast, is the result of the linear motion of charge when the electric polarization changes. If P points to the right, and is increasing, then each plus charge moves a bit to the right and each minus charge to the left; the cumulative effect is the polarization current J p. We ought to check that Eq. 7.49 is consistent with the continuity equation: ∇ · J p = ∇ · ∂P ∂t = ∂ ∂t (∇ · P) =− ∂ρb ∂t . P da⊥ −σb +σb FIGURE 7.47 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 341 Yes: The continuity equation is satisﬁed; in fact, J p is essential to ensure the conservation of bound charge. (Incidentally, a changing magnetization does not lead to any analogous accumulation of charge or current. The bound current Jb = ∇ × M varies in response to changes in M, to be sure, but that’s about it.) In view of all this, the total charge density can be separated into two parts: ρ = ρ f + ρb = ρ f − ∇ · P, (7.50) and the current density into three parts: J = J f + Jb + J p = J f + ∇ × M + ∂P ∂t . (7.51) Gauss’s law can now be written as ∇ · E = 1 <0 (ρ f − ∇ · P), or ∇ · D = ρ f , (7.52) where, as in the static case, D ≡ <0E + P. (7.53) Meanwhile, Ampère’s law (with Maxwell’s term) becomes ∇ × B = μ0 ( J f + ∇ × M + ∂P ∂t ) + μ0<0 ∂E ∂t , or ∇ × H = J f + ∂D ∂t , (7.54) where, as before, H ≡ 1 μ0 B − M. (7.55) Faraday’s law and ∇ · B = 0 are not affected by our separation of charge and current into free and bound parts, since they do not involve ρ or J. In terms of free charges and currents, then, Maxwell’s equations read (i) ∇ · D = ρ f ,(iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × H = J f + ∂D ∂t . (7.56) Some people regard these as the “true” Maxwell’s equations, but please under- stand that they are in no way more “general” than Eq. 7.40; they simply reﬂect a convenient division of charge and current into free and nonfree parts. And they 342 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics have the disadvantage of hybrid notation, since they contain both E and D, both B and H. They must be supplemented, therefore, by appropriate constitutive relations,giving D and H in terms of E and B. These depend on the nature of the material; for linear media P = <0χeE, and M = χmH, (7.57) so D = <E, and H = 1 μ B, (7.58) where < ≡ <0(1 + χe) and μ ≡ μ0(1 + χm). Incidentally, you’ll remember that D is called the electric “displacement”; that’s why the second term in the Ampère/Maxwell equation (iv) came to be called the displacement current. In this context, Jd ≡ ∂D ∂t . (7.59) Problem 7.40 Sea water at frequency ν = 4 × 108 Hz has permittivity < = 81<0, permeability μ = μ0, and resistivity ρ = 0.23 \u0007 · m. What is the ratio of conduc- tion current to displacement current? [Hint: Consider a parallel-plate capacitor im- mersed in sea water and driven by a voltage V0 cos (2πνt).] 7.3.6 Boundary Conditions In general, the ﬁelds E, B, D, and H will be discontinuous at a boundary between two different media, or at a surface that carries a charge density σ or a current den- sity K. The explicit form of these discontinuities can be deduced from Maxwell’s equations (7.56), in their integral form (i) ∮ S D · da = Q fenc (ii) ∮ S B · da = 0 ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ over any closed surface S. (iii) ∮ P E · dl =− d dt √ S B · da (iv) ∮ P H · dl = I fenc + d dt √ S D · da ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ for any surface S bounded by the closed loop P. Applying (i) to a tiny, wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox extending just slightly into the material on either side of the boundary (Fig. 7.48), we obtain: D1 · a − D2 · a = σ f a. (The positive direction for a is from 2 toward 1. The edge of the wafer con- tributes nothing in the limit as the thickness goes to zero; nor does any volume 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 343 σf D2 1 2 D1 a FIGURE 7.48 charge density.) Thus, the component of D that is perpendicular to the interface is discontinuous in the amount D⊥ 1 − D⊥ 2 = σ f . (7.60) Identical reasoning, applied to equation (ii), yields B⊥ 1 − B⊥ 2 = 0. (7.61) Turning to (iii), a very thin Amperian loop straddling the surface gives E1 · l − E2 · l =− d dt √ S B · da. But in the limit as the width of the loop goes to zero, the ﬂux vanishes. (I have already dropped the contribution of the two ends to ∮ E · dl, on the same grounds.) Therefore, E ∥ 1 − E ∥ 2 = 0. (7.62) That is, the components of E parallel to the interface are continuous across the boundary. By the same token, (iv) implies H1 · l − H2 · l = I fenc , where I fenc is the free current passing through the Amperian loop. No volume current density will contribute (in the limit of inﬁnitesimal width), but a surface current can. In fact, if ˆn is a unit vector perpendicular to the interface (pointing from 2 toward 1), so that ( ˆn × l) is normal to the Amperian loop (Fig. 7.49), then I fenc = K f · ( ˆn × l) = (K f × ˆn) · l, 344 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Kf 1 2 l n FIGURE 7.49 and hence H ∥ 1 − H ∥ 2 = K f × ˆn. (7.63) So the parallel components of H are discontinuous by an amount proportional to the free surface current density. Equations 7.60-63 are the general boundary conditions for electrodynamics. In the case of linear media, they can be expressed in terms of E and B alone: (i)<1 E ⊥ 1 − <2 E ⊥ 2 = σ f ,(iii) E ∥ 1 − E ∥ 2 = 0, (ii) B⊥ 1 − B⊥ 2 = 0,(iv) 1 μ1 B ∥ 1 − 1 μ2 B ∥ 2 = K f × ˆn. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (7.64) In particular, if there is no free charge or free current at the interface, then (i)<1 E ⊥ 1 − <2 E ⊥ 2 = 0,(iii) E ∥ 1 − E ∥ 2 = 0, (ii) B⊥ 1 − B⊥ 2 = 0,(iv) 1 μ1 B ∥ 1 − 1 μ2 B ∥ 2 = 0. (7.65) As we shall see in Chapter 9, these equations are the basis for the theory of reﬂec- tion and refraction. More Problems on Chapter 7 Problem 7.41 Two long, straight copper pipes, each of radius a, are held a dis-! tance 2d apart (see Fig. 7.50). One is at potential V0, the other at −V0. The space surrounding the pipes is ﬁlled with weakly conducting material of conductivity σ . Find the current per unit length that ﬂows from one pipe to the other. [Hint: Refer to Prob. 3.12.] 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 345 2d–V0 a a +V0 σ FIGURE 7.50 Problem 7.42 A rare case in which the electrostatic ﬁeld E for a circuit can actually! be calculated is the following:28 Imagine an inﬁnitely long cylindrical sheet, of uniform resistivity and radius a. A slot (corresponding to the battery) is maintained at ±V0/2, at φ =±π , and a steady current ﬂows over the surface, as indicated in Fig. 7.51. According to Ohm’s law, then, V (a,φ) = V0φ 2π ,(−π< φ < +π). x z s K a φ +V0/2 −V0/2 FIGURE 7.51 (a) Use separation of variables in cylindrical coordinates to determine V (s,φ) in- side and outside the cylinder.

[Answer: (<0V0/πa) tan(φ/2)] Problem 7.43 The magnetic ﬁeld outside a long straight wire carrying a steady current I is B = μ0 2π I s ˆφ. The electric ﬁeld inside the wire is uniform: E = Iρ πa2 ˆz, 28M. A. Heald, Am.J.Phys. 52, 522 (1984). See also J. A. Hernandes and A. K. T. Assis, Phys. Rev. E 68, 046611 (2003). 346 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics where ρ is the resistivity and a is the radius (see Exs. 7.1 and 7.3). Question: What is the electric ﬁeld outside the wire? 29 The answer depends on how you complete the circuit. Suppose the current returns along a perfectly conducting grounded coax- ial cylinder of radius b (Fig. 7.52). In the region a < s < b, the potential V (s, z) satisﬁes Laplace’s equation, with the boundary conditions (i) V (a, z) =− Iρz πa2 ; (ii) V (b, z) = 0. z a b I I FIGURE 7.52 This does not sufﬁce to determine the answer—we still need to specify boundary conditions at the two ends (though for a long wire it shouldn’t matter much). In the literature, it is customary to sweep this ambiguity under the rug by simply stipulat- ing that V (s, z) is proportional to z: V (s, z) = zf (s). On this assumption: (a) Determine f (s). (b) Find E(s, z). (c) Calculate the surface charge density σ(z) on the wire. [Answer: V = (−Izρ/πa2)[ln(s/b)/ ln(a/b)] This is a peculiar result, since Es and σ(z) are not independent of z—as one would certainly expect for a truly inﬁnite wire.] Problem 7.44 In a perfect conductor, the conductivity is inﬁnite, so E = 0 (Eq. 7.3), and any net charge resides on the surface (just as it does for an imperfect conductor, in electrostatics). (a) Show that the magnetic ﬁeld is constant (∂B/∂t = 0), inside a perfect conductor. (b) Show that the magnetic ﬂux through a perfectly conducting loop is constant. A superconductor is a perfect conductor with the additional property that the (constant) B inside is in fact zero. (This “ﬂux exclusion” is known as the Meissner effect.30) 29This is a famous problem, ﬁrst analyzed by Sommerfeld, and is known in its most recent incarna- tion as Merzbacher’s puzzle.A.Sommerfeld, Electrodynamics, p. 125 (New York: Academic Press, 1952); E. Merzbacher, Am.J.Phys. 48, 178 (1980); further references in R. N. Varnay and L. H. Fisher, Am.J.Phys. 52, 1097 (1984). 30The Meissner effect is sometimes referred to as “perfect diamagnetism,” in the sense that the ﬁeld inside is not merely reduced, but canceled entirely. However, the surface currents responsible for this are free, not bound, so the actual mechanism is quite different. 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 347 (c) Show that the current in a superconductor is conﬁned to the surface. (d) Superconductivity is lost above a certain critical temperature (Tc), which varies from one material to another. Suppose you had a sphere (radius a) above its critical temperature, and you held it in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0 ˆz while cool- ing it below Tc. Find the induced surface current density K, as a function of the polar angle θ . Problem 7.45 A familiar demonstration of superconductivity (Prob. 7.44) is the lev- itation of a magnet over a piece of superconducting material. This phenomenon can be analyzed using the method of images. 31 Treat the magnet as a perfect dipole m, a height z above the origin (and constrained to point in the z direction), and pretend that the superconductor occupies the entire half-space below the xy plane. Because of the Meissner effect, B = 0 for z ≤ 0, and since B is divergenceless, the normal (z) component is continuous, so Bz = 0just above the surface. This boundary con- dition is met by the image conﬁguration in which an identical dipole is placed at −z, as a stand-in for the superconductor; the two arrangements therefore produce the same magnetic ﬁeld in the region z > 0. (a) Which way should the image dipole point (+z or −z)? (b) Find the force on the magnet due to the induced currents in the superconductor (which is to say, the force due to the image dipole). Set it equal to Mg (where M is the mass of the magnet) to determine the height h at which the magnet will “ﬂoat.” [Hint: Refer to Prob. 6.3.] (c) The induced current on the surface of the superconductor (the xy plane) can be determined from the boundary condition on the tangential component of B (Eq. 5.76): B = μ0(K × ˆz). Using the ﬁeld you get from the image conﬁgura- tion, show that K =− 3mr h 2π(r 2 + h2)5/2 ˆφ, where r is the distance from the origin. Problem 7.46 If a magnetic dipole levitating above an inﬁnite superconducting! plane (Prob. 7.45) is free to rotate, what orientation will it adopt, and how high above the surface will it ﬂoat? Problem 7.47 A perfectly conducting spherical shell of radius a rotates about the z axis with angular velocity ω, in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B = B0 ˆz. Calculate the emf developed between the “north pole” and the equator. [Answer: 1 2 B0ωa2] Problem 7.48 Refer to Prob. 7.11 (and use the result of Prob. 5.42): How long does! is take a falling circular ring (radius a,mass m, resistance R) to cross the bottom of the magnetic ﬁeld B, at its (changing) terminal velocity? 31W. M. Saslow, Am.J.Phys. 59, 16 (1991). 348 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics Problem 7.49 (a) Referring to Prob. 5.52(a) and Eq. 7.18, show that E =− ∂A ∂t , (7.66) for Faraday-induced electric ﬁelds. Check this result by taking the divergence and curl of both sides. (b) A spherical shell of radius R carries a uniform surface charge σ . It spins about a ﬁxed axis at an angular velocity ω(t) that changes slowly with time. Find the electric ﬁeld inside and outside the sphere. [Hint: There are two contributions here: the Coulomb ﬁeld due to the charge, and the Faraday ﬁeld due to the changing B. Refer to Ex. 5.11.] Problem 7.50 Electrons undergoing cyclotron motion can be sped up by increasing the magnetic ﬁeld; the accompanying electric ﬁeld will impart tangential acceler- ation. This is the principle of the betatron. One would like to keep the radius of the orbit constant during the process. Show that this can be achieved by designing a magnet such that the average ﬁeld over the area of the orbit is twice the ﬁeld at the circumference (Fig. 7.53). Assume the electrons start from rest in zero ﬁeld, and that the apparatus is symmetric about the center of the orbit. (Assume also that the electron velocity remains well below the speed of light, so that nonrelativis- tic mechanics applies.)

Find the electric ﬁeld, in the qua- sistatic approximation, at the instant the wire coincides with the z axis (Fig. 7.54). [Answer: −(μ0 I v/2π s) sin φ ˆz] Problem 7.52 An atomic electron (charge q) circles about the nucleus (charge Q) in an orbit of radius r ; the centripetal acceleration is provided, of course, by the Coulomb attraction of opposite charges. Now a small magnetic ﬁeld dB is slowly turned on, perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. Show that the increase in kinetic energy, dT , imparted by the induced electric ﬁeld, is just right to sustain circular motion at the same radius r. (That’s why, in my discussion of diamagnetism, I assumed the radius is ﬁxed. See Sect. 6.1.3 and the references cited there.) 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 349 R2R1 Solenoid B I A b a b a V1 V2 FIGURE 7.55 Problem 7.53 The current in a long solenoid is increasing linearly with time, so the ﬂux is proportional to t: \u000b = αt. Two voltmeters are connected to diametrically op- posite points (A and B), together with resistors (R1 and R2), as shown in Fig. 7.55. What is the reading on each voltmeter? Assume that these are ideal voltmeters that draw negligible current (they have huge internal resistance), and that a volt- meter registers − ∫ b a E · dl between the terminals and through the meter.

[Answer: αr 2/2] Problem 7.55 In the discussion of motional emf (Sect. 7.1.3) I assumed that the wire loop (Fig. 7.10) has a resistance R; the current generated is then I = v Bh/R. But what if the wire is made out of perfectly conducting material, so that R is zero? In that case, the current is limited only by the back emf associated with the self- inductance L of the loop (which would ordinarily be negligible in comparison with IR). Show that in this régime the loop (mass m) executes simple harmonic motion, and ﬁnd its frequency. 33 [Answer: ω = Bh/ √mL] 32R. H. Romer, Am.J.Phys. 50, 1089 (1982). See also H. W. Nicholson, Am. J.

Compare your answer to Prob. 7.22. (b) For the general case (not assuming a is small), show that M = μ0πβ 2 √ abβ ( 1 + 15 8 β 2 + ... ) , where β ≡ ab z2 + a2 + b2 . Primary (N1 turns) Secondary (N2 turns) FIGURE 7.57 Problem 7.57 Two coils are wrapped around a cylindrical form in such a way that the same ﬂux passes through every turn of both coils. (In practice this is achieved by inserting an iron core through the cylinder; this has the effect of concentrating the ﬂux.) The primary coil has N1 turns and the secondary has N2 (Fig. 7.57). If the current I in the primary is changing, show that the emf in the secondary is given by E2 E1 = N2 N1 , (7.67) where E1 is the (back) emf of the primary. [This is a primitive transformer—a device for raising or lowering the emf of an alternating current source. By choosing the appropriate number of turns, any desired secondary emf can be obtained. If you think this violates the conservation of energy, study Prob. 7.58.] Problem 7.58 A transformer (Prob. 7.57) takes an input AC voltage of amplitude V1, and delivers an output voltage of amplitude V2, which is determined by the turns ratio (V2/V1 = N2/N1). If N2 > N1, the output voltage is greater than the input voltage. Why doesn’t this violate conservation of energy? Answer: Power is the product of voltage and current; if the voltage goes up, the current must come down. The purpose of this problem is to see exactly how this works out, in a simpliﬁed model. 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 351 (a) In an ideal transformer, the same ﬂux passes through all turns of the primary and of the secondary. Show that in this case M 2 = L 1 L 2,where M is the mutual inductance of the coils, and L 1, L 2 are their individual self-inductances. (b) Suppose the primary is driven with AC voltage Vin = V1 cos (ωt), and the sec- ondary is connected to a resistor, R. Show that the two currents satisfy the relations L 1 dI1 dt + M dI2 dt = V1 cos (ωt); L 2 dI2 dt + M dI1 dt =−I2 R. (c) Using the result in (a), solve these equations for I1(t) and I2(t). (Assume I1 has no DC component.) (d) Show that the output voltage (Vout = I2 R) divided by the input voltage (Vin)is equal to the turns ratio: Vout/Vin = N2/N1. (e) Calculate the input power (Pin = Vin I1) and the output power (Pout = Vout I2), and show that their averages over a full cycle are equal. Problem 7.59 An inﬁnite wire runs along the z axis; it carries a current I (z) that is a function of z (but not of t), and a charge density λ(t) that is a function of t (but not of z). (a) By examining the charge ﬂowing into a segment dz in a time dt, show that dλ/dt =−dI /dz. If we stipulate that λ(0) = 0and I (0) = 0, show that λ(t) = kt, I (z) =−kz,where k is a constant. (b) Assume for a moment that the process is quasistatic, so the ﬁelds are given by Eqs. 2.9 and 5.38. Show that these are in fact the exact ﬁelds, by conﬁrm- ing that all four of Maxwell’s equations are satisﬁed. (First do it in differential form, for the region s > 0, then in integral form for the appropriate Gaussian cylinder/Amperian loop straddling the axis.) Problem 7.60 Suppose J(r) is constant in time but ρ(r, t) is not—conditions that might prevail, for instance, during the charging of a capacitor. (a) Show that the charge density at any particular point is a linear function of time: ρ(r, t) = ρ(r, 0) +˙ρ(r, 0)t, where ˙ρ(r, 0) is the time derivative of ρ at t = 0. [Hint: Use the continuity equation.] This is not an electrostatic or magnetostatic conﬁguration;34 nevertheless, rather surprisingly, both Coulomb’s law (Eq. 2.8) and the Biot-Savart law (Eq. 5.42) hold, as you can conﬁrm by showing that they satisfy Maxwell’s equations. In particular: 34Some authors would regard this as magnetostatic, since B is independent of t. For them, the Biot- Savart law is a general rule of magnetostatics, but ∇ · J = 0and ∇ × B = μ0J apply only under the additional assumption that ρ is constant. In such a formulation, Maxwell’s displacement term can (in this very special case) be derived from the Biot-Savart law, by the method of part (b). See D. F. Bartlett, Am. J. Phys. 58, 1168 (1990); D. J. Grifﬁths and M. A. Heald, Am.J.Phys. 59, 111 (1991). 352 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics (b) Show that B(r) = μ0 4π √ J(r ′) × ˆr r2 dτ ′ obeys Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s displacement current term. Problem 7.61 The magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnite straight wire carrying a steady cur- rent I can be obtained from the displacement current term in the Ampère/Maxwell law, as follows: Picture the current as consisting of a uniform line charge λ mov- ing along the z axis at speed v (so that I = λv), with a tiny gap of length <,which reaches the origin at time t = 0. In the next instant (up to t = </v) there is no real current passing through a circular Amperian loop in the xy plane, but there is a displacement current, due to the “missing” charge in the gap. (a) Use Coulomb’s law to calculate the z component of the electric ﬁeld, for points in the xy plane a distance s from the origin, due to a segment of wire with uniform density −λ extending from z1 = vt − < to z2 = vt. (b) Determine the ﬂux of this electric ﬁeld through a circle of radius a in the xy plane. (c) Find the displacement current through this circle. Show that Id is equal to I ,in the limit as the gap width (<) goes to zero. 35 Problem 7.62 A certain transmission line is constructed from two thin metal “rib- bons,” of width w, a very small distance h ≪ w apart. The current travels down one strip and back along the other. In each case, it spreads out uniformly over the surface of the ribbon. (a) Find the capacitance per unit length, C. (b) Find the inductance per unit length, L. (c) What is the product LC, numerically? [L and C will, of course, vary from one kind of transmission line to another, but their product is a universal constant— check, for example, the cable in Ex. 7.13—provided the space between the con- ductors is a vacuum. In the theory of transmission lines, this product is related to the speed with which a pulse propagates down the line: v = 1/√LC.] (d) If the strips are insulated from one another by a nonconducting material of per- mittivity < and permeability μ, what then is the product LC? What is the propa- gation speed? [Hint: see Ex. 4.6; by what factor does L change when an inductor is immersed in linear material of permeability μ?] Problem 7.63 Prove Alfven’s theorem: In a perfectly conducting ﬂuid (say, a gas of free electrons), the magnetic ﬂux through any closed loop moving with the ﬂuid is constant in time. (The magnetic ﬁeld lines are, as it were, “frozen” into the ﬂuid.) (a) Use Ohm’s law, in the form of Eq. 7.2, together with Faraday’s law, to prove that if σ =∞ and J is ﬁnite, then ∂B ∂t = ∇ × (v × B). 35For a slightly different approach to the same problem, see W. K. Terry, Am. J. Phys. 50, 742 (1982). 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 353 S′ P R P′ vdtS FIGURE 7.58 (b) Let S be the surface bounded by the loop (P) at time t,and S ′ a surface bounded by the loop in its new position (P ′) at time t + dt (see Fig. 7.58). The change in ﬂux is d\u000b = √ S′ B(t + dt) · da − √ S B(t) · da. Use ∇ · B = 0 to show that √ S′ B(t + dt) · da + √ R B(t + dt) · da = √ S B(t + dt) · da (where R is the “ribbon” joining P and P ′), and hence that d\u000b = dt √ S ∂B ∂t · da − √ R B(t + dt) · da (for inﬁnitesimal dt). Use the method of Sect. 7.1.3 to rewrite the second inte- gral as dt ∮ P (B × v) · dl, and invoke Stokes’ theorem to conclude that d\u000b dt = √ S ( ∂B ∂t − ∇ × (v × B)) · da. Together with the result in (a), this proves the theorem. Problem 7.64 (a) Show that Maxwell’s equations with magnetic charge (Eq. 7.44) are invariant under the duality transformation E′ = E cos α + cB sin α, cB′ = cB cos α − E sin α, cq ′ e = cqe cos α + qm sin α, q ′ m = qm cos α − cqe sin α, ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (7.68) where c ≡ 1/ √ <0μ0 and α is an arbitrary rotation angle in “E/B-space.” Charge and current densities transform in the same way as qe and qm. [This means, in 354 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics particular, that if you know the ﬁelds produced by a conﬁguration of electric charge, you can immediately (using α = 90◦) write down the ﬁelds produced by the corresponding arrangement of magnetic charge.] (b) Show that the force law (Prob. 7.38) F = qe(E + v × B) + qm (B − 1 c2 v × E) (7.69) is also invariant under the duality transformation. Intermission All of our cards are now on the table, and in a sense my job is done. In the ﬁrst seven chapters we assembled electrodynamics piece by piece, and now, with Maxwell’s equations in their ﬁnal form, the theory is complete. There are no more laws to be learned, no further generalizations to be considered, and (with perhaps one exception) no lurking inconsistencies to be resolved. If yours is a one-semester course, this would be a reasonable place to stop. But in another sense we have just arrived at the starting point. We are at last in possession of a full deck—it’s time to deal. This is the fun part, in which one comes to appreciate the extraordinary power and richness of electrodynamics. In a full-year course there should be plenty of time to cover the remaining chapters, and perhaps to supplement them with a unit on plasma physics, say, or AC circuit theory, or even a little general relativity. But if you have room for only one topic, I’d recommend Chapter 9, on Electromagnetic Waves (you’ll probably want to skim Chapter 8 as preparation). This is the segue to Optics, and is historically the most important application of Maxwell’s theory. 355 CHAPTER 8 Conservation Laws 8.1 CHARGE AND ENERGY 8.1.1 The Continuity Equation In this chapter we study conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momen- tum, in electrodynamics. But I want to begin by reviewing the conservation of charge, because it is the paradigm for all conservation laws. What precisely does conservation of charge tell us? That the total charge in the universe is constant? Well, sure—that’s global conservation of charge. But local conservation of charge is a much stronger statement: If the charge in some region changes, then exactly that amount of charge must have passed in or out through the surface. The tiger can’t simply rematerialize outside the cage; if it got from inside to outside it must have slipped through a hole in the fence. Formally, the charge in a volume V is Q(t) = √ V ρ(r, t) dτ, (8.1) and the current ﬂowing out through the boundary S is ∮ S J · da, so local conser- vation of charge says dQ dt =− ∮ S J · da. (8.2) Using Eq. 8.1 to rewrite the left side, and invoking the divergence theorem on the right, we have √ V ∂ρ ∂t dτ =− √ V ∇ · J dτ, (8.3) and since this is true for any volume, it follows that ∂ρ ∂t =−∇ · J. (8.4) This is the continuity equation—the precise mathematical statement of lo- cal conservation of charge. It can be derived from Maxwell’s equations— conservation of charge is not an independent assumption; it is built into the laws 356 8.1 Charge and Energy 357 of electrodynamics. It serves as a constraint on the sources (ρ and J). They can’t be just any old functions—they have to respect conservation of charge.1 The purpose of this chapter is to develop the corresponding equations for local conservation of energy and momentum. In the process (and perhaps more impor- tant) we will learn how to express the energy density and the momentum density (the analogs to ρ), as well as the energy “current” and the momentum “current” (analogous to J). 8.1.2 Poynting’s Theorem In Chapter 2, we found that the work necessary to assemble a static charge distri- bution (against the Coulomb repulsion of like charges) is (Eq. 2.45) We = .0 2 √ E 2 dτ, where E is the resulting electric ﬁeld. Likewise, the work required to get currents going (against the back emf) is (Eq. 7.35) Wm = 1 2μ0 √ B2 dτ, where B is the resulting magnetic ﬁeld. This suggests that the total energy stored in electromagnetic ﬁelds, per unit volume, is u = 1 2 ( .0 E 2 + 1 μ0 B2) . (8.5) In this section I will conﬁrm Eq. 8.5, and develop the energy conservation law for electrodynamics. Suppose we have some charge and current conﬁguration which, at time t,pro- duces ﬁelds E and B. In the next instant, dt, the charges move around a bit. Question: How much work, dW , is done by the electromagnetic forces acting on these charges, in the interval dt? According to the Lorentz force law, the work done on a charge q is F · dl = q(E + v × B) · v dt = qE · v dt. In terms of the charge and current densities, q → ρdτ and ρv → J, 2 so the rate at which work is done on all the charges in a volume V is dW dt = √ V (E · J) dτ. (8.6) 1The continuity equation is the only such constraint. Any functions ρ(r, t) and J(r, t) consistent with Eq. 8.4 constitute possible charge and current densities, in the sense of admitting solutions to Maxwell’s equations. 2This is a slippery equation: after all, if charges of both signs are present, the net charge density can be zero even when the current is not—in fact, this is the case for ordinary current-carrying wires. We should really treat the positive and negative charges separately, and combine the two to get Eq. 8.6, with J = ρ+v+ + ρ−v−. 358 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws Evidently E · J is the work done per unit time, per unit volume—which is to say, the power delivered per unit volume. We can express this quantity in terms of the ﬁelds alone, using the Ampère-Maxwell law to eliminate J: E · J = 1 μ0 E · (∇ × B) − .0E · ∂E ∂t . From product rule 6, ∇ · (E × B) = B · (∇ × E) − E · (∇ × B). Invoking Faraday’s law (∇ × E =−∂B/∂t),itfollows that E · (∇ × B) =−B · ∂B ∂t − ∇ · (E × B). Meanwhile, B · ∂B ∂t = 1 2 ∂ ∂t (B2), and E · ∂E ∂t = 1 2 ∂ ∂t (E 2), (8.7) so E · J =− 1 2 ∂ ∂t ( .0 E 2 + 1 μ0 B2) − 1 μ0 ∇ · (E × B). (8.8) Putting this into Eq. 8.6, and applying the divergence theorem to the second term, we have dW dt =− d dt √ V 1 2 (.0 E 2 + 1 μ0 B2) dτ − 1 μ0 ∮ S (E × B) · da, (8.9) where S is the surface bounding V.Thisis Poynting’s theorem; it is the “work- energy theorem” of electrodynamics. The ﬁrst integral on the right is the total energy stored in the ﬁelds, ∫ udτ (Eq. 8.5). The second term evidently represents the rate at which energy is transported out of V, across its boundary surface, by the electromagnetic ﬁelds. Poynting’s theorem says, then, that the work done on the charges by the electromagnetic force is equal to the decrease in energy remaining in the ﬁelds, less the energy that ﬂowed out through the surface. The energy per unit time, per unit area, transported by the ﬁelds is called the Poynting vector: S ≡ 1 μ0 (E × B). (8.10) Speciﬁcally, S · da is the energy per unit time crossing the inﬁnitesimal sur- face da—the energy ﬂux (so S is the energy ﬂux density). 3 We will see many 3If you’re very fastidious, you’ll notice a small gap in the logic here: We know from Eq. 8.9 that∮ S · da is the total power passing through a closed surface, but this does not prove that ∫ S · da is the power passing through any open surface (there could be an extra term that integrates to zero over all closed surfaces). This is, however, the obvious and natural interpretation; as always, the precise location of energy is not really determined in electrodynamics (see Sect. 2.4.4). 8.1 Charge and Energy 359 applications of the Poynting vector in Chapters 9 and 11, but for the moment I am mainly interested in using it to express Poynting’s theorem more compactly: dW dt =− d dt √ V udτ − ∮ S S · da. (8.11) What if no work is done on the charges in V—what if, for example, we are in a region of empty space, where there is no charge? In that case dW/dt = 0, so √ ∂u ∂t dτ =− ∮ S · da =− √ (∇ · S) dτ, and hence ∂u ∂t =−∇ · S. (8.12) This is the “continuity equation” for energy—u (energy density) plays the role of ρ (charge density), and S takes the part of J (current density). It expresses local conservation of electromagnetic energy. In general, though, electromagnetic energy by itself is not conserved (nor is the energy of the charges). Of course not! The ﬁelds do work on the charges, and the charges create ﬁelds—energy is tossed back and forth between them. In the overall energy economy, you must include the contributions of both the matter and the ﬁelds. Example 8.1. When current ﬂows down a wire, work is done, which shows up as Joule heating of the wire (Eq. 7.7). Though there are certainly easier ways to do it, the energy per unit time delivered to the wire can be calculated using the Poynting vector. Assuming it’s uniform, the electric ﬁeld parallel to the wire is E = V L , where V is the potential difference between the ends and L is the length of the wire (Fig. 8.1). The magnetic ﬁeld is “circumferential”; at the surface (radius a) it has the value B = μ0 I 2πa . L a S B E I FIGURE 8.1 360 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws Accordingly, the magnitude of the Poynting vector is S = 1 μ0 V L μ0 I 2πa = VI 2πaL , and it points radially inward. The energy per unit time passing in through the surface of the wire is therefore √ S · da = S(2πaL) = VI, which is exactly what we concluded, on much more direct grounds, in Sect. 7.1.1. 4 Problem 8.1 Calculate the power (energy per unit time) transported down the cables of Ex. 7.13 and Prob. 7.62, assuming the two conductors are held at potential difference V , and carry current I (down one and back up the other). Problem 8.2 Consider the charging capacitor in Prob. 7.34. (a) Find the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the gap, as functions of the distance s from the axis and the time t. (Assume the charge is zero at t = 0.) (b) Find the energy density uem and the Poynting vector S in the gap. Note espe- cially the direction of S. Check that Eq. 8.12 is satisﬁed. (c) Determine the total energy in the gap, as a function of time. Calculate the total power ﬂowing into the gap, by integrating the Poynting vector over the appro- priate surface. Check that the power input is equal to the rate of increase of energy in the gap (Eq. 8.9—in this case W = 0, because there is no charge in the gap). [If you’re worried about the fringing ﬁelds, do it for a volume of radius b < a well inside the gap.] 8.2 MOMENTUM 8.2.1 Newton’s Third Law in Electrodynamics Imagine a point charge q traveling in along the x axis at a constant speed v. Because it is moving, its electric ﬁeld is not given by Coulomb’s law; never- theless, E still points radially outward from the instantaneous position of the charge (Fig. 8.2a), as we’ll see in Chapter 10. Since, moreover, a moving point charge does not constitute a steady current, its magnetic ﬁeld is not givenbythe Biot-Savart law. Nevertheless, it’s a fact that B still circles around the axis in a manner suggested by the right-hand rule (Fig. 8.2b); again, the proof will come in Chapter 10. 4What about energy ﬂow down the wire? For a discussion, see M. K. Harbola, Am. J. Phys. 78, 1203 (2010). For a more sophisticated geometry, see B. S. Davis and L. Kaplan, Am.J.Phys. 79, 1155 (2011). 8.2 Momentum 361 E B v x v x (a) (b) FIGURE 8.2 Now suppose this charge encounters an identical one, proceeding in at the same speed along the y axis. Of course, the electromagnetic force between them would tend to drive them off the axes, but let’s assume that they’re mounted on tracks, or something, so they’re obliged to maintain the same direction and the same speed (Fig. 8.3). The electric force between them is repulsive, but how about the magnetic force? Well, the magnetic ﬁeld of q1 points into the page (at the position of q2), so the magnetic force on q2 is toward the right, whereas the magnetic ﬁeld of q2 is out of the page (at the position of q1), and the magnetic force on q1 is upward. The net electromagnetic force of q1 on q2 is equal but not opposite to the force of q2 on q1, in violation of Newton’s third law. In electrostatics and magnetostatics the third law holds, but in electrodynamics it does not. Well, that’s an interesting curiosity, but then, how often does one actually use the third law, in practice? Answer: All the time! For the proof of conservation of momentum rests on the cancellation of internal forces, which follows from the third law. When you tamper with the third law, you are placing conservation of momentum in jeopardy, and there is hardly any principle in physics more sacred than that. Momentum conservation is rescued, in electrodynamics, by the realization that the ﬁelds themselves carry momentum. This is not so surprising when you x y z B1 q1 q2 Fm Fe v2 Fm FeB2 v1 FIGURE 8.3 362 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws consider that we have already attributed energy to the ﬁelds. Whatever momen- tum is lost to the particles is gained by the ﬁelds. Only when the ﬁeld momentum is added to the mechanical momentum is momentum conservation restored. 8.2.2 Maxwell’s Stress Tensor Let’s calculate the total electromagnetic force on the charges in volume V: F = √ V (E + v × B)ρ dτ = √ V (ρE + J × B) dτ. (8.13) The force per unit volume is f = ρE + J × B. (8.14) As before, I propose to express this in terms of ﬁelds alone, eliminating ρ and J by using Maxwell’s equations (i) and (iv): f = .0(∇ · E)E + ( 1 μ0 ∇ × B − .0 ∂E ∂t ) × B. Now ∂ ∂t (E × B) = ( ∂E ∂t × B ) + (E × ∂B ∂t ) , and Faraday’s law says ∂B ∂t =−∇ × E, so ∂E ∂t × B = ∂ ∂t (E × B) + E × (∇ × E). Thus f = .0 [(∇ · E)E − E × (∇ × E)] − 1 μ0 [B × (∇ × B)] − .0 ∂ ∂t (E × B). (8.15) Just to make things look more symmetrical, let’s throw in a term (∇ · B)B; since ∇ · B = 0, this costs us nothing. Meanwhile, product rule 4 says ∇(E 2) = 2(E · ∇)E + 2E × (∇ × E), so E × (∇ × E) = 1 2 ∇(E 2) − (E · ∇)E, 8.2 Momentum 363 and the same goes for B. Therefore, f = .0 [(∇ · E)E + (E · ∇)E] + 1 μ0 [(∇ · B)B + (B · ∇)B] − 1 2 ∇ ( .0 E 2 + 1 μ0 B2) − .0 ∂ ∂t (E × B). (8.16) Ugly! But it can be simpliﬁed by introducing the Maxwell stress tensor, Tij ≡ .0 (Ei E j − 1 2 δij E 2) + 1 μ0 (Bi B j − 1 2 δij B2) . (8.17) The indices i and j refer to the coordinates x, y, and z, so the stress tensor has a total of nine components (Txx , Tyy, Txz, Tyx , and so on). The Kronecker delta, δij , is 1 if the indices are the same (δxx = δyy = δzz = 1) and zero otherwise (δxy = δxz = δyz = 0). Thus Txx = 1 2 .0 (E 2 x − E 2 y − E 2 z ) + 1 2μ0 (B2 x − B2 y − B2 z ) , Txy = .0(Ex E y) + 1 μ0 (Bx By), and so on. Because it carries two indices, where a vector has only one, Tij is sometimes written with a double arrow: ↔ T . One can form the dot product of ↔ T with a vector a, in two ways—on the left, and on the right: ( a · ↔ T ) j = ∑ i=x,y,z ai Tij , ( ↔ T · a ) j = ∑ i=x,y,z T ji ai . (8.18) The resulting object, which has one remaining index, is itself a vector. In particu- lar, the divergence of ↔ T has as its jth component ( ∇ · ↔ T ) j = .0 [ (∇ · E)E j + (E · ∇)E j − 1 2 ∇j E 2] + 1 μ0 [ (∇ · B)B j + (B · ∇)B j − 1 2 ∇j B2] . Thus the force per unit volume (Eq. 8.16) can be written in the much tidier form f = ∇ · ↔ T − .0μ0 ∂S ∂t , (8.19) where S is the Poynting vector (Eq. 8.10). 364 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws The total electromagnetic force on the charges in V (Eq. 8.13) is F = ∮ S ↔ T · da − .0μ0 d dt √ V S dτ. (8.20) (I used the divergence theorem to convert the ﬁrst term to a surface integral.) In the static case the second term drops out, and the electromagnetic force on the charge conﬁguration can be expressed entirely in terms of the stress tensor at the boundary: F = ∮ S ↔ T · da (static). (8.21) Physically, ↔ T is the force per unit area (or stress) acting on the surface. More precisely, Tij is the force (per unit area) in the ith direction acting on an ele- ment of surface oriented in the jth direction—“diagonal” elements (Txx , Tyy, Tzz) represent pressures, and “off-diagonal” elements (Txy, Txz, etc.) are shears. Example 8.2. Determine the net force on the “northern” hemisphere of a uni- formly charged solid sphere of radius R and charge Q (the same as Prob. 2.47, only this time we’ll use the Maxwell stress tensor and Eq. 8.21). y x z Disk Bowl FIGURE 8.4 Solution The boundary surface consists of two parts—a hemispherical “bowl” at radius R, and a circular disk at θ = π/2 (Fig. 8.4). For the bowl, da = R2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr and E = 1 4π.0 Q R2 ˆr. In Cartesian components, ˆr = sin θ cos φ ˆx + sin θ sin φ ˆy + cos θ ˆz, 8.2 Momentum 365 so Tzx = .0 Ez Ex = .0 ( Q 4π.0 R2 )2 sin θ cos θ cos φ, Tzy = .0 Ez E y = .0 ( Q 4π.0 R2 )2 sin θ cos θ sin φ, Tzz = .0 2 (E 2 z − E 2 x − E 2 y) = .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 R2 )2 (cos2 θ − sin 2 θ). (8.22) The net force is obviously in the z-direction, so it sufﬁces to calculate ( ↔ T · da ) z = Tzx dax + Tzy day + Tzz daz = .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 R )2 sin θ cos θ dθ dφ. The force on the “bowl” is therefore Fbowl = .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 R )2 2π √ π/2 0 sin θ cos θ dθ = 1 4π.0 Q2 8R2 . (8.23) Meanwhile, for the equatorial disk, da =−rdrdφ ˆz, (8.24) and (since we are now inside the sphere) E = 1 4π.0 Q R3 r = 1 4π.0 Q R3 r (cos φ ˆx + sin φ ˆy). Thus Tzz = .0 2 (E 2 z − E 2 x − E 2 y) =− .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 R3 )2 r 2, and hence (↔ T · da ) z = .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 R3 )2 r 3 dr dφ. The force on the disk is therefore Fdisk = .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 R3 )2 2π √ R 0 r 3dr = 1 4π.0 Q2 16R2 . (8.25) Combining Eqs. 8.23 and 8.25, I conclude that the net force on the northern hemi- sphere is F = 1 4π.0 3Q2 16R2 . (8.26) 366 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws Incidentally, in applying Eq. 8.21, any volume that encloses all of the charge in question (and no other charge) will do the job. For example, in the present case we could use the whole region z > 0. In that case the boundary surface consists of the entire xy plane (plus a hemisphere at r =∞,but E = 0 out there, so it contributes nothing). In place of the “bowl,” we now have the outer portion of the plane (r > R).Here Tzz =− .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 )2 1 r 4 (Eq. 8.22 with θ = π/2 and R → r ), and da is given by Eq. 8.24, so ( ↔ T · da ) z = .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 )2 1 r 3 dr dφ, and the contribution from the plane for r > R is .0 2 ( Q 4π.0 )2 2π √ ∞ R 1 r 3 dr = 1 4π.0 Q2 8R2 , the same as for the bowl (Eq. 8.23). I hope you didn’t get too bogged down in the details of Ex. 8.2. If so, take a moment to appreciate what happened. We were calculating the force on a solid object, but instead of doing a volume integral, as you might expect, Eq. 8.21 allowed us to set it up as a surface integral; somehow the stress tensor sniffs out what is going on inside. Problem 8.3 Calculate the force of magnetic attraction between the northern! and southern hemispheres of a uniformly charged spinning spherical shell, with radius R, angular velocity ω, and surface charge density σ . [This is the same as Prob. 5.44, but this time use the Maxwell stress tensor and Eq. 8.21.] Problem 8.4 (a) Consider two equal point charges q, separated by a distance 2a. Construct the plane equidistant from the two charges. By integrating Maxwell’s stress tensor over this plane, determine the force of one charge on the other. (b) Do the same for charges that are opposite in sign. 8.2.3 Conservation of Momentum According to Newton’s second law, the force on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum: F = dpmech dt . 8.2 Momentum 367 Equation 8.20 can therefore be written in the form 5 dpmech dt =−.0μ0 d dt √ V S dτ + ∮ S ↔ T · da, (8.27) where pmech is the (mechanical) momentum of the particles in volume V.This expression is similar in structure to Poynting’s theorem (Eq. 8.11), and it invites an analogous interpretation: The ﬁrst integral represents momentum stored in the ﬁelds: p = μ0.0 √ V S dτ, (8.28) while the second integral is the momentum per unit time ﬂowing in through the surface. Equation 8.27 is the statement of conservation of momentum in electro- dynamics: If the mechanical momentum increases, either the ﬁeld momentum decreases, or else the ﬁelds are carrying momentum into the volume through the surface. The momentum density in the ﬁelds is evidently g = μ0.0S = .0(E × B), (8.29) and the momentum ﬂux transported by the ﬁelds is − ↔ T (speciﬁcally, − ↔ T · da is the electromagnetic momentum per unit time passing through the area da). If the mechanical momentum in V is not changing (for example, if we are talking about a region of empty space), then √ ∂g ∂t dτ = ∮ ↔ T · da = √ ∇ · ↔ T dτ, and hence ∂g ∂t = ∇ · ↔ T . (8.30) This is the “continuity equation” for electromagnetic momentum, with g (momen- tum density) in the role of ρ (charge density) and − ↔ T playing the part of J;it expresses the local conservation of ﬁeld momentum. But in general (when there are charges around) the ﬁeld momentum by itself, and the mechanical momentum by itself, are not conserved—charges and ﬁelds exchange momentum, and only the total is conserved. Notice that the Poynting vector has appeared in two quite different roles: S itself is the energy per unit area, per unit time, transported by the electromagnetic ﬁelds, while μ0.0S is the momentum per unit volume stored in those ﬁelds.6 5Let’s assume the only forces acting are electromagnetic. You can include other forces if you like— both here and in the discussion of energy conservation—but they are just a distraction from the essen- tial story. 6This is no coincidence—see R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1964), Vol. II, Section 27-6. 368 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws Similarly, ↔ T plays a dual role: ↔ T itself is the electromagnetic stress (force per unit area) acting on a surface, and − ↔ T describes the ﬂow of momentum (it is the momentum current density) carried by the ﬁelds. Example 8.3. A long coaxial cable, of length l, consists of an inner conductor (radius a) and an outer conductor (radius b). It is connected to a battery at one end and a resistor at the other (Fig. 8.5). The inner conductor carries a uniform charge per unit length λ, and a steady current I to the right; the outer conductor has the opposite charge and current. What is the electromagnetic momentum stored in the ﬁelds? −−−−−− −−−−−− I I I l V a b − +++++++ +++++++ − z R FIGURE 8.5 Solution The ﬁelds are E = 1 2π.0 λ s ˆs, B = μ0 2π I s ˆφ. The Poynting vector is therefore S = λI 4π 2.0s2 ˆz. So energy is ﬂowing down the line, from the battery to the resistor. In fact, the power transported is P = √ S · da = λI 4π 2.0 √ b a 1 s2 2π sds = λI 2π.0 ln(b/a) = IV, as it should be. The momentum in the ﬁelds is p = μ0.0 √ S dτ = μ0λI 4π 2 ˆz √ b a 1 s2 l2π sds = μ0λIl 2π ln(b/a) ˆz = IV l c2 ˆz. This is an astonishing result. The cable is not moving, E and B are static, and yet we are asked to believe that there is momentum in the ﬁelds. If something tells 8.2 Momentum 369 you this cannot be the whole story, you have sound intuitions. But the resolution of this paradox will have to await Chapter 12 (Ex. 12.12). Suppose now that we turn up the resistance, so the current decreases. The changing magnetic ﬁeld will induce an electric ﬁeld (Eq. 7.20): E = [ μ0 2π dI dt ln s + K ] ˆz. This ﬁeld exerts a force on ±λ: F = λl [ μ0 2π dI dt ln a + K ] ˆz − λl [ μ0 2π dI dt ln b + K ] ˆz =− μ0λl 2π dI dt ln(b/a) ˆz. The total momentum imparted to the cable, as the current drops from I to 0, is therefore pmech = √ F dt = μ0λIl 2π ln(b/a) ˆz, which is precisely the momentum originally stored in the ﬁelds. Problem 8.5 Imagine two parallel inﬁnite sheets, carrying uniform surface charge +σ (on the sheet at z = d)and −σ (at z = 0). They are moving in the y direction at constant speed v (as in Problem 5.17). (a) What is the electromagnetic momentum in a region of area A? (b) Now suppose the top sheet moves slowly down (speed u) until it reaches the bot- tom sheet, so the ﬁelds disappear. By calculating the total force on the charge (q = σ A), show that the impulse delivered to the sheet is equal to the mo- mentum originally stored in the ﬁelds. [Hint: As the upper plate passes by, the magnetic ﬁeld drops to zero, inducing an electric ﬁeld that delivers an impulse to the lower plate.] Problem 8.6 A charged parallel-plate capacitor (with uniform electric ﬁeld E = E ˆz) is placed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B = B ˆx, as shown in Fig. 8.6. z y x d B H = = B FIGURE 8.6 370 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws (a) Find the electromagnetic momentum in the space between the plates. (b) Now a resistive wire is connected between the plates, along the z axis,sothat the capacitor slowly discharges. The current through the wire will experience a magnetic force; what is the total impulse delivered to the system, during the discharge?7 Problem 8.7 Consider an inﬁnite parallel-plate capacitor, with the lower plate (at z =−d/2) carrying surface charge density −σ , and the upper plate (at z =+d/2) carrying charge density +σ . (a) Determine all nine elements of the stress tensor, in the region between the plates. Display your answer as a 3 × 3matrix: ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Txx Txy Txz Tyx Tyy Tyz Tzx Tzy Tzz ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (b) Use Eq. 8.21 to determine the electromagnetic force per unit area on the top plate. Compare Eq. 2.51. (c) What is the electromagnetic momentum per unit area, per unit time, crossing the xy plane (or any other plane parallel to that one, between the plates)? (d) Of course, there must be mechanical forces holding the plates apart—perhaps the capacitor is ﬁlled with insulating material under pressure. Suppose we sud- denly remove the insulator; the momentum ﬂux (c) is now absorbed by the plates, and they begin to move. Find the momentum per unit time delivered to the top plate (which is to say, the force acting on it) and compare your answer to (b). [Note: This is not an additional force, but rather an alternative way of calculating the same force—in (b) we got it from the force law, and in (d) we do it by conservation of momentum.] 8.2.4 Angular Momentum By now, the electromagnetic ﬁelds (which started out as mediators of forces between charges) have taken on a life of their own. They carry energy (Eq. 8.5) u = 1 2 ( .0 E 2 + 1 μ0 B2) , (8.31) and momentum (Eq. 8.29) g = .0(E × B), (8.32) 7There is much more to be said about this problem, so don’t get too excited if your answers to (a) and (b) appear to be consistent. See D. Babson, et al., Am.J.Phys. 77, 826 (2009). 8.2 Momentum 371 and, for that matter, angular momentum: ℓℓℓ = r × g = .0 [r × (E × B)] . (8.33) Even perfectly static ﬁelds can harbor momentum and angular momentum, as long as E × B is nonzero, and it is only when these ﬁeld contributions are included that the conservation laws are sustained. Example 8.4. Imagine a very long solenoid with radius R, n turns per unit length, and current I . Coaxial with the solenoid are two long cylindrical (non- conducting) shells of length l—one, inside the solenoid at radius a, carries a charge +Q, uniformly distributed over its surface; the other, outside the solenoid at radius b, carries charge −Q (see Fig. 8.7; l is supposed to be much greater than b). When the current in the solenoid is gradually reduced, the cylinders begin to rotate, as we found in Ex. 7.8. Question: Where does the angular momentum come from? 8 z R lb +Q −Q I φ a FIGURE 8.7 Solution It was initially stored in the ﬁelds. Before the current was switched off, there was an electric ﬁeld, E = Q 2π.0l 1 s ˆs (a < s < b), in the region between the cylinders, and a magnetic ﬁeld, B = μ0nI ˆz (s < R), 8This is a variation on the “Feynman disk paradox” (R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures, vol 2, pp. 17-5 (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1964) suggested by F. L. Boos, Jr. (Am. J. Phys. 52, 756 (1984)). A similar model was proposed earlier by R. H. Romer (Am. J. Phys. 34, 772 (1966)). For further references, see T.-C. E. Ma, Am. J. Phys. 54, 949 (1986). 372 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws inside the solenoid. The momentum density (Eq. 8.29) was therefore g =− μ0nI Q 2πls ˆφ, in the region a < s < R.The z component of the angular momentum density was (r × g)z =− μ0nI Q 2πl , which is constant (independent of s). To get the total angular momentum in the ﬁelds, we simply multiply by the volume, π(R2 − a2)l:9 L =− 1 2 μ0nI Q(R2 − a2) ˆz. (8.34) When the current is turned off, the changing magnetic ﬁeld induces a circum- ferential electric ﬁeld, given by Faraday’s law: E = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎩ − 1 2 μ0n dI dt R2 s ˆφ,(s > R), − 1 2 μ0n dI dt s ˆφ,(s < R). Thus the torque on the outer cylinder is Nb = r × (−QE) = 1 2 μ0nQ R2 dI dt ˆz, and it picks up an angular momentum Lb = 1 2 μ0nQ R2 ˆz √ 0 I dI dt dt =− 1 2 μ0nI Q R2 ˆz. Similarly, the torque on the inner cylinder is Na =− 1 2 μ0nQa2 dI dt ˆz, and its angular momentum increase is La = 1 2 μ0nI Qa2 ˆz. So it all works out: Lem = La + Lb. The angular momentum lost by the ﬁelds is precisely equal to the angular momentum gained by the cylinders, and the total angular momentum (ﬁelds plus matter) is conserved. 9The radial component integrates to zero, by symmetry. 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work 373 Problem 8.8 In Ex. 8.4, suppose that instead of turning off the magnetic ﬁeld (by reducing I ) we turn off the electric ﬁeld, by connecting a weakly10 conducting radial spoke between the cylinders. (We’ll have to cut a slot in the solenoid, so the cylinders can still rotate freely.) From the magnetic force on the current in the spoke, determine the total angular momentum delivered to the cylinders, as they discharge (they are now rigidly connected, so they rotate together). Compare the initial angular momentum stored in the ﬁelds (Eq. 8.34). (Notice that the mechanism by which angular momentum is transferred from the ﬁelds to the cylinders is entirely different in the two cases: in Ex. 8.4 it was Faraday’s law, but here it is the Lorentz force law.) Problem 8.9 Two concentric spherical shells carry uniformly distributed charges +Q (at radius a)and −Q (at radius b > a). They are immersed in a uniform mag- netic ﬁeld B = B0 ˆz. (a) Find the angular momentum of the ﬁelds (with respect to the center). (b) Now the magnetic ﬁeld is gradually turned off. Find the torque on each sphere, and the resulting angular momentum of the system. Problem 8.10 11 Imagine an iron sphere of radius R that carries a charge Q and a! uniform magnetization M = M ˆz. The sphere is initially at rest. (a) Compute the angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic ﬁelds. (b) Suppose the sphere is gradually (and uniformly) demagnetized (perhaps by heating it up past the Curie point). Use Faraday’s law to determine the induced electric ﬁeld, ﬁnd the torque this ﬁeld exerts on the sphere, and calculate the total angular momentum imparted to the sphere in the course of the demagneti- zation. (c) Suppose instead of demagnetizing the sphere we discharge it, by connecting a grounding wire to the north pole. Assume the current ﬂows over the surface in such a way that the charge density remains uniform. Use the Lorentz force law to determine the torque on the sphere, and calculate the total angular momentum imparted to the sphere in the course of the discharge. (The magnetic ﬁeld is discontinuous at the surface . . . does this matter?) [Answer: 2 9 μ0 MQ R2] 8.3 MAGNETIC FORCES DO NO WORK 12 This is perhaps a good place to revisit the old paradox that magnetic forces do no work (Eq. 5.11). What about that magnetic crane lifting the carcass of a junked car? Somebody is doing work on the car, and if it’s not the magnetic ﬁeld, who 10In Ex. 8.4 we turned the current off slowly, to keep things quasistatic; here we reduce the electric ﬁeld slowly to keep the displacement current negligible. 11This version of the Feynman disk paradox was proposed by N. L. Sharma (Am.J.Phys. 56, 420 (1988)); similar models were analyzed by E. M. Pugh and G. E. Pugh, Am. J. Phys. 35, 153 (1967) andbyR.H.Romer, Am. J. Phys. 35, 445 (1967). 12This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. I include it for those readers who are disturbed by the notion that magnetic forces do no work. 374 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws Magnet B ω aλ FIGURE 8.8 is it? The car is ferromagnetic; in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld, it contains a lot of microscopic magnetic dipoles (spinning electrons, actually), all lined up. The resulting magnetization is equivalent to a bound current running around the surface, so let’s model the car as a circular current loop—in fact, let’s make it an insulating ring of line charge λ rotating at angular velocity ω (Fig. 8.8). The upward magnetic force on the loop is (Eq. 6.2) F = 2π IaBs, (8.35) where Bs is the radial component of the magnet’s ﬁeld,13 and I = λωa. If the ring rises a distance dz (while the magnet itself stays put), the work done on it is dW = 2πa2λωBs dz. (8.36) This increases the potential energy of the ring. Who did the work? Naively, it ap- pears that the magnetic ﬁeld is responsible, but we have already learned (Ex. 5.3) that this is not the case—as the ring rises, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the net velocity of the charges in the ring, so it does no work on them. At the same time, however, a motional emf is induced in the ring, which opposes the ﬂow of charge, and hence reduces its angular velocity: E =− d\u000e dt . Here d\u000e is the ﬂux through the “ribbon” joining the ring at time t to the ring at time t + dt (Fig. 8.9): d\u000e = Bs 2πadz. dz FIGURE 8.9 13Note that the ﬁeld has to be nonuniform, or it won’t lift the car at all. 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work 375 Now E = ∮ f · dl = f (2πa), where f is the force per unit charge. So f =−Bs dz dt , (8.37) the force on a segment of length dl is f λ dl, the torque on the ring is N = a ( −Bs dz dt ) λ(2πa), and the work done (slowing the rotation) is Ndφ = N ω dt,or dW =−2πa2λωBs dz. (8.38) The ring slows down, and the rotational energy it loses (Eq. 8.38) is precisely equal to the potential energy it gains (Eq. 8.36). All the magnetic ﬁeld did was convert energy from one form to another. If you’ll permit some sloppy language, the work done by the vertical component of the magnetic force (Eq. 8.35) is equal and opposite to the work done by its horizontal component (Eq. 8.37). 14 What about the magnet? Is it completely passive in this process? Suppose we model it as a big circular loop (radius b), resting on a table and carrying a current Ib; the “junk car” is a relatively small current loop (radius a), on the ﬂoor directly below, carrying a current Ia (Fig. 8.10). This time, just for a change, let’s assume both currents are constant (we’ll include a regulated power supply in each loop15). Parallel currents attract, and we propose to lift the small loop off the ﬂoor, keeping careful track of the work done and the agency responsible. b Ib Ia h a FIGURE 8.10 14This argument is essentially the same as the one in Ex. 5.3, except that in this case I told the story in terms of motional emf, instead of the Lorentz force law. But after all, the ﬂux rule is a consequence of the Lorentz force law. 15The lower loop could be a single spinning electron, in which case quantum mechanics ﬁxes its angular momentum at ¯h/2. It might appear that this sustains the current, with no need for a power supply. I will return to this point, but for now let’s just keep quantum mechanics out of it. 376 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws Let’s start by adjusting the currents so the small ring just “ﬂoats,” a distance h below the table, with the magnetic force exactly balancing the weight (ma g)of the little ring. I’ll let you calculate the magnetic force (Prob. 8.11): Fmag = 3π 2 μ0 Ia Ib a2b2h (b2 + h2)5/2 = ma g. (8.39) Now the loop rises an inﬁnitesimal distance dz; the work done is equal to the gain in its potential energy dWg = ma gdz = 3π 2 μ0 Ia Ib a2b2h (b2 + h2)5/2 dz. (8.40) Who did it? The magnetic ﬁeld? No! The work was done by the power supply that sustains the current in loop a (Ex. 5.3). As the loop rises, a motional emf is induced in it. The ﬂux through the loop is \u000ea = MIb, where M is the mutual inductance of the two loops: M = πμ0 2 a2b2 (b2 + h2)3/2 (Prob. 7.22). The emf is Ea =− d\u000ea dt =−Ib dM dt =−Ib dM dh dh dt =−Ib ( − 3 2 ) πμ0 2 a2b2 (b2 + h2)5/2 2h (−dz) dt . The work done by the power supply (ﬁghting against this motional emf) is dWa =−Ea Ia dt = 3π 2 μ0 Ia Ib a2b2h (b2 + h2)5/2 dz (8.41) —same as the work done in lifting the loop (Eq. 8.40). Meanwhile, however, a Faraday emf is induced in the upper loop, due to the changing ﬂux from the lower loop: \u000eb = MIa ⇒ Eb =−Ia dM dt , and the work done by the power supply in ring b (to sustain the current Ib)is dWb =−Eb Ib dt = 3π 2 μ0 Ia Ib a2b2h (b2 + h2)5/2 dz, (8.42) exactly the same as dWa. That’s embarrassing—the power supplies have done twice as much work as was necessary to lift the junk car! Where did the “wasted” 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work 377 energy go? Answer: It increased the energy stored in the ﬁelds. The energy in a system of two current-carrying loops is (see Prob. 8.12) U = 1 2 L a I 2 a + 1 2 L b I 2 b + MIa Ib, (8.43) so dU = Ia Ib dM dt dt = dWb. Remarkably, all four energy increments are the same. If we care to apportion things this way, the power supply in loop a contributes the energy necessary to lift the lower ring, while the power supply in loop b provides the extra energy for the ﬁelds. If all we’re interested in is the work done to raise the ring, we can ignore the upper loop (and the energy in the ﬁelds) altogether. In both these models, the magnet itself was stationary. That’s like lifting a paper clip by holding a magnet over it. But in the case of the magnetic crane, the car stays in contact with the magnet, which is attached to a cable that lifts the whole works. As a model, we might stick the upper loop in a big box, the lower loop in a little box, and crank up the currents so the force of attraction is much greater than ma g; the two boxes snap together, and we attach a string to the upper box and pull up on it (Fig. 8.11). The same old mechanism (Ex. 5.3) prevails: as the lower loop rises, the mag- netic force tilts backwards; its vertical component lifts the loop, but its horizontal component opposes the current, and no net work is done. This time, however, the motional emf is perfectly balanced by the Faraday emf ﬁghting to keep the current going—the ﬂux through the lower loop is not changing. (If you like, the ﬂux is increasing because the loop is moving upward, into a region of higher magnetic ﬁeld, but it is decreasing because the magnetic ﬁeld of the upper loop—at any give point in space—is decreasing as that loop moves up.) No power supply is needed to sustain the current (and for that matter, no power supply is required in the upper loop either, since the energy in the ﬁelds is not changing. Who did the work to lift the car? The person pulling up on the rope, obviously. The role of the magnetic ﬁeld was merely to transmit this energy to the car, via the vertical component of the magnetic force. But the magnetic ﬁeld itself (as always) did no work. FIGURE 8.11 378 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws The fact that magnetic ﬁelds do no work follows directly from the Lorentz force law, so if you think you have discovered an exception, you’re going to have to explain why that law is incorrect. For example, if magnetic monopoles exist, the force on a particle with electric charge qe and magnetic charge qm becomes (Prob. 7.38): F = qe(E + v × B) + qm (B − .0μ0v × E) . (8.44) In that case, magnetic ﬁelds can do work ...but only on magnetic charges.So unless your car is made of monopoles (I don’t think so), this doesn’t solve the problem. A somewhat less radical possibility is that in addition to electric charges there exist permanent point magnetic dipoles (electrons?), whose dipole moment m is not associated with any electric current, but simply is. The Lorentz force law acquires an extra term F = q(E + v × B) + ∇(m · B). The magnetic ﬁeld can do work on these “intrinsic” dipoles (which experience no motional or Faraday emf, since they enclose no ﬂux). I don’t know whether a consistent theory can be constructed in this way, but in any event it is not classical electrodynamics, which is predicated on Ampère’s assumption that all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion, and point magnetic dipoles must be interpreted as the limits of tiny current loops. Problem 8.11 Derive Eq. 8.39. [Hint: Treat the lower loop as a magnetic dipole.] Problem 8.12 Derive Eq. 8.43.

Coaxial with the solenoid, at radius b ≫ a, is a circular ring of wire, with resistance R. When the current in the solenoid is (gradually) decreased, a current Ir is induced in the ring. (a) Calculate Ir , in terms of dIs/dt. (b) The power (I 2 r R) delivered to the ring must have come from the solenoid. Con- ﬁrm this by calculating the Poynting vector just outside the solenoid (the elec- tric ﬁeld is due to the changing ﬂux in the solenoid; the magnetic ﬁeld is due to the current in the ring). Integrate over the entire surface of the solenoid, and check that you recover the correct total power. 16For extensive discussion, see M. A. Heald, Am.J.Phys. 56, 540 (1988). 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work 379 Problem 8.14 An inﬁnitely long cylindrical tube, of radius a, moves at constant speed v along its axis. It carries a net charge per unit length λ, uniformly distributed over its surface. Surrounding it, at radius b, is another cylinder, moving with the same velocity but carrying the opposite charge (−λ). Find: (a) The energy per unit length stored in the ﬁelds. (b) The momentum per unit length in the ﬁelds. (c) The energy per unit time transported by the ﬁelds across a plane perpendicular to the cylinders. Problem 8.15 A point charge q is located at the center of a toroidal coil of rectan- gular cross section, inner radius a, outer radius a + w, and height h, which carries a total of N tightly-wound turns and current I . (a) Find the electromagnetic momentum p of this conﬁguration, assuming that w and h are both much less than a (so you can ignore the variation of the ﬁelds over the cross section). (b) Now the current in the toroid is turned off, quickly enough that the point charge does not move appreciably as the magnetic ﬁeld drops to zero. Show that the impulse imparted to q is equal to the momentum originally stored in the elec- tromagnetic ﬁelds.

Find the electromagnetic momentum of this conﬁguration.

(a) Calculate the total energy contained in the electromagnetic ﬁelds. (b) Calculate the total angular momentum contained in the ﬁelds. (c) According to the Einstein formula (E = mc2), the energy in the ﬁelds should contribute to the mass of the electron. Lorentz and others speculated that the entire mass of the electron might be accounted for in this way: Uem = mec2. Suppose, moreover, that the electron’s spin angular momentum is entirely attributable to the electromagnetic ﬁelds: L em = ¯h/2. On these two assump- tions, determine the radius and angular velocity of the electron. What is their product, ω R? Does this classical model make sense? Problem 8.18 Work out the formulas for u, S, g,and ↔ T in the presence of magnetic charge. [Hint: Start with the generalized Maxwell equations (7.44) and Lorentz force law (Eq. 8.44), and follow the derivations in Sections 8.1.2, 8.2.2, and 8.2.3.] 17For an interesting discussion and references, see R.

The ﬁeld of the electric charge is E = 1 4π.0 qe r2 ˆr (of course), and the ﬁeld of the magnetic monopole is B = μ0 4π qm r2 ˆr. Find the total angular momentum stored in the ﬁelds, if the two charges are sepa- rated by a distance d.[Answer: (μ0/4π)qeqm.]20 Problem 8.20 Consider an ideal stationary magnetic dipole m in a static electric ﬁeld E. Show that the ﬁelds carry momentum p =−.0μ0(m × E). (8.45) [Hint: There are several ways to do this. The simplest method is to start with p = .0 ∫ (E × B) dτ , write E =−∇V , and use integration by parts to show that p = .0μ0 √ V J dτ. So far, this is valid for any localized static conﬁguration. For a current conﬁned to an inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of the origin we can approximate V (r) ≈ V (0) − E(0) · r. Treat the dipole as a current loop, and use Eqs. 5.82 and 1.108.] 21 Problem 8.21 Because the cylinders in Ex. 8.4 are left rotating (at angular veloci- ties ωa and ωb, say), there is actually a residual magnetic ﬁeld, and hence angular momentum in the ﬁelds, even after the current in the solenoid has been extinguished. If the cylinders are heavy, this correction will be negligible, but it is interesting to do the problem without making that assumption.22 (a) Calculate (in terms of ωa and ωb) the ﬁnal angular momentum in the ﬁelds. [Deﬁne ωωω = ω ˆz,so ωa and ωb could be positive or negative.] (b) As the cylinders begin to rotate, their changing magnetic ﬁeld induces an extra azimuthal electric ﬁeld, which, in turn, will make an additional contribution to 19This system is known as Thomson’s dipole. See I. Adawi, Am.J.Phys. 44, 762 (1976) and Phys. Rev. D31, 3301 (1985), and K. R. Brownstein, Am.J.Phys. 57, 420 (1989), for discussion and refer- ences. 20Note that this result is independent of the separation distance d! It points from qe toward qm .In quantum mechanics, angular momentum comes in half-integer multiples of ¯h, so this result suggests that if magnetic monopoles exist, electric and magnetic charge must be quantized: μ0qeqm /4π = n ¯h/2, for n = 1, 2, 3,..., an idea ﬁrst proposed by Dirac in 1931. If even one monopole is lurking somewhere in the universe, this would “explain” why electric charge comes in discrete units. (How- ever, see D. Singleton, Am.J.Phys. 66, 697 (1998) for a cautionary note.) 21As it stands, Eq. 8.45 is valid only for ideal dipoles. But g is linear in B, and therefore, if E is held ﬁxed, obeys the superposition principle: For a collection of magnetic dipoles, the total momentum is the (vector) sum of the momenta for each one separately. In particular, if E is uniform over a localized steady current distribution, then Eq. 8.45 is valid for the whole thing, only now m is the total magnetic dipole moment. 22This problem was suggested by Paul DeYoung. 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work 381 the torques.

Find the linear momen- tum and the angular momentum (with respect to the origin) in the ﬁelds.

Phys. 33, 873 (2012), for discussion of this and related problems. 24Refer to Sect. 4.4.3 for the meaning of “energy” in this context. 25For over 100 years there has been a raging debate (still not completely resolved) as to whether the ﬁeld momentum in polarizable/magnetizable media is Eq. 8.48 (Minkowski’s candidate) or .0μ0 (E × H) (Abraham’s). See D. J. Grifﬁths, Am.J.Phys. 80, 7 (2012). 26This cute problem is due to K. T. McDonald, http://puhep1.princeton.edu/mcdonald/examles/ disk.pdf (who draws a somewhat different conclusion). CHAPTER 9 Electromagnetic Waves 9.1 WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION 9.1.1 The Wave Equation What is a “wave”? I don’t think I can give you an entirely satisfactory answer—the concept is intrinsically somewhat vague—but here’s a start: A wave is a distur- bance of a continuous medium that propagates with a ﬁxed shape at constant ve- locity. Immediately I must add qualiﬁers: In the presence of absorption, the wave will diminish in size as it moves; if the medium is dispersive, different frequencies travel at different speeds; in two or three dimensions, as the wave spreads out, its amplitude will decrease; and of course standing waves don’t propagate at all. But these are reﬁnements; let’s start with the simple case: ﬁxed shape, constant speed (Fig. 9.1). How would you represent such an object mathematically? In the ﬁgure, I have drawn the wave at two different times, once at t = 0, and again at some later time t—each point on the wave form simply shifts to the right by an amount vt, where v is the velocity. Maybe the wave is generated by shaking one end of a taut string; f (z, t) represents the displacement of the string at the point z,attime t. Given the initial shape of the string, g(z) ≡ f (z, 0), what is the subsequent form, f (z, t)? Well, the displacement at point z, at the later time t, is the same as the displacement a distance vt to the left (i.e. at z − vt), back at time t = 0: f (z, t) = f (z − vt, 0) = g(z − vt). (9.1) That statement captures (mathematically) the essence of wave motion. It tells us that the function f (z, t), which might have depended on z and t in any old way, in fact depends on them only in the very special combination z − vt; when that vt f v z f(z, 0) f(z, t) FIGURE 9.1 382 9.1 Waves in One Dimension 383 θ′ z z T T f z + Δz θ FIGURE 9.2 is true, the function f (z, t) represents a wave of ﬁxed shape traveling in the z direction at speed v. For example, if A and b are constants (with the appropriate units), f1(z, t) = Ae−b(z−vt)2 , f2(z, t) = A sin[b(z − vt)], f3(z, t) = A b(z − vt)2 + 1 all represent waves (with different shapes, of course), but f4(z, t) = Ae−b(bz2+vt), and f5(z, t) = A sin(bz) cos(bvt) 3, do not. Why does a stretched string support wave motion? Actually, it follows from Newton’s second law. Imagine a very long string under tension T . If it is displaced from equilibrium, the net transverse force on the segment between z and z + (z (Fig. 9.2) is (F = T sin θ ˙ − T sin θ, where θ ˙ is the angle the string makes with the z-direction at point z + (z, and θ is the corresponding angle at point z. Provided that the distortion of the string is not too great, these angles are small (the ﬁgure is exaggerated, obviously), and we can replace the sine by the tangent: (F ∼= T (tan θ ˙ − tan θ) = T √ ∂ f ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣z+(z − ∂ f ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣z ) ∼= T ∂ 2 f ∂z2 (z. If the mass per unit length is μ, Newton’s second law says (F = μ((z) ∂ 2 f ∂t 2 , and therefore ∂ 2 f ∂z2 = μ T ∂ 2 f ∂t 2 . 384 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves Evidently, small disturbances on the string satisfy ∂ 2 f ∂z2 = 1 v2 ∂ 2 f ∂t 2 , (9.2) where v (which, as we’ll soon see, represents the speed of propagation) is v = √ T μ . (9.3) Equation 9.2 is known as the (classical) wave equation, because it admits as solutions all functions of the form f (z, t) = g(z − vt), (9.4) (that is, all functions that depend on the variables z and t in the special combi- nation u ≡ z − vt), and we have just learned that such functions represent waves propagating in the z direction with speed v. For Eq. 9.4 means ∂ f ∂z = dg du ∂u ∂z = dg du , ∂ f ∂t = dg du ∂u ∂t =−v dg du , and ∂ 2 f ∂z2 = ∂ ∂z √ dg du ) = d 2g du2 ∂u ∂z = d 2g du2 , ∂ 2 f ∂t 2 =−v ∂ ∂t √ dg du ) =−v d 2g du2 ∂u ∂t = v2 d 2g du2 , so d 2g du2 = ∂ 2 f ∂z2 = 1 v2 ∂ 2 f ∂t 2 . □ Note that g(u) can be any (differentiable) function whatever. If the disturbance propagates without changing its shape, then it satisﬁes the wave equation. But functions of the form g(z − vt) are not the only solutions. The wave equa- tion involves the square of v, so we can generate another class of solutions by simply changing the sign of the velocity: f (z, t) = h(z + vt). (9.5) This, of course, represents a wave propagating in the negative z direction, and it is certainly reasonable (on physical grounds) that such solutions would be allowed. What is perhaps surprising is that the most general solution to the wave equation is the sum of a wave to the right and a wave to the left: f (z, t) = g(z − vt) + h(z + vt). (9.6) 9.1 Waves in One Dimension 385 (Notice that the wave equation is linear: The sum of any two solutions is itself a solution.) Every solution to the wave equation can be expressed in this form. Like the simple harmonic oscillator equation, the wave equation is ubiquitous in physics. If something is vibrating, the oscillator equation is almost certainly responsible (at least, for small amplitudes), and if something is waving (whether the context is mechanics or acoustics, optics or oceanography), the wave equation (perhaps with some decoration) is bound to be involved. Problem 9.1 By explicit differentiation, check that the functions f1, f2,and f3 in the text satisfy the wave equation. Show that f4 and f5 do not. Problem 9.2 Show that the standing wave f (z, t) = A sin(kz) cos(kvt) satisﬁes the wave equation, and express it as the sum of a wave traveling to the left and a wave traveling to the right (Eq. 9.6). 9.1.2 Sinusoidal Waves (i) Terminology. Of all possible wave forms, the sinusoidal one f (z, t) = A cos[k(z − vt) + δ] (9.7) is (for good reason) the most familiar. Figure 9.3 shows this function at time t = 0. A is the amplitude of the wave (it is positive, and represents the maximum dis- placement from equilibrium). The argument of the cosine is called the phase, and δ is the phase constant (obviously, you can add any integer multiple of 2π to δ without changing f (z, t); ordinarily, one uses a value in the range 0 ≤ δ< 2π). Notice that at z = vt − δ/k, the phase is zero; let’s call this the “central maxi- mum.” If δ = 0, the central maximum passes the origin at time t = 0; more gen- erally, δ/k is the distance by which the central maximum (and therefore the entire wave) is “delayed.” Finally, k is the wave number; it is related to the wavelength λ by the equation λ = 2π k , (9.8) for when z advances by 2π/k, the cosine executes one complete cycle. f (z, 0) δ/k λ A v z Central maximum FIGURE 9.3 386 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves As time passes, the entire wave train proceeds to the right, at speed v.Atany ﬁxed point z, the string vibrates up and down, undergoing one full cycle in a period T = 2π kv . (9.9) The frequency ν (number of oscillations per unit time) is ν = 1 T = kv 2π = v λ . (9.10) For our purposes, a more convenient unit is the angular frequency ω, so-called because in the analogous case of uniform circular motion, it represents the number of radians swept out per unit time: ω = 2πν = kv. (9.11) Ordinarily, it’s nicer to write sinusoidal waves (Eq. 9.7) in terms of ω, rather than v: f (z, t) = A cos(kz − ωt + δ). (9.12) A sinusoidal oscillation of wave number k and (angular) frequency ω traveling to the left would be written f (z, t) = A cos (kz + ωt − δ). (9.13) The sign of the phase constant is chosen for consistency with our previous con- vention that δ/k shall represent the distance by which the wave is “delayed” (since the wave is now moving to the left, a delay means a shift to the right). At t = 0, the wave looks like Fig. 9.4. Because the cosine is an even function, we can just as well write Eq. 9.13 thus: f (z, t) = A cos(−kz − ωt + δ). (9.14) Comparison with Eq. 9.12 reveals that, in effect, we could simply switch the sign of k to produce a wave with the same amplitude, phase constant, frequency, and wavelength, traveling in the opposite direction. f (z, 0) δ/k v z Central maximum FIGURE 9.4 9.1 Waves in One Dimension 387 (ii) Complex notation. In view of Euler’s formula, eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ, (9.15) the sinusoidal wave (Eq. 9.12) can be written f (z, t) = Re [Aei(kz−ωt+δ)] , (9.16) where Re(ξ ) denotes the real part of the complex number ξ . This invites us to introduce the complex wave function ˜f (z, t) ≡ ˜Aei(kz−ωt), (9.17) with the complex amplitude ˜A ≡ Aeiδ absorbing the phase constant. The actual wave function is the real part of ˜f : f (z, t) = Re[ ˜f (z, t)]. (9.18) If you know ˜f , it is a simple matter to ﬁnd f ;the advantage of the complex notation is that exponentials are much easier to manipulate than sines and cosines. Example 9.1. Suppose you want to combine two sinusoidal waves: f3 = f1 + f2 = Re( ˜f1) + Re( ˜f2) = Re( ˜f1 + ˜f2) = Re( ˜f3), with ˜f3 = ˜f1 + ˜f2. You simply add the corresponding complex wave functions, and then take the real part. In particular, if they have the same frequency and wave number, ˜f3 = ˜A1ei(kz−ωt) + ˜A2ei(kz−ωt) = ˜A3ei(kz−ωt), where ˜A3 = ˜A1 + ˜A2, or A3eiδ3 = A1eiδ1 + A2eiδ2 . (9.19) In other words, you just add the (complex) amplitudes. The combined wave still has the same frequency and wavelength, f3(z, t) = A3 cos (kz − ωt + δ3), and you can easily ﬁgure out A3 and δ3 from Eq. 9.19 (Prob. 9.3). Try doing this without using the complex notation—you will ﬁnd yourself looking up trig identities and slogging through nasty algebra. (iii) Linear combinations of sinusoidal waves. Although the sinusoidal function (Eq. 9.17) is a very special wave form, the fact is that any wave can be expressed as a linear combination of sinusoidal ones: ˜f (z, t) = ∫ ∞ −∞ ˜A(k)ei(kz−ωt) dk. (9.20) 388 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves Here ω is a function of k (Eq. 9.11), and I have allowed k to run through negative values in order to include waves going both directions. 1 The formula for ˜A(k), in terms of the initial conditions f (z, 0) and ˙f (z, 0), can be obtained from the theory of Fourier transforms (see Prob. 9.33), but the details are not relevant to my purpose here. The point is that any wave can be written as a linear combination of sinusoidal waves, and therefore if you know how sinusoidal waves behave, you know in principle how any wave behaves. So from now on, we shall conﬁne our attention to sinusoidal waves. Problem 9.3 Use Eq. 9.19 to determine A3 and δ3 in terms of A1, A2, δ1,and δ2. Problem 9.4 Obtain Eq. 9.20 directly from the wave equation, by separation of variables. 9.1.3 Boundary Conditions: Reﬂection and Transmission So far, I have assumed the string is inﬁnitely long—or at any rate long enough that we don’t need to worry about what happens to a wave when it reaches the end. As a matter of fact, what happens depends a lot on how the string is attached—that is, on the speciﬁc boundary conditions to which the wave is subject. Suppose, for instance, that the string is simply tied onto a second string. The tension T is the same for both, but the mass per unit length μ presumably is not, and hence the wave velocities v1 and v2 are different (remember, v = √T /μ). Let’s say, for convenience, that the knot occurs at z = 0. The incident wave ˜f I (z, t) = ˜AI ei(k1z−ωt),(z < 0), (9.21) coming in from the left, gives rise to a reﬂected wave ˜f R(z, t) = ˜A Rei(−k1z−ωt),(z < 0), (9.22) traveling back along string 1 (hence the minus sign in front of k1), in addition to a transmitted wave ˜fT (z, t) = ˜AT ei(k2z−ωt),(z > 0), (9.23) which continues on to the right in string 2. The incident wave f I (z, t) is a sinusoidal oscillation that extends (in principle) all the way back to z =−∞, and has been doing so for all of history. The same goes for f R and fT (except that the latter, of course, extends to z =+∞). All parts of the system are oscillating at the same frequency ω (a frequency determined by the person at z =−∞, who is shaking the string in the ﬁrst place). Since the 1This does not mean that λ and ω are negative—wavelength and frequency are always positive. If we allow negative wave numbers, then Eqs. 9.8 and 9.11 should really be written λ = 2π/|k| and ω =|k|v. 9.1 Waves in One Dimension 389 wave velocities are different in the two strings, however, the wavelengths and wave numbers are also different: λ1 λ2 = k2 k1 = v1 v2 . (9.24) Of course, this situation is pretty artiﬁcial—what’s more, with incident and re- ﬂected waves of inﬁnite extent traveling on the same piece of string, it’s going to be hard for a spectator to tell them apart. You might therefore prefer to consider an incident wave of ﬁnite extent—say, the pulse shown in Fig. 9.5. You can work out the details for yourself, if you like (Prob. 9.5). The trouble with this approach is that no ﬁnite pulse is truly sinusoidal. The waves in Fig. 9.5 may look like sine functions, but they’re not: they’re little pieces of sines, joined onto an entirely dif- ferent function (namely, zero). Like any other waves, they can be built up as linear combinations of true sinusoidal functions (Eq. 9.20), but only by putting together a whole range of frequencies and wavelengths. If you want a single incident fre- quency (as we shall in the electromagnetic case), you must let your waves extend to inﬁnity. (In practice, if you use a very long pulse, with many oscillations, it will be close to the ideal of a single frequency.) For a sinusoidal incident wave, then, the net disturbance of the string is: ˜f (z, t) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ ˜AI ei(k1z−ωt) + ˜A Rei(−k1z−ωt), for z < 0, ˜AT ei(k2z−ωt), for z > 0. (9.25) At thejoin(z = 0), the displacement just slightly to the left (z = 0 −) must equal the displacement slightly to the right (z = 0 +)—else there would be a break between the two strings. Mathematically, f (z, t) is continuous at z = 0: f (0 −, t) = f (0 +, t). (9.26) If the knot itself is of negligible mass, then the derivative of f must also be continuous: ∂ f ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣0− = ∂ f ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣0+. (9.27) f \u00021 \u00022 z (a) Incident pulse f \u00021 z (b) Reflected and transmitted pulses FIGURE 9.5 390 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves T T zz T T (a) Discontinuous slope; force on knot (b) Continuous slope; no force on knot Knot Knot FIGURE 9.6 Otherwise there would be a net force on the knot, and therefore an inﬁnite acceleration (Fig. 9.6). These boundary conditions apply directly to the real wave function f (z, t). But since the imaginary part of ˜f differs from the real part only in the replacement of cosine by sine (Eq. 9.15), it follows that the complex wave function ˜f (z, t) obeys the same rules: ˜f (0 −, t) = ˜f (0 +, t), ∂ ˜f ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣0− = ∂ ˜f ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣0+ . (9.28) When applied to Eq. 9.25, these boundary conditions determine the outgoing amplitudes ( ˜A R and ˜AT ) in terms of the incoming one ( ˜AI ): ˜AI + ˜A R = ˜AT , k1( ˜AI − ˜A R) = k2 ˜AT , from which it follows that ˜A R = √ k1 − k2 k1 + k2 ) ˜AI , ˜AT = √ 2k1 k1 + k2 ) ˜AI . (9.29) Or, in terms of the velocities (Eq. 9.24): ˜A R = √ v2 − v1 v2 + v1 ) ˜AI , ˜AT = √ 2v2 v2 + v1 ) ˜AI . (9.30) The real amplitudes and phases, then, are related by A ReiδR = √ v2 − v1 v2 + v1 ) AI eiδI , AT eiδT = √ 2v2 v2 + v1 ) AI eiδI . (9.31) If the second string is lighter than the ﬁrst (μ2 <μ1, so that v2 >v1), all three waves have the same phase angle (δR = δT = δI ), and the outgoing amplitudes are A R = √ v2 − v1 v2 + v1 ) AI , AT = √ 2v2 v2 + v1 ) AI . (9.32) If the second string is heavier than the ﬁrst (v2 <v1), the reﬂected wave is out of phase by 180 ◦ (δR + π = δT = δI ). In other words, since cos (−k1z − ωt + δI − π) =− cos (−k1z − ωt + δI ), 9.1 Waves in One Dimension 391 the reﬂected wave is “upside down.” The amplitudes in this case are A R = √ v1 − v2 v2 + v1 ) AI and AT = √ 2v2 v2 + v1 ) AI . (9.33) In particular, if the second string is inﬁnitely massive—or, what amounts to the same thing, if the ﬁrst string is simply nailed down at the end—then A R = AI and AT = 0. Naturally, in this case there is no transmitted wave—all of it reﬂects back. Problem 9.5 Suppose you send an incident wave of speciﬁed shape, gI (z − v1t),! down string number 1. It gives rise to a reﬂected wave, h R(z + v1t), and a transmit- ted wave, gT (z − v2t). By imposing the boundary conditions 9.26 and 9.27, ﬁnd h R and gT . Problem 9.6 (a) Formulate an appropriate boundary condition, to replace Eq. 9.27, for the case of two strings under tension T joined by a knot of mass m. (b) Find the amplitude and phase of the reﬂected and transmitted waves for the case where the knot has a mass m and the second string is massless. Problem 9.7 Suppose string 2 is embedded in a viscous medium (such as molasses),! which imposes a drag force that is proportional to its (transverse) speed: (Fdrag =−γ ∂ f ∂t (z. (a) Derive the modiﬁed wave equation describing the motion of the string. (b) Solve this equation, assuming the string vibrates at the incident frequency ω. That is, look for solutions of the form ˜f (z, t) = eiωt ˜F(z). (c) Show that the waves are attenuated (that is, their amplitude decreases with in- creasing z). Find the characteristic penetration distance, at which the amplitude is 1/e of its original value, in terms of γ, T,μ, and ω. (d) If a wave of amplitude A I , phase δI = 0, and frequency ω is incident from the left (string 1), ﬁnd the reﬂected wave’s amplitude and phase. 9.1.4 Polarization The waves that travel down a string when you shake it are called transverse, because the displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. If the string is reasonably elastic, it is also possible to stimulate compression waves, by giving the string little tugs. Compression waves are hard to see on a string, but if you try it with a slinky they’re quite noticeable (Fig. 9.7). These waves are called longitudinal, because the displacement from equilibrium is along the direction of 392 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves \u0002 FIGURE 9.7 propagation. Sound waves, which are nothing but compression waves in air, are longitudinal; electromagnetic waves, as we shall see, are transverse. Now there are, of course, two dimensions perpendicular to any given line of propagation. Accordingly, transverse waves occur in two independent states of polarization: you can shake the string up-and-down (“vertical” polarization— Fig. 9.8a), ˜fv(z, t) = ˜Aei(kz−ωt) ˆx, (9.34) or left-and-right (“horizontal” polarization—Fig. 9.8b), ˜fh(z, t) = ˜Aei(kz−ωt) ˆy, (9.35) or along any other direction in the xy plane (Fig. 9.8c): ˜f(z, t) = ˜Aei(kz−ωt) ˆn. (9.36) The polarization vector ˆn deﬁnes the plane of vibration. 2 Because the waves are transverse, ˆn is perpendicular to the direction of propagation: ˆn · ˆz = 0. (9.37) z y x (a) Vertical polarization \u0002 z y x (b) Horizontal polarization \u0002 z y x (c) Polarization vector \u0002n θ FIGURE 9.8 2Notice that you can always switch the sign of ˆn, provided you simultaneously advance the phase constant by 180◦, since both operations change the sign of the wave. 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum 393 In terms of the polarization angle θ , ˆn = cos θ ˆx + sin θ ˆy. (9.38) Thus, the wave pictured in Fig. 9.8c can be considered a superposition of two waves—one horizontally polarized, the other vertically: ˜f(z, t) = ( ˜A cos θ)ei(kz−ωt) ˆx + ( ˜A sin θ)ei(kz−ωt) ˆy. (9.39) Problem 9.8 Equation 9.36 describes the most general linearly polarized wave on a string. Linear (or “plane”) polarization (so called because the displacement is par- allel to a ﬁxed vector ˆn) results from the combination of horizontally and vertically polarized waves of the same phase (Eq. 9.39). If the two components are of equal amplitude, but out of phase by 90◦ (say, δv = 0,δh = 90 ◦), the result is a circularly polarized wave. In that case: (a) At a ﬁxed point z, show that the string moves in a circle about the z axis. Does it go clockwise or counterclockwise, as you look down the axis toward the origin? How would you construct a wave circling the other way? (In optics, the clock- wise case is called right circular polarization, and the counterclockwise, left circular polarization.)3 (b) Sketch the string at time t = 0. (c) How would you shake the string in order to produce a circularly polarized wave? 9.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN VACUUM 9.2.1 The Wave Equation for E and B In regions of space where there is no charge or current, Maxwell’s equations read (i) ∇ · E = 0,(iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × B = μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.40) They constitute a set of coupled, ﬁrst-order, partial differential equations for E and B. They can be decoupled by applying the curl to (iii) and (iv): ∇ × (∇ × E) = ∇(∇ · E) −∇2E = ∇ × √ − ∂B ∂t ) =− ∂ ∂t (∇ × B) =−μ0ϵ0 ∂ 2E ∂t 2 , 3An elegant notation for circular polarization (or elliptical, if the amplitudes are unequal) is to use a complex ˆn, but I shall not do so in this book. 394 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves ∇ × (∇ × B) = ∇(∇ · B) −∇2B = ∇ × √ μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t ) = μ0ϵ0 ∂ ∂t (∇ × E) =−μ0ϵ0 ∂ 2B ∂t 2 . Or, since ∇ · E = 0 and ∇ · B = 0, ∇2E = μ0ϵ0 ∂ 2E ∂t 2 , ∇2B = μ0ϵ0 ∂ 2B ∂t 2 . (9.41) We now have separate equations for E and B, but they are of second order; that’s the price you pay for decoupling them. In vacuum, then, each Cartesian component of E and B satisﬁes the three- dimensional wave equation, ∇2 f = 1 v2 ∂ 2 f ∂t 2 . (This is the same as Eq. 9.2, except that ∂ 2 f /∂z2 is replaced by its natural gen- eralization, ∇2 f .) So Maxwell’s equations imply that empty space supports the propagation of electromagnetic waves, traveling at a speed v = 1 √ ϵ0μ0 = 3.00 × 10 8 m/s, (9.42) which happens to be precisely the velocity of light, c. The implication is astound- ing: Perhaps light is an electromagnetic wave.4 Of course, this conclusion does not surprise anyone today, but imagine what a revelation it was in Maxwell’s time! Remember how ϵ0 and μ0 came into the theory in the ﬁrst place: they were con- stants in Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law, respectively. You measure them in experiments involving charged pith balls, batteries, and wires—experiments having nothing whatever to do with light. And yet, according to Maxwell’s the- ory, you can calculate c from these two numbers. Notice the crucial role played by Maxwell’s contribution to Ampère’s law (μ0ϵ0∂E/∂t); without it, the wave equa- tion would not emerge, and there would be no electromagnetic theory of light. 9.2.2 Monochromatic Plane Waves For reasons discussed in Sect. 9.1.2, we may conﬁne our attention to sinusoidal waves of frequency ω. Since different frequencies in the visible range correspond to different colors, such waves are called monochromatic (Table 9.1). Suppose, 4As Maxwell himself put it, “We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.” See Ivan Tolstoy, James Clerk Maxwell, A Biography (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983). 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum 395 x z y EE E E \u0002 FIGURE 9.9 moreover, that the waves are traveling in the z direction and have no x or y depen- dence; these are called plane waves,5 because the ﬁelds are uniform over every plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation (Fig. 9.9). We are interested, then, in ﬁelds of the form ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0ei(kz−ωt), ˜B(z, t) = ˜B0ei(kz−ωt), (9.43) where ˜E0 and ˜B0 are the (complex) amplitudes (the physical ﬁelds, of course, are the real parts of ˜E and ˜B), and ω = ck. Now, the wave equations for E and B (Eq. 9.41) were derived from Maxwell’s equations. However, whereas every solution to Maxwell’s equations (in empty space) must obey the wave equation, the converse is not true; Maxwell’s equa- tions impose extra constraints on ˜E0 and ˜B0. In particular, since ∇ · E = 0 and ∇ · B = 0, it follows6 that ( ˜E0)z = ( ˜B0)z = 0. (9.44) That is, electromagnetic waves are transverse: the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Moreover, Faraday’s law, ∇ × E = −∂B/∂t, implies a relation between the electric and magnetic amplitudes, to wit: −k( ˜E0)y = ω( ˜B0)x , k( ˜E0)x = ω( ˜B0)y, (9.45) or, more compactly: ˜B0 = k ω (ˆz × ˜E0). (9.46) 5For a discussion of spherical waves, at this level, see J. R. Reitz, F. J. Milford, and R. W.

Of course, over small enough regions any wave is essentially plane, as long as the wavelength is much less than the radius of the curvature of the wave front. 6Because the real part of ˜E differs from the imaginary part only in the replacement of sine by cosine, if the former obeys Maxwell’s equations, so does the latter, and hence ˜E as well. 396 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves The Electromagnetic Spectrum Frequency (Hz) Type Wavelength (m) 10 22 10 −13 10 21 gamma rays 10 −12 10 20 10 −11 10 19 10 −10 10 18 x-rays 10 −9 10 17 10 −8 10 16 ultraviolet 10 −7 10 15 visible 10−6 10 14 infrared 10 −5 10 13 10 −4 10 12 10 −3 10 11 10 −2 10 10 microwave 10 −1 10 9 1 10 8 TV, FM 10 10 7 10 2 10 6 AM 10 3 10 5 10 4 10 4 RF 10 5 10 3 10 6 The Visible Range Frequency (Hz) Color Wavelength (m) 1.0 × 10 15 near ultraviolet 3.0 × 10 −7 7.5 × 10 14 shortest visible blue 4.0 × 10 −7 6.5 × 10 14 blue 4.6 × 10 −7 5.6 × 10 14 green 5.4 × 10 −7 5.1 × 10 14 yellow 5.9 × 10 −7 4.9 × 10 14 orange 6.1 × 10 −7 3.9 × 10 14 longest visible red 7.6 × 10 −7 3.0 × 10 14 near infrared 1.0 × 10 −6 TABLE 9.1 Evidently, E and B are in phase and mutually perpendicular; their (real) ampli- tudes are related by B0 = k ω E0 = 1 c E0. (9.47) The fourth of Maxwell’s equations, ∇ × B = μ0ϵ0(∂E/∂t), does not yield an in- dependent condition; it simply reproduces Eq. 9.45. 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum 397 Example 9.2. If E points in the x direction, then B points in the y direction (Eq. 9.46): ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0ei(kz−ωt) ˆx, ˜B(z, t) = 1 c ˜E0ei(kz−ωt) ˆy, or (taking the real part) E(z, t) = E0 cos(kz − ωt + δ) ˆx, B(z, t) = 1 c E0 cos(kz − ωt + δ) ˆy. (9.48) z y x E0 E0/c E B c FIGURE 9.10 This is the paradigm for a monochromatic plane wave (see Fig. 9.10). The wave as a whole is said to be polarized in the x direction (by convention, we use the direction of E to specify the polarization of an electromagnetic wave). There is nothing special about the z direction, of course—we can easily gen- eralize to monochromatic plane waves traveling in an arbitrary direction. The no- tation is facilitated by the introduction of the propagation (or wave) vector, k, pointing in the direction of propagation, whose magnitude is the wave number k. The scalar product k · r is the appropriate generalization of kz (Fig.9.11),so ˜E(r, t) = ˜E0ei(k·r−ωt) ˆn, ˜B(r, t) = 1 c ˜E0ei(k·r−ωt)( ˆk × ˆn) = 1 c ˆk × ˜E, (9.49) where ˆn is the polarization vector. Because E is transverse, ˆn · ˆk = 0. (9.50) (The transversality of B follows automatically from Eq. 9.49.) The actual (real) electric and magnetic ﬁelds in a monochromatic plane wave with propagation vector k and polarization ˆn are 398 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves kc r k . r FIGURE 9.11 E(r, t) = E0 cos (k · r − ωt + δ) ˆn, (9.51) B(r, t) = 1 c E0 cos (k · r − ωt + δ)( ˆk × ˆn). (9.52) Problem 9.9 Write down the (real) electric and magnetic ﬁelds for a monochro- matic plane wave of amplitude E0, frequency ω, and phase angle zero that is (a) traveling in the negative x direction and polarized in the z direction; (b) traveling in the direction from the origin to the point (1, 1, 1), with polarization parallel to the xz plane. In each case, sketch the wave, and give the explicit Cartesian components of k and ˆn. 9.2.3 Energy and Momentum in Electromagnetic Waves According to Eq. 8.5, the energy per unit volume in electromagnetic ﬁelds is u = 1 2 √ ϵ0 E 2 + 1 μ0 B2) . (9.53) In the case of a monochromatic plane wave (Eq. 9.48) B2 = 1 c2 E 2 = μ0ϵ0 E 2, (9.54) so the electric and magnetic contributions are equal: u = ϵ0 E 2 = ϵ0 E 2 0 cos2 (kz − ωt + δ). (9.55) As the wave travels, it carries this energy along with it. The energy ﬂux den- sity (energy per unit area, per unit time) transported by the ﬁelds is given by the Poynting vector (Eq. 8.10): S = 1 μ0 (E × B). (9.56) For monochromatic plane waves propagating in the z direction, S = cϵ0 E 2 0 cos2 (kz − ωt + δ) ˆz = cu ˆz. (9.57) 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum 399 A c cΔt FIGURE 9.12 Notice that S is the energy density (u) times the velocity of the waves (c ˆz)—as it should be. For in a time (t, a length c (t passes through area A (Fig. 9.12), carry- ing with it an energy uAc (t. The energy per unit time, per unit area, transported by the wave is therefore uc. Electromagnetic ﬁelds not only carry energy, they also carry momentum. In fact, we found in Eq. 8.29 that the momentum density stored in the ﬁelds is g = 1 c2 S. (9.58) For monochromatic plane waves, then, g = 1 c ϵ0 E 2 0 cos2 (kz − ωt + δ) ˆz = 1 c u ˆz. (9.59) In the case of light, the wavelength is so short (∼ 5 × 10 −7 m), and the period so brief (∼ 10 −15 s), that any macroscopic measurement will encompass many cycles. Typically, therefore, we’re not interested in the ﬂuctuating cosine-squared term in the energy and momentum densities; all we want is the average value. Now, the average of cosine-squared over a complete cycle 7 is 1 2 ,so ⟨u⟩= 1 2 ϵ0 E 2 0, (9.60) ⟨S⟩= 1 2 cϵ0 E 2 0 ˆz, (9.61) ⟨g⟩= 1 2c ϵ0 E 2 0 ˆz. (9.62) I use brackets, ⟨⟩, to denote the (time) average over a complete cycle (or many cycles, if you prefer). The average power per unit area transported by an electro- magnetic wave is called the intensity: I ≡⟨S⟩= 1 2 cϵ0 E 2 0. (9.63) 7There is a cute trick for doing this in your head: sin 2 θ + cos2 θ = 1, and over a complete cycle the average of sin2 θ is equal to the average of cos2 θ ,so ⟨sin2⟩=⟨cos2⟩= 1/2. More formally, 1 T ∫ T 0 cos2 (kz − 2π t/T + δ) dt = 1/2. 400 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves When light falls (at normal incidence) on a perfect absorber, it delivers its momentum to the surface. In a time (t, the momentum transfer is (Fig. 9.12) (p =⟨g⟩Ac (t, so the radiation pressure (average force per unit area) is P = 1 A (p (t = 1 2 ϵ0 E 2 0 = I c . (9.64) (On a perfect reﬂector the pressure is twice as great, because the momentum switches direction, instead of simply being absorbed.) We can account for this pressure qualitatively, as follows: The electric ﬁeld (Eq. 9.48) drives charges in the x direction, and the magnetic ﬁeld then exerts on them a force q(v × B) in the z direction. The net force on all the charges in the surface produces the pressure.8 Problem 9.10 The intensity of sunlight hitting the earth is about 1300 W/m2.If sunlight strikes a perfect absorber, what pressure does it exert? How about a perfect reﬂector? What fraction of atmospheric pressure does this amount to? Problem 9.11 Consider a particle of charge q and mass m, free to move in the xy plane in response to an electromagnetic wave propagating in the z direction (Eq. 9.48—might as well set δ = 0). (a) Ignoring the magnetic force, ﬁnd the velocity of the particle, as a function of time. (Assume the average velocity is zero.) (b) Now calculate the resulting magnetic force on the particle. (c) Show that the (time) average magnetic force is zero. The problem with this naive model for the pressure of light is that the velocity is 90 ◦ out of phase with the ﬁelds. For energy to be absorbed, there’s got to be some resistance to the motion of the charges. Suppose we include a force of the form −γ mv, for some damping constant γ . (d) Repeat part (a) (ignore the exponentially damped transient). Repeat part (b), and ﬁnd the average magnetic force on the particle.9 Problem 9.12 In the complex notation there is a clever device for ﬁnding the time average of a product. Suppose f (r, t) = A cos (k · r − ωt + δa) and g(r, t) = B cos (k · r − ωt + δb). Show that ⟨ fg⟩= (1/2)Re( ˜f ˜g∗), where the star denotes complex conjugation. [Note that this only works if the two waves have the same k and ω, but they need not have the same amplitude or phase.] For example, ⟨u⟩= 1 4 Re √ϵ0 ˜E · ˜E∗ + 1 μ0 ˜B · ˜B∗) and ⟨S⟩= 1 2μ0 Re ( ˜E × ˜B∗) . Problem 9.13 Find all elements of the Maxwell stress tensor for a monochromatic planewavetravelinginthe z direction and linearly polarized in the x direction (Eq. 9.48). Does your answer make sense? (Remember that −↔ T represents the momentum ﬂux density.) How is the momentum ﬂux density related to the energy density, in this case? 8Actually, it’s a little more subtle than this—see Prob. 9.11. 9C. E. Mungan, Am. J. Phys. 77, 965 (2009). See also Prob. 9.34. 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter 401 9.3 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN MATTER 9.3.1 Propagation in Linear Media Inside matter, but in regions where there is no free charge or free current, Maxwell’s equations become (i) ∇ · D = 0,(iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × H = ∂D ∂t . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.65) If the medium is linear, D = ϵE, H = 1 μ B, (9.66) and homogeneous (so ϵ and μ do not vary from point to point), they reduce to (i) ∇ · E = 0,(iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × B = μϵ ∂E ∂t , ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.67) which differ from the vacuum analogs (Eqs. 9.40) only in the replacement of μ0ϵ0 by μϵ.10 Evidently electromagnetic waves propagate through a linear ho- mogeneous medium at a speed v = 1 √ϵμ = c n , (9.68) where n ≡ √ ϵμ ϵ0μ0 (9.69) is the index of refraction of the substance. For most materials, μ is very close to μ0,so n ∼= √ ϵr , (9.70) 10 This observation is mathematically pretty trivial, but the physical implications are astonishing: As the wave passes through, the ﬁelds busily polarize and magnetize all the molecules, and the resulting (oscillating) dipoles create their own electric and magnetic ﬁelds. These combine with the original ﬁelds in such a way as to create a single wave with the same frequency but a different speed. This extraordinary conspiracy (known in optics as the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem) is responsible for the phenomenon of transparency. It is a distinctly nontrivial consequence of linearity. For further discussion see M. B. James and D. J. Grifﬁths, Am. J. Phys. 60, 309 (1992); H. Fearn, D. F. V. James, and P. W. Milonni, Am. J. Phys. 64, 986 (1996); M. Mansuripur, Optics and Photonics News 9,50 (1998). 402 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves where ϵr is the dielectric constant11 (Eq. 4.34). Since ϵr is almost always greater than 1, light travels more slowly through matter—a fact that is well known from optics. All of our previous results carry over, with the simple transcription ϵ0 → ϵ, μ0 → μ, and hence c → v. The energy density is 12 u = 1 2 √ϵ E 2 + 1 μ B2) , (9.71) and the Poynting vector is S = 1 μ (E × B). (9.72) For monochromatic plane waves, the frequency and wave number are related by ω = kv (Eq. 9.11), the amplitude of B is 1/v times the amplitude of E (Eq. 9.47), and the intensity 13 is I = 1 2 ϵv E 2 0. (9.73) The interesting question is this: What happens when a wave passes from one transparent medium into another—air to water, say, or glass to plastic? As in the case of waves on a string, we expect to get a reﬂected wave and a transmitted wave. The details depend on the exact nature of the electrodynamic boundary conditions, which we derived in Chapter 7 (Eq. 7.65): (i)ϵ1 E ⊥ 1 = ϵ2 E ⊥ 2 ,(iii) E ∥ 1 = E ∥ 2, (ii) B⊥ 1 = B⊥ 2 ,(iv) 1 μ1 B ∥ 1 = 1 μ2 B ∥ 2. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (9.74) These equations relate the electric and magnetic ﬁelds just to the left and just to the right of the interface between two linear media. In the following sections, we use them to deduce the laws governing reﬂection and refraction of electromag- netic waves. 11 The dielectric constant is “constant” in the sense of being independent of the amplitude of E,but it may well depend on the frequency, as we shall see. Thus, for example, if you quote the (static) dielectric constant for water, from Table 4.2, you will conclude that the index of refraction is 8.9, which is wildly off, for visible light (n = 1.33). 12 See Prob. 8.23; refer to Sect. 4.4.3 for the precise meaning of “energy density,” in the context of linear media. 13 The momentum carried by an electromagnetic wave in matter is controversial. See, for example, S. M. Barnett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 070401 (2010). 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter 403 9.3.2 Reﬂection and Transmission at Normal Incidence Suppose the xy plane forms the boundary between two linear media. A plane wave of frequency ω, traveling in the z direction and polarized in the x direction, approaches the interface from the left (Fig. 9.13): ˜EI (z, t) = ˜E0I ei(k1z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BI (z, t) = 1 v1 ˜E0I ei(k1z−ωt) ˆy. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (9.75) It gives rise to a reﬂected wave ˜ER(z, t) = ˜E0R ei(−k1z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BR(z, t) =− 1 v1 ˜E0R ei(−k1z−ωt) ˆy, ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (9.76) which travels back to the left in medium (1), and a transmitted wave ˜ET (z, t) = ˜E0T ei(k2z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BT (z, t) = 1 v2 ˜E0T ei(k2z−ωt) ˆy, ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (9.77) which continues on to the right in medium (2). Note the minus sign in ˜BR,as required by Eq. 9.49—or, if you prefer, by the fact that the Poynting vector aims in the direction of propagation. At z = 0, the combined ﬁelds on the left, ˜EI + ˜ER and ˜BI + ˜BR, must join the ﬁelds on the right, ˜ET and ˜BT , in accordance with the boundary conditions z x y 1 2EI v1 v2 v1 BI BR BT ER ET Interface FIGURE 9.13 404 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves (Eq. 9.74). In this case there are no components perpendicular to the surface, so (i) and (ii) are trivial. However, (iii) requires that ˜E0I + ˜E0R = ˜E0T , (9.78) while (iv) says 1 μ1 √ 1 v1 ˜E0I − 1 v1 ˜E0R ) = 1 μ2 √ 1 v2 ˜E0T ) , (9.79) or ˜E0I − ˜E0R = β ˜E0T , (9.80) where β ≡ μ1v1 μ2v2 = μ1n2 μ2n1 . (9.81) Equations 9.78 and 9.80 are easily solved for the outgoing amplitudes, in terms of the incident amplitude: ˜E0R = √ 1 − β 1 + β ) ˜E0I , ˜E0T = √ 2 1 + β ) ˜E0I . (9.82) These results are strikingly similar to the ones for waves on a string. Indeed, if the permeabilities μ are close to their values in vacuum (as, remember, they are for most media), then β = v1/v2, and we have ˜E0R = √ v2 − v1 v2 + v1 ) ˜E0I , ˜E0T = √ 2v2 v2 + v1 ) ˜E0I , (9.83) which are identical to Eqs. 9.30. In that case, as before, the reﬂected wave is in phase (right side up) if v2 >v1 and out of phase (upside down) if v2 <v1;the real amplitudes are related by E0R = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ v2 − v1 v2 + v1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ E0I , E0T = √ 2v2 v2 + v1 ) E0I , (9.84) or, in terms of the indices of refraction, E0R = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n1 − n2 n1 + n2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ E0I , E0T = √ 2n1 n1 + n2 ) E0I . (9.85) What fraction of the incident energy is reﬂected, and what fraction is transmit- ted? According to Eq. 9.73, the intensity (average power per unit area) is I = 1 2 ϵv E 2 0. 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter 405 If (again) μ1 = μ2 = μ0, then the ratio of the reﬂected intensity to the incident intensity is R ≡ IR II = √ E0R E0I )2 = √ n1 − n2 n1 + n2 )2, (9.86) whereas the ratio of the transmitted intensity to the incident intensity is T ≡ IT II = ϵ2v2 ϵ1v1 √ E0T E0I )2 = 4n1n2 (n1 + n2)2 . (9.87) R is called the reﬂection coefﬁcient and T the transmission coefﬁcient;they measure the fraction of the incident energy that is reﬂected and transmitted, re- spectively. Notice that R + T = 1, (9.88) as conservation of energy, of course, requires. For instance, when light passes from air (n1 = 1) into glass (n2 = 1.5), R = 0.04 and T = 0.96. No surprise: most of the light is transmitted. Problem 9.14 Calculate the exact reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients, without assuming μ1 = μ2 = μ0. Conﬁrm that R + T = 1. Problem 9.15 In writing Eqs. 9.76 and 9.77, I tacitly assumed that the reﬂected and transmitted waves have the same polarization as the incident wave—along the x direction. Prove that this must be so. [Hint: Let the polarization vectors of the transmitted and reﬂected waves be ˆnT = cos θT ˆx + sin θT ˆy, ˆnR = cos θR ˆx + sin θR ˆy, and prove from the boundary conditions that θT = θR = 0.] 9.3.3 Reﬂection and Transmission at Oblique Incidence In the last section, I treated reﬂection and transmission at normal incidence—that is, when the incoming wave hits the interface head-on. We now turn to the more general case of oblique incidence, in which the incoming wave meets the bound- ary at an arbitrary angle θI (Fig. 9.14). Of course, normal incidence is really just a special case of oblique incidence, with θI = 0, but I wanted to treat it separately, as a kind of warm-up, because the algebra is now going to get a little heavy. Suppose, then, that a monochromatic plane wave ˜EI (r, t) = ˜E0I ei(kI ·r−ωt), ˜BI (r, t) = 1 v1 ( ˆkI × ˜EI ) (9.89) 406 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves z x kI kT kR \u0003I \u0003R \u0003T 1 2 Plane of Incidence FIGURE 9.14 approaches from the left, giving rise to a reﬂected wave, ˜ER(r, t) = ˜E0R ei(kR ·r−ωt), ˜BR(r, t) = 1 v1 ( ˆkR × ˜ER) , (9.90) and a transmitted wave ˜ET (r, t) = ˜E0T ei(kT ·r−ωt), ˜BT (r, t) = 1 v2 ( ˆkT × ˜ET ) . (9.91) All three waves have the same frequency ω—that is determined once and for all at the source (the ﬂashlight, or whatever, that produces the incident beam).14 The three wave numbers are related by Eq. 9.11: kI v1 = k Rv1 = kT v2 = ω, or kI = k R = v2 v1 kT = n1 n2 kT . (9.92) The combined ﬁelds in medium (1), ˜EI + ˜ER and ˜BI + ˜BR,mustnow be joined to the ﬁelds ˜ET and ˜BT in medium (2), using the boundary conditions (Eq. 9.74). These all share the generic structure ()ei(kI ·r−ωt) + ()ei(kR ·r−ωt) = ()ei(kT ·r−ωt), at z = 0. (9.93) I’ll ﬁll in the parentheses in a moment; for now, the important thing to notice is that the x, y, and t dependence is conﬁned to the exponents. Because the boundary conditions must hold at all points on the plane, and for all times, these exponential factors must be equal (when z = 0). Otherwise, a slight change in x, say, would destroy the equality (see Prob. 9.16). Of course, the time factors are already equal (in fact, you could regard this as a conﬁrmation that the transmitted and reﬂected frequencies must match the incident one). As for the spatial terms, evidently kI · r = kR · r = kT · r, when z = 0, (9.94) 14 Nonlinear (“active”) media can change the frequency, but we are talking only about linear media. 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter 407 or, more explicitly, x(kI )x + y(kI )y = x(k R)x + y(k R)y = x(kT )x + y(kT )y, (9.95) for all x and all y. But Eq. 9.95 can only hold if the components are separately equal, for if x = 0, we get (kI )y = (k R)y = (kT )y, (9.96) while y = 0gives (kI )x = (k R)x = (kT )x . (9.97) We may as well orient our axes so that kI lies in the xz plane (i.e. (kI )y = 0); according to Eq. 9.96, so too will kR and kT . Conclusion: First Law: The incident, reﬂected, and transmitted wave vectors form a plane (called the plane of incidence), which also includes the normal to the surface (here, the z axis). Meanwhile, Eq. 9.97 implies that kI sin θI = k R sin θR = kT sin θT , (9.98) where θI is the angle of incidence, θR is the angle of reﬂection, and θT is the angle of transmission (more commonly known as the angle of refraction), all of them measured with respect to the normal (Fig. 9.14). In view of Eq. 9.92, then, Second Law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reﬂection, θI = θR. (9.99) This is the law of reﬂection. As for the transmitted angle, Third Law: sin θT sin θI = n1 n2 . (9.100) This is the law of refraction—Snell’s law. These are the three fundamental laws of geometrical optics. It is remarkable how little actual electrodynamics went into them: we have yet to invoke any spe- ciﬁc boundary conditions—all we used was their generic form (Eq. 9.93). There- fore, any other waves (water waves, for instance, or sound waves) can be expected to obey the same “optical” laws when they pass from one medium into another. 408 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves Now that we have taken care of the exponential factors—they cancel, given Eq. 9.94—the boundary conditions (Eq. 9.74) become: (i)ϵ1 ( ˜E0I + ˜E0R ) z = ϵ2 ( ˜E0T ) z (ii) ( ˜B0I + ˜B0R ) z = ( ˜B0T ) z (iii) ( ˜E0I + ˜E0R ) x,y = ( ˜E0T ) x,y (iv) 1 μ1 ( ˜B0I + ˜B0R ) x,y = 1 μ2 ( ˜B0T ) x,y ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.101) where ˜B0 = (1/v) ˆk × ˜E0 in each case. (The last two represent pairs of equations, one for the x-component and one for the y-component.) Suppose the polarization of the incident wave is parallel to the plane of inci- dence (the xz plane); it follows (see Prob. 9.15) that the reﬂected and transmitted waves are also polarized in this plane (Fig. 9.15). (I shall leave it for you to analyze the case of polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence; see Prob. 9.17.) Then (i) reads ϵ1 ( − ˜E0I sin θI + ˜E0R sin θR) = ϵ2 (− ˜E0T sin θT ) ; (9.102) (ii) adds nothing (0 = 0), since the magnetic ﬁelds have no z components; (iii) becomes ˜E0I cos θI + ˜E0R cos θR = ˜E0T cos θT ; (9.103) z x kT kI kR ER BR EI ET BT BI \u0003I \u0003R \u0003T 1 2 FIGURE 9.15 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter 409 and (iv) says 1 μ1v1 ( ˜E0I − ˜E0R ) = 1 μ2v2 ˜E0T . (9.104) Given the laws of reﬂection and refraction, Eqs. 9.102 and 9.104 both reduce to ˜E0I − ˜E0R = β ˜E0T , (9.105) where (as before) β ≡ μ1v1 μ2v2 = μ1n2 μ2n1 , (9.106) and Eq. 9.103 says ˜E0I + ˜E0R = α ˜E0T , (9.107) where α ≡ cos θT cos θI . (9.108) Solving Eqs. 9.105 and 9.107 for the reﬂected and transmitted amplitudes, we obtain ˜E0R = √ α − β α + β ) ˜E0I , ˜E0T = √ 2 α + β ) ˜E0I . (9.109) These are known as Fresnel’s equations, for the case of polarization in the plane of incidence. (There are two other Fresnel equations, giving the reﬂected and transmitted amplitudes when the polarization is perpendicular to the plane of incidence—see Prob. 9.17.) Notice that the transmitted wave is always in phase with the incident one; the reﬂected wave is either in phase (“right side up”), if α> β, or 180 ◦ out of phase (“upside down”), if α< β.15 The amplitudes of the transmitted and reﬂected waves depend on the angle of incidence, because α is a function of θI : α = √1 − sin 2 θT cos θI = √1 −[(n1/n2) sin θI ]2 cos θI . (9.110) In the case of normal incidence (θI = 0), α = 1, and we recover Eq. 9.82. At grazing incidence (θI = 90 ◦), α diverges, and the wave is totally reﬂected (a fact 15 There is an unavoidable ambiguity in the phase of the reﬂected wave, since (as I mentioned in the footnote to Eq. 9.36) changing the sign of the polarization vector is equivalent to a 180◦ phase shift. The convention I adopted in Fig. 9.15, with ER positive “upward,” is consistent with some, but not all, of the standard optics texts. 410 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves that is painfully familiar to anyone who has driven at night on a wet road). Inter- estingly, there is an intermediate angle, θB (called Brewster’s angle), at which the reﬂected wave is completely extinguished.16 According to Eq. 9.109, this occurs when α = β,or sin 2 θB = 1 − β2 (n1/n2)2 − β2 . (9.111) For the typical case μ1 ∼= μ2,so β ∼= n2/n1,sin 2 θB ∼= β2/(1 + β2), and hence tan θB ∼= n2 n1 . (9.112) Figure 9.16 shows a plot of the transmitted and reﬂected amplitudes as functions of θI , for light incident on glass (n2 = 1.5) from air (n1 = 1). (On the graph, a negative number indicates that the wave is 180◦ out of phase with the incident beam—the amplitude itself is the absolute value.) The power per unit area striking the interface is S · ˆz. Thus the incident inten- sity is II = 1 2 ϵ1v1 E 2 0I cos θI , (9.113) while the reﬂected and transmitted intensities are IR = 1 2 ϵ1v1 E 2 0R cos θR, and IT = 1 2 ϵ2v2 E 2 0T cos θT .

That’s why Polaroid glasses, with the transmission axis vertical, help to reduce glare off a horizontal surface. 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter 411 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 θB θI 10° 30° 50° 70° 90°0° 20° 40° 60° 80° R T FIGURE 9.17 (The cosines are there because I am talking about the average power per unit area of interface, and the interface is at an angle to the wave front.)

(9.116) They are plotted as functions of the angle of incidence in Fig. 9.17 (for the air/glass interface). R is the fraction of the incident energy that is reﬂected— naturally, it goes to zero at Brewster’s angle; T is the fraction transmitted—it goes to 1 at θB. Note that R + T = 1, as required by conservation of energy: the energy per unit time reaching a particular patch of area on the surface is equal to the energy per unit time leaving the patch.

(Note that for this β the reﬂected wave is always 180◦ out of phase.) Show that there is no Brewster’s angle for any n1 and n2: ˜E0R is never zero (unless, of course, n1 = n2 and μ1 = μ2, in which case the two media are optically indistinguishable).

In partic- ular, calculate (a) the amplitudes at normal incidence, (b) Brewster’s angle, and (c) the “crossover” angle, at which the reﬂected and transmitted amplitudes are equal. 412 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves 9.4 ABSORPTION AND DISPERSION 9.4.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Conductors In Sect. 9.3 I stipulated that the free charge density ρ f and the free current density J f are zero, and everything that followed was predicated on that assumption. Such a restriction is perfectly reasonable when you’re talking about wave propagation through a vacuum or through insulating materials such as glass or (pure) water. But in the case of conductors we do not independently control the ﬂow of charge, and in general J f is certainly not zero. In fact, according to Ohm’s law, the (free) current density in a conductor is proportional to the electric ﬁeld: J f = σ E. (9.117) With this, Maxwell’s equations for linear media assume the form (i) ∇ · E = 1 ϵ ρ f ,(iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × B = μσ E + μϵ ∂E ∂t . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.118) Now, the continuity equation for free charge, ∇ · J f =− ∂ρ f ∂t , (9.119) together with Ohm’s law and Gauss’s law (i), gives ∂ρ f ∂t =−σ(∇ · E) =− σ ϵ ρ f for a homogeneous linear medium, from which it follows that ρ f (t) = e−(σ/ϵ)t ρ f (0). (9.120) Thus any initial free charge ρ f (0) dissipates in a characteristic time τ ≡ ϵ/σ .This reﬂects the familiar fact that if you put some free charge on a conductor, it will ﬂow out to the edges. The time constant τ affords a measure of how “good” a con- ductor is: For a “perfect” conductor, σ =∞ and τ = 0; for a “good” conductor, τ is much less than the other relevant times in the problem (in oscillatory systems, that means τ ≪ 1/ω); for a “poor” conductor, τ is greater than the characteris- tic times in the problem (τ ≫ 1/ω). 17 But we’re not interested in this transient 17 N. Ashby, Am. J. Phys. 43, 553 (1975), points out that for good conductors τ is absurdly short (10−19 s, for copper, whereas the time between collisions is τc = 10−14 s). The problem is that Ohm’s law itself breaks down on time scales shorter than τc; actually, the time it takes free charge to dissipate in a good conductor is of order τc, not τ . Moreover, H. C. Ohanian, Am.J.Phys. 51, 1020 (1983), shows that it takes even longer for the ﬁelds and currents to equilibrate. But none of this is relevant to our present purpose; the net free charge density in a conductor does quickly dissipate, and exactly how long the process takes is beside the point. 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion 413 behavior—we’ll wait for any accumulated free charge to disappear. From then on, ρ f = 0, and we have (i) ∇ · E = 0,(iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × B = μϵ ∂E ∂t + μσ E. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.121) These differ from the corresponding equations for nonconducting media (Eq. 9.67) only in the last term in (iv)—which is absent, obviously, when σ = 0. Applying the curl to (iii) and (iv), as before, we obtain modiﬁed wave equations for E and B: ∇2E = μϵ ∂ 2E ∂t 2 + μσ ∂E ∂t , ∇2B = μϵ ∂ 2B ∂t 2 + μσ ∂B ∂t . (9.122) These equations still admit plane-wave solutions, ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0ei( ˜kz−ωt), ˜B(z, t) = ˜B0ei( ˜kz−ωt), (9.123) but this time the “wave number” ˜k is complex: ˜k2 = μϵω2 + iμσ ω, (9.124) as you can easily check by plugging Eq. 9.123 into Eq. 9.122. Taking the square root, ˜k = k + iκ, (9.125) where k ≡ ω√ ϵμ 2 [√ 1 + ( σ ϵω )2 + 1 ]1/2 ,κ ≡ ω√ ϵμ 2 [√ 1 + ( σ ϵω )2 − 1 ]1/2 . (9.126) The imaginary part of ˜k results in an attenuation of the wave (decreasing amplitude with increasing z): ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0e−κzei(kz−ωt), ˜B(z, t) = ˜B0e−κzei(kz−ωt). (9.127) The distance it takes to reduce the amplitude by a factor of 1/e (about a third) is called the skin depth: d ≡ 1 κ ; (9.128) 414 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves it is a measure of how far the wave penetrates into the conductor. Meanwhile, the real part of ˜k determines the wavelength, the propagation speed, and the index of refraction, in the usual way: λ = 2π k ,v = ω k , n = ck ω . (9.129) The attenuated plane waves (Eq. 9.127) satisfy the modiﬁed wave equation (9.122) for any ˜E0 and ˜B0. But Maxwell’s equations (9.121) impose further con- straints, which serve to determine the relative amplitudes, phases, and polariza- tions of E and B. As before, (i) and (ii) rule out any z components: the ﬁelds are transverse. We may as well orient our axes so that E is polarized along the x direction: ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0e−κzei(kz−ωt) ˆx. (9.130) Then (iii) gives ˜B(z, t) = ˜k ω ˜E0e−κzei(kz−ωt) ˆy. (9.131) (Equation (iv) says the same thing.) Once again, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are mutually perpendicular. Like any complex number, ˜k can be expressed in terms of its modulus and phase: ˜k = Keiφ, (9.132) where K ≡| ˜k|= √k2 + κ 2 = ω √ ϵμ √ 1 + ( σ ϵω )2 (9.133) and φ ≡ tan−1(κ/k). (9.134) According to Eq. 9.130 and 9.131, the complex amplitudes ˜E0 = E0eiδE and ˜B0 = B0eiδB are related by B0eiδB = Keiφ ω E0eiδE . (9.135) Evidently the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are no longer in phase; in fact, δB − δE = φ; (9.136) the magnetic ﬁeld lags behind the electric ﬁeld. Meanwhile, the (real) amplitudes of E and B are related by B0 E0 = K ω = √ ϵμ √ 1 + ( σ ϵω )2. (9.137) 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion 415 y x z E B FIGURE 9.18 The (real) electric and magnetic ﬁelds are, ﬁnally, E(z, t) = E0e−κz cos (kz − ωt + δE ) ˆx, B(z, t) = B0e−κz cos (kz − ωt + δE + φ) ˆy. ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ (9.138) These ﬁelds are shown in Fig. 9.18.

Instead, we have the more general relations (Eq. 7.64): (i)ϵ1 E ⊥ 1 − ϵ2 E ⊥ 2 = σ f ,(iii) E ∥ 1 − E ∥ 2 = 0, (ii) B⊥ 1 − B⊥ 2 = 0,(iv) 1 μ1 B ∥ 1 − 1 μ2 B ∥ 2 = K f × ˆn, ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (9.139) where σ f (not to be confused with conductivity) is the free surface charge, K f is the free surface current, and ˆn (not to be confused with the polarization of the wave) is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing from medium (2) into medium (1). For ohmic conductors (J f = σ E) there can be no free surface current, since this would require an inﬁnite electric ﬁeld at the boundary. Suppose now that the xy plane forms the boundary between a nonconducting linear medium (1) and a conductor (2). A monochromatic plane wave, traveling in the z direction and polarized in the x direction, approaches from the left, as in Fig. 9.13: ˜EI (z, t) = ˜E0I ei(k1z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BI (z, t) = 1 v1 ˜E0I ei(k1z−ωt) ˆy. (9.140) This incident wave gives rise to a reﬂected wave, ˜ER(z, t) = ˜E0R ei(−k1z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BR(z, t) =− 1 v1 ˜E0R ei(−k1z−ωt) ˆy, (9.141) propagating back to the left in medium (1), and a transmitted wave ˜ET (z, t) = ˜E0T ei( ˜k2z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BT (z, t) = ˜k2 ω ˜E0T ei( ˜k2z−ωt) ˆy, (9.142) which is attenuated as it penetrates into the conductor. At z = 0, the combined wave in medium (1) must join the wave in medium (2), pursuant to the boundary conditions (Eq. 9.139). Since E ⊥ = 0 on both sides, boundary condition (i) yields σ f = 0. Since B⊥ = 0, (ii) is automatically satis- ﬁed. Meanwhile, (iii) gives ˜E0I + ˜E0R = ˜E0T , (9.143) 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion 417 and (iv) (with K f = 0) says 1 μ1v1 ( ˜E0I − ˜E0R ) − ˜k2 μ2ω ˜E0T = 0, (9.144) or ˜E0I − ˜E0R = ˜β ˜E0T , (9.145) where ˜β ≡ μ1v1 μ2ω ˜k2. (9.146) It follows that ˜E0R = ( 1 − ˜β 1 + ˜β ) ˜E0I , ˜E0T = √ 2 1 + ˜β ) ˜E0I . (9.147) These results are formally identical to the ones that apply at the boundary be- tween nonconductors (Eq. 9.82), but the resemblance is deceptive since ˜β is now a complex number. For a perfect conductor (σ =∞), k2 =∞ (Eq. 9.126), so ˜β is inﬁnite, and ˜E0R =− ˜E0I , ˜E0T = 0. (9.148) In this case the wave is totally reﬂected, with a 180 ◦ phase shift. (That’s why excellent conductors make good mirrors. In practice, you paint a thin coating of silver onto the back of a pane of glass—the glass has nothing to do with the reﬂection; it’s just there to support the silver and to keep it from tarnishing. Since the skin depth in silver at optical frequencies is less than 100 Å, you don’t need a very thick layer.) Problem 9.22 Calculate the reﬂection coefﬁcient for light at an air-to-silver inter- face (μ1 = μ2 = μ0,ϵ1 = ϵ0,σ = 6 × 107(\u0014 · m)−1), at optical frequencies (ω = 4 × 1015/s). 9.4.3 The Frequency Dependence of Permittivity In the preceding sections, we have seen that the propagation of electromagnetic waves through matter is governed by three properties of the material: the permit- tivity ϵ, the permeability μ, and the conductivity σ . Actually, each of these param- eters depends to some extent on the frequency of the waves you are considering. Indeed, it is well known from optics that n ∼= √ ϵr is a function of wavelength (Fig. 9.19 shows the graph for a typical glass). A prism or a raindrop bends blue light more sharply than red, and spreads white light out into a rainbow of colors. This phenomenon is called dispersion. By extension, whenever the speed of a wave depends on its frequency, the supporting medium is called dispersive. 418 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic WavesIndex of refraction Wavelength, λ (in air) 1.450 4000 5000 6000 7000 Angstroms 1.460 1.470 1.480 FIGURE 9.19 Because waves of different frequency travel at different speeds in a dispersive medium, a wave form that incorporates a range of frequencies will change shape as it propagates. A sharply peaked wave typically ﬂattens out, and whereas each sinusoidal component travels at the ordinary wave (or phase) velocity, v = ω k , (9.149) the packet as a whole (the “envelope”) moves at the so-called group velocity 18 vg = dω dk . (9.150) [You can demonstrate this by dropping a rock into the nearest pond and watching the waves that form: While the disturbance as a whole spreads out in a circle, moving at speed vg, the ripples that go to make it up will be seen to travel twice as fast (v = 2vg in this case). They appear at the back end of the packet, growing as they move forward to the center, then shrinking again and fading away at the front (Fig. 9.20).] We shall not concern ourselves with these matters—I’ll stick to monochromatic waves, for which the problem does not arise. But I should just mention that the energy carried by a wave packet in a dispersive medium does not travel at the phase velocity. Don’t be too alarmed, therefore, if in some circumstances v comes out greater than c.19 18 See A. P. French, Vibrations and Waves (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1971), p. 230, or F. S. Crawford, Jr., Waves (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1968), Sect. 6.2. 19 Even the group velocity can exceed c in special cases—see P. C. Peters, Am.J.Phys. 56, 129 (1988), or work Prob. 9.26. For delightful commentary, see C. F. Bohren, Am. J. Phys. 77, 101 (2009). And if two different “speeds of light” are not enough to satisfy you, check out S. C. Bloch, Am.J.Phys. 45, 538 (1977), in which no fewer than eight distinct velocities are identiﬁed! Indeed, it’s not clear what you mean by the “velocity” of something that changes shape as it moves, and has no precise beginning or end. Do you mean the speed at which the peak intensity propagates? Or the speed at which energy is transported? Or information transmitted? In special relativity no causal signal can travel faster than c, but some of the other “velocities” have no such restriction. 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion 419 \u0002g \u0002 FIGURE 9.20 My purpose in this section is to account for the frequency dependence of ϵ in dielectrics, using a simpliﬁed model for the behavior of the electrons. Like all classical models of atomic-scale phenomena, it is at best an approximation to the truth; nevertheless, it does yield qualitatively satisfactory results, and it provides a plausible mechanism for dispersion in transparent media. The electrons in a nonconductor are bound to speciﬁc molecules. The actual binding forces can be quite complicated, but we shall picture each electron as attached to the end of a spring, with force constant kspring (Fig. 9.21): Fbinding =−kspringx =−mω2 0x, (9.151) where x is displacement from equilibrium, m is the electron’s mass, and ω0 is the natural oscillation frequency, √kspring/m. [If this strikes you as an implausible model, look back at Ex. 4.1, where we were led to a force of precisely this form. As a matter of fact, practically any binding force can be approximated this way for sufﬁciently small displacements from equilibrium, as you can see by expanding the potential energy in a Taylor series about the equilibrium point: U (x) = U (0) + xU ˙(0) + 1 2 x 2U ˙˙(0) + ··· . The ﬁrst term is a constant, with no dynamical signiﬁcance (you can always adjust the zero of potential energy so that U (0) = 0). The second term automatically vanishes, since dU/dx =−F, and by the nature of an equilibrium, the force at that point is zero. The third term is precisely the potential energy of a spring with force constant kspring = d 2U/dx 2∣ ∣0 (the second derivative is positive, for a point of stable equilibrium). As long as the displacements are small, the higher terms in the series can be neglected. Geometrically, all I am saying is that practically any function can be ﬁt near a minimum by a suitable parabola.] z x \u0002E Electron kspring FIGURE 9.21 420 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves Meanwhile, there will presumably be some damping force on the electron: Fdamping =−mγ dx dt . (9.152) [Again I have chosen the simplest possible form; the damping must be opposite in direction to the velocity, and making it proportional to the velocity is the easiest way to accomplish this. The cause of the damping does not concern us here— among other things, an oscillating charge radiates, and the radiation siphons off energy. We will calculate this “radiation damping” in Chapter 11.] In the presence of an electromagnetic wave of frequency ω, polarized in the x direction (Fig. 9.21), the electron is subject to a driving force Fdriving = qE = qE0 cos(ωt), (9.153) where q is the charge of the electron and E0 is the amplitude of the wave at the point z where the electron is situated. (Since we’re only interested in one point, I have reset the clock so that the maximum E occurs there at t = 0. For simplicity, I assume the magnetic force is negligible.) Putting all this into Newton’s second law gives m d 2x dt 2 = Ftot = Fbinding + Fdamping + Fdriving, or m d 2x dt 2 + mγ dx dt + mω2 0x = qE0 cos(ωt). (9.154) Our model, then, describes the electron as a damped harmonic oscillator, driven at frequency ω. (The much more massive nucleus remains at rest.) Equation 9.154 is easier to handle if we regard it as the real part of a complex equation: d 2 ˜x dt 2 + γ d ˜x dt + ω2 0 ˜x = q m E0e−iωt . (9.155) In the steady state, the system oscillates at the driving frequency: ˜x(t) =˜x0e−iωt . (9.156) Inserting this into Eq. 9.155, we obtain ˜x0 = q/m ω2 0 − ω2 − iγω E0. (9.157) The resulting dipole moment is the real part of ˜p(t) = q ˜x(t) = q 2/m ω2 0 − ω2 − iγω E0e−iωt . (9.158) 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion 421 The imaginary term in the denominator means that p is out of phase with E— lagging behind by an angle tan−1[γω/(ω2 0 − ω2)] that is very small when ω ≪ ω0 and rises to π when ω ≫ ω0. In general, differently situated electrons within a given molecule experience different natural frequencies and damping coefﬁcients. Let’s say there are f j electrons with frequency ω j and damping γ j in each molecule. If there are N molecules per unit volume, the polarization P is given by 20 the real part of ˜P = Nq 2 m ⎛ ⎝ ∑ j f j ω2 j − ω2 − iγ j ω ⎞ ⎠ ˜E. (9.159) Now, I deﬁned the electric susceptibility as the proportionality constant between P and E (speciﬁcally, P = ϵ0χeE). In the present case, P is not proportional to E (this is not, strictly speaking, a linear medium) because of the difference in phase. However, the complex polarization ˜P is proportional to the complex ﬁeld ˜E, and this suggests that we introduce a complex susceptibility, ˜χe: ˜P = ϵ0 ˜χe ˜E. (9.160) All of the manipulations we went through before carry over, on the understand- ing that the physical polarization is the real part of ˜P, just as the physical ﬁeld is the real part of ˜E. In particular, the proportionality between ˜D and ˜E is the com- plex permittivity ˜ϵ = ϵ0(1 +˜χe), and the complex dielectric constant (in this model) is ˜ϵr = ˜ϵ ϵ0 = 1 + Nq 2 mϵ0 ∑ j f j ω2 j − ω2 − iγ j ω . (9.161) Ordinarily, the imaginary term is negligible; however, when ω is very close to one of the resonant frequencies (ω j ) it plays an important role, as we shall see. In a dispersive medium, the wave equation for a given frequency reads ∇2 ˜E =˜ϵμ0 ∂ 2 ˜E ∂t 2 ; (9.162) it admits plane wave solutions, as before, ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0ei( ˜kz−ωt), (9.163) with the complex wave number ˜k ≡ √˜ϵμ0 ω. (9.164) 20This applies directly to the case of a dilute gas; for denser materials the theory is modiﬁed slightly, in accordance with the Clausius-Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.41). By the way, don’t confuse the “polar- ization” of a medium, P, with the “polarization” of a wave—same word, but two completely unrelated meanings. 422 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves Writing ˜k in terms of its real and imaginary parts, ˜k = k + iκ, (9.165) Eq. 9.163 becomes ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0e−κzei(kz−ωt). (9.166) The wave is attenuated (this is hardly surprising, since the damping absorbs energy). Because the intensity is proportional to E 2 (and hence to e−2κz), the quantity α ≡ 2κ (9.167) is called the absorption coefﬁcient. Meanwhile, the wave velocity is ω/k, and the index of refraction is n = ck ω . (9.168) I have deliberately used notation reminiscent of Sect. 9.4.1. However, in the present case k and κ have nothing to do with conductivity; rather, they are deter- mined by the parameters of our damped harmonic oscillator. For gases, the second term in Eq. 9.161 is small, and we can approximate the square root (Eq. 9.164) by the ﬁrst term in the binomial expansion, √1 + ε ∼= 1 + 1 2 ε. Then ˜k = ω c √˜ϵr ∼= ω c ⎡ ⎣1 + Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j f j ω2 j − ω2 − iγ j ω ⎤ ⎦ , (9.169) so n = ck ω ∼= 1 + Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j f j ( ω2 j − ω2) ( ω2 j − ω2)2 + γ 2 j ω2 , (9.170) and α = 2κ ∼= Nq 2ω2 mϵ0c ∑ j f j γ j (ω2 j − ω2)2 + γ 2 j ω2 . (9.171) In Fig. 9.22 I have plotted the index of refraction and the absorption coefﬁcient in the vicinity of one of the resonances. Most of the time the index of refraction rises gradually with increasing frequency, consistent with our experience from optics (Fig. 9.19). However, in the immediate neighborhood of a resonance the index of refraction drops sharply. Because this behavior is atypical, it is called 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion 423 ωj –2γj ωj +2γjωjω1 ω2 α n − 1 FIGURE 9.22 anomalous dispersion. Notice that the region of anomalous dispersion (ω1 < ω< ω2, in the ﬁgure) coincides with the region of maximum absorption; in fact, the material may be practically opaque in this frequency range. The reason is that we are now driving the electrons at their “favorite” frequency; the amplitude of their oscillation is relatively large, and a correspondingly large amount of energy is dissipated by the damping mechanism. In Fig. 9.22, n runs below 1 above the resonance, suggesting that the wave speed exceeds c. As I mentioned earlier, this is no immediate cause for alarm, since energy does not travel at the wave velocity. Moreover, the graph does not include the contributions of other terms in the sum, which add a relatively con- stant “background” that, in some cases, keeps n > 1 on both sides of the reso- nance. Incidentally, the group velocity can also exceed c in the neighborhood of a resonance, in this model (see Prob. 9.26). If you agree to stay away from the resonances, the damping can be ignored, and the formula for the index of refraction simpliﬁes: n = 1 + Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j f j ω2 j − ω2 . (9.172) For most substances the natural frequencies ω j are scattered all over the spectrum in a rather chaotic fashion. But for transparent materials, the nearest signiﬁcant resonances typically lie in the ultraviolet, so that ω< ω j . In that case, 1 ω2 j − ω2 = 1 ω2 j ( 1 − ω2 ω2 j )−1 ∼= 1 ω2 j ( 1 + ω2 ω2 j ) , and Eq. 9.172 takes the form n = 1 + ⎛ ⎝ Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j f j ω2 j ⎞ ⎠ + ω2 ⎛ ⎝ Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j f j ω4 j ⎞ ⎠ . (9.173) 424 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves Or, in terms of the wavelength in vacuum (λ = 2π c/ω): n = 1 + A √1 + B λ2 ) . (9.174) This is known as Cauchy’s formula; the constant A is called the coefﬁcient of re- fraction, and B is called the coefﬁcient of dispersion. Cauchy’s equation applies reasonably well to most gases, in the optical region. What I have described in this section is certainly not the complete story of dis- persion in nonconducting media. Nevertheless, it does indicate how the damped harmonic motion of electrons can account for the frequency dependence of the in- dex of refraction, and it explains why n is ordinarily a slowly increasing function of ω, with occasional “anomalous” regions where it precipitously drops. Problem 9.23 (a) Shallow water is nondispersive; waves travel at a speed that is proportional to the square root of the depth. In deep water, however, the waves can’t “feel” all the way down to the bottom—they behave as though the depth were pro- portional to λ. (Actually, the distinction between “shallow” and “deep” itself depends on the wavelength: If the depth is less than λ, the water is “shallow”; if it is substantially greater than λ, the water is “deep.”) Show that the wave velocity of deep water waves is twice the group velocity. (b) In quantum mechanics, a free particle of mass m traveling in the x direction is described by the wave function \u0017(x, t) = Aei( px−Et)/ ¯h, where p is the momentum, and E = p2/2m is the kinetic energy. Calculate the group velocity and the wave velocity. Which one corresponds to the classical speed of the particle? Note that the wave velocity is half the group velocity. Problem 9.24 If you take the model in Ex. 4.1 at face value, what natural frequency do you get? Put in the actual numbers. Where, in the electromagnetic spectrum, does this lie, assuming the radius of the atom is 0.5 Å? Find the coefﬁcients of refraction and dispersion, and compare them with the measured values for hydrogen at 0◦C and atmospheric pressure: A = 1.36 × 10−4, B = 7.7 × 10−15m 2. Problem 9.25 Find the width of the anomalous dispersion region for the case of a single resonance at frequency ω0. Assume γ ≪ ω0. Show that the index of re- fraction assumes its maximum and minimum values at points where the absorption coefﬁcient is at half-maximum. Problem 9.26 Starting with Eq. 9.170, calculate the group velocity, assuming there is only one resonance, at ω0. Use a computer to graph y ≡ vg/c as a function of x ≡ (ω/ω0)2, from x = 0to2,(a) for γ = 0, and (b) for γ = (0.1)ω0.Let (Nq 2)/(2mϵ0ω2 0) = 0.003. Note that the group velocity can exceed c. 9.5 Guided Waves 425 9.5 GUIDED WAVES 9.5.1 Wave Guides So far, we have dealt with plane waves of inﬁnite extent; now we consider elec- tromagnetic waves conﬁned to the interior of a hollow pipe, or wave guide (Fig. 9.23). We’ll assume the wave guide is a perfect conductor, so that E = 0 and B = 0 inside the material itself, and hence the boundary conditions at the inner wall are 21 (i) E ∥ = 0, (ii) B⊥ = 0. } (9.175) Free charges and currents22 will be induced on the surface in such a way as to enforce these constraints. We are interested in monochromatic waves that propa- gate down the tube, so E and B have the generic form (i) ˜E(x, y, z, t) = ˜E0(x, y)ei(kz−ωt), (ii) ˜B(x, y, z, t) = ˜B0(x, y)ei(kz−ωt). } (9.176) (For the cases of interest, k is real, so I shall dispense with its tilde.) The electric and magnetic ﬁelds must, of course, satisfy Maxwell’s equations, in the interior of the wave guide: x z y FIGURE 9.23 21 See Eq. 9.139 and Prob. 7.44. In a perfect conductor, E = 0, and hence (by Faraday’s law) ∂B/∂t = 0; assuming the magnetic ﬁeld started out zero, then, it will remain so. 22 In Section 9.4.2 I argued that there can be no surface currents in an ohmic conductor (with ﬁnite conductivity). But there are volume currents, extending in (roughly) to the skin depth. As the con- ductivity increases, they are squeezed into a thinner and thinner layer, and in the limit of a perfect conductor they become true surface currents. 426 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves (i) ∇ · E = 0,(iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × B = 1 c2 ∂E ∂t . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (9.177) The problem, then, is to ﬁnd functions ˜E0 and ˜B0 such that the ﬁelds (Eq. 9.176) obey the differential equations (Eq. 9.177), subject to boundary conditions (Eq. 9.175). As we shall soon see, conﬁned waves are not (in general) transverse; in order to ﬁt the boundary conditions we shall have to include longitudinal components (Ez and Bz):23 ˜E0 = Ex ˆx + E y ˆy + Ez ˆz, ˜B0 = Bx ˆx + By ˆy + Bz ˆz, (9.178) where each of the components is a function of x and y. Putting this into Maxwell’s equations (iii) and (iv), we obtain (Prob. 9.27a) (i) ∂ E y ∂ x − ∂ Ex ∂ y = iωBz,(iv) ∂ By ∂ x − ∂ Bx ∂ y =− iω c2 Ez, (ii) ∂ Ez ∂ y − ik E y = iωBx ,(v) ∂ Bz ∂ y − ik By =− iω c2 Ex , (iii) ik Ex − ∂ Ez ∂ x = iωBy,(vi) ik Bx − ∂ Bz ∂ x =− iω c2 E y. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.179) Equations (ii), (iii), (v), and (vi) can be solved for Ex , E y, Bx , and By: (i) Ex = i (ω/c)2 − k2 √ k ∂ Ez ∂ x + ω ∂ Bz ∂ y ) , (ii) E y = i (ω/c)2 − k2 √ k ∂ Ez ∂ y − ω ∂ Bz ∂ x ) , (iii) Bx = i (ω/c)2 − k2 √ k ∂ Bz ∂ x − ω c2 ∂ Ez ∂ y ) , (iv) By = i (ω/c)2 − k2 √k ∂ Bz ∂ y + ω c2 ∂ Ez ∂ x ) . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.180) It sufﬁces, then, to determine the longitudinal components Ez and Bz; if we knew those, we could quickly calculate all the others, just by differentiating. Inserting 23 To avoid cumbersome notation, I shall leave the subscript 0 and the tilde off the individual compo- nents. 9.5 Guided Waves 427 Eq. 9.180 into the remaining Maxwell equations (Prob. 9.27b) yields uncoupled equations for Ez and Bz: (i) [ ∂ 2 ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 ∂ y2 + (ω/c)2 − k2] Ez = 0, (ii) [ ∂ 2 ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 ∂ y2 + (ω/c)2 − k2] Bz = 0. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎭ (9.181) If Ez = 0, we call these TE (“transverse electric”) waves;if Bz = 0, they are called TM (“transverse magnetic”) waves; if both Ez = 0 and Bz = 0, we call them TEM waves.24 It turns out that TEM waves cannot occur in a hollow wave guide. Proof. If Ez = 0, Gauss’s law (Eq. 9.177i) says ∂ Ex ∂ x + ∂ E y ∂ y = 0, and if Bz = 0, Faraday’s law (Eq. 9.177iii) says ∂ E y ∂ x − ∂ Ex ∂ y = 0. Indeed, the vector ˜E0 in Eq. 9.178 has zero divergence and zero curl. It can there- fore be written as the gradient of a scalar potential that satisﬁes Laplace’s equa- tion. But the boundary condition on E (Eq. 9.175) requires that the surface be an equipotential, and since Laplace’s equation admits no local maxima or minima (Sect. 3.1.4), this means that the potential is constant throughout, and hence the electric ﬁeld is zero—no wave at all. □ Notice that this argument applies only to a completely empty pipe—if you run a separate conductor down the middle, the potential at its surface need not be the same as on the outer wall, and hence a nontrivial potential is possible. We’ll see an example of this in Sect. 9.5.3. Problem 9.27! (a) Derive Eqs. 9.179, and from these obtain Eqs. 9.180. (b) Put Eq. 9.180 into Maxwell’s equations (i) and (ii) to obtain Eq. 9.181. Check that you get the same results using (i) and (iv) of Eq. 9.179. 24 In the case of TEM waves (including the unconﬁned plane waves of Sect. 9.2), k = ω/c,Eqs.9.180 are indeterminate, and you have to go back to Eqs. 9.179. 428 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves 9.5.2 TE Waves in a Rectangular Wave Guide Suppose we have a wave guide of rectangular shape (Fig. 9.24), with height a and width b, and we are interested in the propagation of TE waves. The problem is to solve Eq. 9.181ii, subject to the boundary condition 9.175ii. We’ll do it by separation of variables. Let Bz(x, y) = X (x)Y (y), so that Y d 2 X dx 2 + X d 2Y dy2 + [ (ω/c)2 − k2] XY = 0. Divide by XY , and note that the x- and y-dependent terms must be constants: (i) 1 X d 2 X dx 2 =−k2 x ,(ii) 1 Y d 2Y dy2 =−k2 y, (9.182) with −k2 x − k2 y + (ω/c)2 − k2 = 0. (9.183) The general solution to Eq. 9.182i is X (x) = A sin (kx x) + B cos (kx x). But the boundary conditions require that Bx —and hence also (Eq. 9.180iii) dX/dx—vanishes at x = 0 and x = a.So A = 0, and kx = mπ/a,(m = 0, 1, 2,... ). (9.184) The same goes for Y , with ky = nπ/b,(n = 0, 1, 2,... ), (9.185) y z x a b FIGURE 9.24 9.5 Guided Waves 429 and we conclude that Bz = B0 cos (mπ x/a) cos (nπ y/b). (9.186) This solution is called the TEmn mode. (The ﬁrst index is conventionally asso- ciated with the larger dimension, so we assume a ≥ b. By the way, at least one of the indices must be nonzero—see Prob. 9.28.) The wave number (k) is obtained by putting Eqs. 9.184 and 9.185 into Eq. 9.183: k = √ (ω/c)2 − π 2[(m/a)2 + (n/b)2]. (9.187) If ω< cπ √(m/a)2 + (n/b)2 ≡ ωmn, (9.188) the wave number is imaginary, and instead of a traveling wave we have expo- nentially attenuated ﬁelds (Eq. 9.176). For this reason, ωmn is called the cutoff frequency for the mode in question. The lowest cutoff frequency for a given wave guide occurs for the mode TE10: ω10 = cπ/a. (9.189) Frequencies less than this will not propagate at all. The wave number can be written more simply in terms of the cutoff frequency: k = 1 c √ ω2 − ω2 mn. (9.190) The wave velocity is v = ω k = c √ 1 − (ωmn/ω)2 , (9.191) which is greater than c. However (see Prob. 9.30), the energy carried by the wave travels at the group velocity (Eq. 9.150): vg = 1 dk/dω = c√1 − (ωmn/ω)2 < c. (9.192) There’s another way to visualize the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a rectangular pipe, and it serves to illuminate many of these results. Con- sider an ordinary plane wave, traveling at an angle θ to the z axis, and reﬂect- ing perfectly off each conducting surface (Fig. 9.25). In the x and y directions, the (multiply reﬂected) waves interfere to form standing wave patterns, of wave- length λx = 2a/m and λy = 2b/n (hence wave number kx = 2π/λx = π m/a and ky = π n/b), respectively. Meanwhile, in the z direction there remains a trav- eling wave, with wave number kz = k. The propagation vector for the “original” plane wave is therefore k ˙ = π m a ˆx + π n b ˆy + k ˆz, 430 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves \u0002 A z θ Wave fronts k′ FIGURE 9.25 and the frequency is ω = c|k ˙|= c√k2 + π 2[(m/a)2 + (n/b)2]= √(ck)2 + (ωmn)2. Only certain angles will lead to one of the allowed standing wave patterns: cos θ = k |k˙| = √ 1 − (ωmn/ω)2. The plane wave travels at speed c, but because it is going at an angle θ to the z axis, its net velocity down the wave guide is vg = c cos θ = c√1 − (ωmn/ω)2. The wave velocity, on the other hand, is the speed of the wave fronts ( A,say,in Fig. 9.25) down the pipe. Like the intersection of a line of breakers with the beach, they can move much faster than the waves themselves—in fact v = c cos θ = c √1 − (ωmn/ω)2 . Problem 9.28 Show that the mode TE00 cannot occur in a rectangular wave guide. [Hint: In this case ω/c = k, so Eqs. 9.180 are indeterminate, and you must go back to Eq. 9.179. Show that Bz is a constant, and hence—applying Faraday’s law in integral form to a cross section—that Bz = 0, so this would be a TEM mode.] Problem 9.29 Consider a rectangular wave guide with dimensions 2.28 cm × 1.01 cm. What TE modes will propagate in this wave guide, if the driving fre- quency is 1.70 × 1010 Hz? Suppose you wanted to excite only one TE mode; what range of frequencies could you use? What are the corresponding wavelengths (in open space)? Problem 9.30 Conﬁrm that the energy in the TEmn mode travels at the group veloc- ity. [Hint: Find the time averaged Poynting vector ⟨S⟩ and the energy density ⟨u⟩ (use Prob. 9.12 if you wish). Integrate over the cross section of the wave guide to get the energy per unit time and per unit length carried by the wave, and take their ratio.] 9.5 Guided Waves 431 Problem 9.31 Work out the theory of TM modes for a rectangular wave guide. In particular, ﬁnd the longitudinal electric ﬁeld, the cutoff frequencies, and the wave and group velocities. Find the ratio of the lowest TM cutoff frequency to the lowest TE cutoff frequency, for a given wave guide. [Caution: What is the lowest TM mode?] 9.5.3 The Coaxial Transmission Line In Sect. 9.5.1, I showed that a hollow wave guide cannot support TEM waves. But a coaxial transmission line, consisting of a long straight wire of radius a, surrounded by a cylindrical conducting sheath of radius b (Fig. 9.26), does admit modes with Ez = 0 and Bz = 0. In this case Maxwell’s equations (Eq. 9.179) yield k = ω/c (9.193) (so the waves travel at speed c, and are nondispersive), cBy = Ex and cBx =−E y (9.194) (so E and B are mutually perpendicular), and (together with ∇ · E = 0, ∇ · B = 0): ∂ Ex ∂ x + ∂ E y ∂ y = 0, ∂ E y ∂ x − ∂ Ex ∂ y = 0, ∂ Bx ∂ x + ∂ By ∂ y = 0, ∂ By ∂ x − ∂ Bx ∂ y = 0. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (9.195) These are precisely the equations of electrostatics and magnetostatics, for empty space, in two dimensions; the solution with cylindrical symmetry can be borrowed directly from the case of an inﬁnite line charge and an inﬁnite straight current, respectively: E0(s,φ) = A s ˆs, B0(s,φ) = A cs ˆφ, (9.196) for some constant A. Substituting these into Eq. 9.176, and taking the real part: E(s,φ, z, t) = A cos (kz − ωt) s ˆs, B(s,φ, z, t) = A cos (kz − ωt) cs ˆφ. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (9.197) z a b FIGURE 9.26 432 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves Problem 9.32 (a) Show directly that Eqs. 9.197 satisfy Maxwell’s equations (Eq. 9.177) and the boundary conditions (Eq. 9.175).

You can see the ﬁsh clearly; how well can it see you? Problem 9.39 According to Snell’s law, when light passes from an optically dense! medium into a less dense one (n1 > n2) the propagation vector k bends away from the normal (Fig. 9.28). In particular, if the light is incident at the critical angle θc ≡ sin −1(n2/n1), (9.200) then θT = 90 ◦, and the transmitted ray just grazes the surface. If θI exceeds θc, there is no refracted ray at all, only a reﬂected one (this is the phenomenon of total internal reﬂection, on which light pipes and ﬁber optics are based). But the ﬁelds 434 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves are not zero in medium 2; what we get is a so-called evanescent wave,which is rapidly attenuated and transports no energy into medium 2. 26 z x kI kT \u0003I \u0003T 1 2 FIGURE 9.28 A quick way to construct the evanescent wave is simply to quote the results of Sect. 9.3.3, with kT = ωn2/c and kT = kT (sin θT ˆx + cos θT ˆz); the only change is that sin θT = n1 n2 sin θI is now greater than 1, and cos θT = √1 − sin 2 θT = i√ sin 2 θT − 1 is imaginary.

(9.202) This is a wave propagating in the x direction (parallel to the interface!), and attenuated in the z direction. 26 The evanescent ﬁelds can be detected by placing a second interface a short distance to the right of the ﬁrst; in a close analog to quantum mechanical tunneling, the wave crosses the gap and reassembles to the right.

CHAPTER 10 Potentials and Fields 10.1 THE POTENTIAL FORMULATION 10.1.1 Scalar and Vector Potentials In this chapter we seek the general solution to Maxwell’s equations, (i) ∇ · E = 1 (0 ρ, (iii) ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0,(iv) ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0(0 ∂E ∂t . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ (10.1) Given ρ(r, t) and J(r, t), what are the ﬁelds E(r, t) and B(r, t)? In the static case, Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law provide the answer. What we’re looking for, then, is the generalization of those laws to time-dependent conﬁgurations. This is not an easy problem, and it pays to begin by representing the ﬁelds in terms of potentials. In electrostatics ∇ × E = 0 allowed us to write E as the gradient of a scalar potential: E =−∇V . In electrodynamics this is no longer possible, because the curl of E is nonzero. But B remains divergenceless, so we can still write B = ∇ × A, (10.2) as in magnetostatics. Putting this into Faraday’s law (iii) yields ∇ × E =− ∂ ∂t (∇ × A), or ∇ × ( E + ∂A ∂t ) = 0. Here is a quantity, unlike E alone, whose curl does vanish; it can therefore be written as the gradient of a scalar: E + ∂A ∂t =−∇V. 436 10.1 The Potential Formulation 437 In terms of V and A, then, E =−∇V − ∂A ∂t . (10.3) This reduces to the old form, of course, when A is constant. The potential representation (Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3) automatically fulﬁlls the two homogeneous Maxwell equations, (ii) and (iii). How about Gauss’s law (i) and the Ampère/Maxwell law (iv)? Putting Eq. 10.3 into (i), we ﬁnd that ∇2V + ∂ ∂t (∇ · A) =− 1 (0 ρ; (10.4) this replaces Poisson’s equation (to which it reduces in the static case). Putting Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3 into (iv) yields ∇ × (∇ × A) = μ0J − μ0(0∇ ( ∂ V ∂t ) − μ0(0 ∂ 2A ∂t 2 , or, using the vector identity ∇ × (∇ × A) = ∇(∇ · A) −∇2A, and rearranging the terms a bit: ( ∇2A − μ0(0 ∂ 2A ∂t 2 ) − ∇ ( ∇ · A + μ0(0 ∂ V ∂t ) =−μ0J. (10.5) Equations 10.4 and 10.5 contain all the information in Maxwell’s equations. Example 10.1. Find the charge and current distributions that would give rise to the potentials V = 0, A = { μ0k 4c (ct −|x|)2 ˆz, for |x| < ct, 0, for |x| > ct, where k is a constant, and (of course) c = 1/ √ (0μ0. 2 μ0kct x Ez − 2 μ0kt − 2 μ0kt x By −ct ct −ct ct FIGURE 10.1 438 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields Solution First we’ll determine the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, using Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3: E =− ∂A ∂t =− μ0k 2 (ct −|x|) ˆz, B = ∇ × A =− μ0k 4c ∂ ∂ x (ct −|x|)2 ˆy =± μ0k 2c (ct −|x|) ˆy, (plus, for x > 0; minus, for x < 0). These are for |x| < ct; when |x| > ct, E = B = 0 (Fig. 10.1). Calculating every derivative in sight, I ﬁnd ∇ · E = 0; ∇ · B = 0; ∇ × E =∓ μ0k 2 ˆy; ∇ × B =− μ0k 2c ˆz; ∂E ∂t =− μ0kc 2 ˆz; ∂B ∂t =± μ0k 2 ˆy. As you can easily check, Maxwell’s equations are all satisﬁed, with ρ and J both zero. Notice, however, that B has a discontinuity at x = 0, and this signals the presence of a surface current K in the yz plane; boundary condition (iv) in Eq. 7.64 gives kt ˆy = K × ˆx, and hence K = kt ˆz. Evidently we have here a uniform surface current ﬂowing in the z direction over the plane x = 0, which starts up at t = 0, and increases in proportion to t.No- tice that the news travels out (in both directions) at the speed of light: for points |x| > ct the message (“current is now ﬂowing”) has not yet arrived, so the ﬁelds are zero. Problem 10.1 Show that the differential equations for V and A (Eqs. 10.4 and 10.5) can be written in the more symmetrical form □ 2V + ∂ L ∂t =− 1 (0 ρ, □ 2A − ∇L =−μ0J, ⎫ ⎪⎬ ⎪⎭ (10.6) where □ 2 ≡∇ 2 − μ0(0 ∂ 2 ∂t 2 and L ≡ ∇ · A + μ0(0 ∂ V ∂t . Problem 10.2 For the conﬁguration in Ex. 10.1, consider a rectangular box of length l, width w, and height h, situated a distance d above the yz plane (Fig. 10.2). 10.1 The Potential Formulation 439 x z hw y d l FIGURE 10.2 (a) Find the energy in the box at time t1 = d/c,and at t2 = (d + h)/c. (b) Find the Poynting vector, and determine the energy per unit time ﬂowing into the box during the interval t1 < t < t2. (c) Integrate the result in (b) from t1 to t2, and conﬁrm that the increase in energy (part (a)) equals the net inﬂux. 10.1.2 Gauge Transformations Equations 10.4 and 10.5 are ugly, and you might be inclined to abandon the potential formulation altogether. However, we have succeeded in reducing six problems—ﬁnding E and B (three components each)—down to four: V (one com- ponent) and A (three more). Moreover, Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3 do not uniquely deﬁne the potentials; we are free to impose extra conditions on V and A, as long as nothing happens to E and B. Let’s work out precisely what this gauge freedom entails. Suppose we have two sets of potentials, (V, A) and (V ′, A ′), which correspond to the same electric and magnetic ﬁelds. By how much can they differ? Write A ′ = A + ααα and V ′ = V + β. Since the two A’s give the same B, their curls must be equal, and hence ∇ × ααα = 0. We can therefore write ααα as the gradient of some scalar: ααα = ∇λ. The two potentials also give the same E,so ∇β + ∂ααα ∂t = 0, 440 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields or ∇ (β + ∂λ ∂t ) = 0. The term in parentheses is therefore independent of position (it could, however, depend on time); call it k(t): β =− ∂λ ∂t + k(t). Actually, we might as well absorb k(t) into λ, deﬁning a new λ by adding∫ t 0 k(t ′)dt ′ to the old one. This will not affect the gradient of λ; it just adds k(t) to ∂λ/∂t. It follows that A ′ = A + ∇λ, V ′ = V − ∂λ ∂t . ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ (10.7) Conclusion: For any old scalar function λ(r, t), we can with impunity add ∇λ to A, provided we simultaneously subtract ∂λ/∂t from V . This will not affect the physical quantities E and B. Such changes in V and A are called gauge trans- formations. They can be exploited to adjust the divergence of A, with a view to simplifying the “ugly” equations 10.4 and 10.5. In magnetostatics, it was best to choose ∇ · A = 0 (Eq. 5.63); in electrodynamics, the situation is not so clear cut, and the most convenient gauge depends to some extent on the problem at hand. There are many famous gauges in the literature; I’ll show you the two most popular ones. Problem 10.3 (a) Find the ﬁelds, and the charge and current distributions, corresponding to V (r, t) = 0, A(r, t) =− 1 4π(0 qt r 2 ˆr. (b) Use the gauge function λ =−(1/4π(0)(qt/r ) to transform the potentials, and comment on the result. Problem 10.4 Suppose V = 0and A = A0 sin(kx − ωt) ˆy,where A0,ω, and k are constants. Find E and B, and check that they satisfy Maxwell’s equations in vacuum. What condition must you impose on ω and k? 10.1.3 Coulomb Gauge and Lorenz Gauge The Coulomb Gauge. As in magnetostatics, we pick ∇ · A = 0. (10.8) With this, Eq. 10.4 becomes ∇2V =− 1 (0 ρ. (10.9) 10.1 The Potential Formulation 441 This is Poisson’s equation, and we already know how to solve it: setting V = 0at inﬁnity, V (r, t) = 1 4π(0 ∫ ρ(r ′, t) r dτ ′. (10.10) There is a very peculiar thing about the scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge: it is determined by the distribution of charge right now. If I move an electron in my laboratory, the potential V on the moon immediately records this change. That sounds particularly odd in the light of special relativity, which allows no message to travel faster than c. The point is that V by itself is not a physically measurable quantity—all the man in the moon can measure is E, and that involves A as well (Eq. 10.3). Somehow it is built into the vector potential (in the Coulomb gauge) that whereas V instantaneously reﬂects all changes in ρ, the combination −∇V − (∂A/∂t) does not; E will change only after sufﬁcient time has elapsed for the “news” to arrive.1 The advantage of the Coulomb gauge is that the scalar potential is particu- larly simple to calculate; the disadvantage (apart from the acausal appearance of V ) is that A is particularly difﬁcult to calculate. The differential equation for A (Eq. 10.5) in the Coulomb gauge reads ∇2A − μ0(0 ∂ 2A ∂t 2 =−μ0J + μ0(0∇ ( ∂ V ∂t ) . (10.11) The Lorenz gauge. In the Lorenz2 gauge, we pick ∇ · A =−μ0(0 ∂ V ∂t . (10.12) This is designed to eliminate the middle term in Eq. 10.5 (in the language of Prob. 10.1, it sets L = 0). With this, ∇2A − μ0(0 ∂ 2A ∂t 2 =−μ0J. (10.13) Meanwhile, the differential equation for V, (Eq. 10.4), becomes ∇2V − μ0(0 ∂ 2V ∂t 2 =− 1 (0 ρ. (10.14) The virtue of the Lorenz gauge is that it treats V and A on an equal footing: the same differential operator ∇2 − μ0(0 ∂ 2 ∂t 2 ≡ □ 2, (10.15) 1See O. L. Brill and B. Goodman. Am.J.Phys. 35, 832 (1967) and J. D. Jackson, Am.J.Phys. 70, 917 (2001). 2Until recently, it was spelled “Lorentz,” in honor of the Dutch physicist H. A. Lorentz, but it is now attributed to L. V. Lorenz, the Dane. See J. Van Bladel, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine 33(2), 69 (1991); J. D. Jackson and L. B. Okun, Rev. Mod. Phys. 73, 663 (2001). 442 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields (called the d’Alembertian) occurs in both equations: (i) □ 2V =− 1 (0 ρ, (ii) □ 2A =−μ0J. (10.16) This democratic treatment of V and A is especially nice in the context of special relativity, where the d’Alembertian is the natural generalization of the Laplacian, and Eqs. 10.16 can be regarded as four-dimensional versions of Poisson’s equa- tion. In this same spirit, the wave equation □ 2 f = 0, might be regarded as the four-dimensional version of Laplace’s equation. In the Lorenz gauge, V and A satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation, with a “source” term (in place of zero) on the right. From now on, I shall use the Lorenz gauge exclusively, and the whole of electrodynamics reduces to the problem of solving the inhomogeneous wave equation for a speciﬁed source. Problem 10.5 Which of the potentials in Ex. 10.1, Prob. 10.3, and Prob. 10.4 are in the Coulomb gauge? Which are in the Lorenz gauge? (Notice that these gauges are not mutually exclusive.) Problem 10.6 In Chapter 5, I showed that it is always possible to pick a vector potential whose divergence is zero (the Coulomb gauge). Show that it is always possible to choose ∇ · A =−μ0(0(∂ V /∂t), as required for the Lorenz gauge, as- suming you know how to solve the inhomogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16). Is it always possible to pick V = 0? How about A = 0? Problem 10.7 A time-dependent point charge q(t) at the origin, ρ(r, t) = q(t)δ3(r), is fed by a current J(r, t) =−(1/4π)( ˙q/r 2) ˆr,where ˙q ≡ dq/dt. (a) Check that charge is conserved, by conﬁrming that the continuity equation is obeyed. (b) Find the scalar and vector potentials in the Coulomb gauge. If you get stuck, try working on (c) ﬁrst. (c) Find the ﬁelds, and check that they satisfy all of Maxwell’s equations.3 10.1.4 Lorentz Force Law in Potential Form4 It is illuminating to express the Lorentz force law in terms of potentials: F = dp dt = q(E + v × B) = q [ −∇V − ∂A ∂t + v × (∇ × A) ] , (10.17) 3P. R. Berman, Am.J.Phys. 76 48 (2008). 4This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. 10.1 The Potential Formulation 443 where p = mv is the momentum of the particle. Now, product rule 4 says ∇(v · A) = v × (∇ × A) + (v · ∇)A (v, the velocity of the particle, is a function of time, but not of position). Thus dp dt =−q [ ∂A ∂t + (v · ∇)A + ∇(V − v · A) ] . (10.18) The combination [ ∂A ∂t + (v · ∇)A ] is called the convective derivative of A, and written dA/dt (total derivative). It represents the time rate of change of A at the (moving) location of the particle. For suppose that at time t the particle is at point r, where the potential is A(r, t); a moment dt later it is at r + v dt, where the potential is A(r + v dt, t + dt).The change in A, then, is dA = A(r + v dt, t + dt) − A(r, t) = ( ∂A ∂ x ) (vx dt) + ( ∂A ∂ y ) (vy dt) + ( ∂A ∂z ) (vz dt) + ( ∂A ∂t ) dt, so dA dt = ∂A ∂t + (v · ∇)A. (10.19) As the particle moves, the potential it “feels” changes for two distinct reasons: ﬁrst, because the potential varies with time, and second, because it is now in a new location, where A is different because of its variation in space. Hence the two terms in Eq. 10.19. With the aid of the convective derivative, the Lorentz force law reads: d dt (p + qA) =−∇ [ q(V − v · A) ] . (10.20) This is reminiscent of the standard formula from mechanics, for the motion of a particle whose potential energy U is a speciﬁed function of position: dp dt =−∇U. Playing the role of p is the so-called canonical momentum, pcan = p + qA, (10.21) while the part of U is taken by the velocity-dependent quantity Uvel = q(V − v · A). (10.22) 444 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields A similar argument (Prob. 10.9) gives the rate of change of the particle’s energy: d dt (T + qV ) = ∂ ∂t [q(V − v · A)], (10.23) where T = 1 2 mv2 is its kinetic energy and qV is its potential energy (The deriva- tive on the right acts only on V and A, not on v). Curiously, the same quantity 5 Uvel appears on the right side of both equations. The parallel between Eq. 10.20 and Eq. 10.23 invites us to interpret A as a kind of “potential momentum” per unit charge, just as V is potential energy per unit charge.6 Problem 10.8 The vector potential for a uniform magnetostatic ﬁeld is A =− 1 2 (r×B) (Prob. 5.25). Show that dA/dt =− 1 2 (v × B), in this case, and conﬁrm that Eq. 10.20 yields the correct equation of motion. Problem 10.9 Derive Eq. 10.23. [Hint: Start by dotting v into Eq. 10.17.] 10.2 CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS 10.2.1 Retarded Potentials In the static case, Eq. 10.16 reduces to (four copies of) Poisson’s equation, ∇2V =− 1 (0 ρ, ∇2A =−μ0J, with the familiar solutions V (r) = 1 4π(0 ∫ ρ(r ′) r dτ ′, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′) r dτ ′, (10.24) dτ\u0002 r r r\u0002 O FIGURE 10.3 5I don’t know what to call Uvel—it’s not potential energy, exactly (that would be qV ). 6There are other arguments for this interpretation, which Maxwell himself favored, and many modern authors advocate. For a fascinating discussion, see M. D. Semon and J. R. Taylor, Am. J. Phys. 64, 1361 (1996). Incidentally, it is the canonical angular momentum (derived from pcan), not the mechanical portion alone, that is quantized—see R. H. Young, Am.J.Phys. 66, 1043 (1998). 10.2 Continuous Distributions 445 where r, as always, is the distance from the source point r ′ to the ﬁeld point r (Fig. 10.3). Now, electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light. In the non- static case, therefore, it’s not the status of the source right now that matters, but rather its condition at some earlier time tr (called the retarded time) when the “message” left. Since this message must travel a distance r, the delay is r/c: tr ≡ t − r c . (10.25) The natural generalization of Eq. 10.24 for nonstatic sources is therefore V (r, t) = 1 4π(0 ∫ ρ(r ′, tr ) r dτ ′, A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′, tr ) r dτ ′. (10.26) Here ρ(r ′, tr ) is the charge density that prevailed at point r ′ at the retarded time tr . Because the integrands are evaluated at the retarded time, these are called re- tarded potentials. (I speak of “the” retarded time, but of course the more distant parts of the charge distribution have earlier retarded times than nearby ones. It’s just like the night sky: The light we see now left each star at the retarded time cor- responding to that star’s distance from the earth.) Note that the retarded potentials reduce properly to Eq. 10.24 in the static case, for which ρ and J are independent of time. Well, that all sounds reasonable—and surprisingly simple. But are we sure it’s right? I didn’t actually derive the formulas for V and A (Eq. 10.26); all I did was invoke a heuristic argument (“electromagnetic news travels at the speed of light”) to make them seem plausible.To prove them, I must show that they satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16) and meet the Lorenz condition (Eq. 10.12). In case you think I’m being fussy, let me warn you that if you apply the same logic to the ﬁelds you’ll get entirely the wrong answer: E(r, t) ̸= 1 4π(0 ∫ ρ(r ′, tr ) r2 ˆr dτ ′, B(r, t) ̸= μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′, tr ) × ˆr r2 dτ ′. Let’s stop and check, then, that the retarded scalar potential satisﬁes Eq. 10.16; essentially the same argument would serve for the vector potential. 7 I shall leave it for you (Prob. 10.10) to show that the retarded potentials obey the Lorenz condition. In calculating the Laplacian of V (r, t), the crucial point to notice is that the integrand (in Eq. 10.26) depends on r in two places: explicitly, in the denominator (r =|r − r ′|), and implicitly, through tr = t − r/c, in the numerator. Thus ∇V = 1 4π(0 ∫ [ (∇ρ) 1 r + ρ∇ ( 1 r )] dτ ′, (10.27) 7I’ll give you the straightforward but cumbersome proof; for a clever indirect argument see M. A. Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3d ed., Sect. 8.1 (Orlando, FL: Saunders (1995)). 446 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields and ∇ρ =˙ρ ∇tr =− 1 c ˙ρ ∇r (10.28) (The dot denotes differentiation with respect to time). 8 Now ∇r = ˆr and ∇(1/r) = −ˆr/r 2 (Prob. 1.13), so ∇V = 1 4π(0 ∫ [ − ˙ρ c ˆr r − ρ ˆr r2 ] dτ ′. (10.29) Taking the divergence, ∇2V = 1 4π(0 ∫ { − 1 c [ ˆr r · (∇ ˙ρ) +˙ρ ∇ · ( ˆr r )] − [ ˆr r2 · (∇ρ) + ρ∇ · ( ˆr r2 )]} dτ ′. But ∇ ˙ρ =− 1 c ¨ρ ∇r =− 1 c ¨ρ ˆr, as in Eq. 10.28, and ∇ · ( ˆr r ) = 1 r2 (Prob. 1.63), whereas ∇ · ( ˆr r2 ) = 4πδ3(r) (Eq. 1.100). So ∇2V = 1 4π(0 ∫ [ 1 c2 ¨ρ r − 4πρδ3(r)] dτ ′ = 1 c2 ∂ 2V ∂t 2 − 1 (0 ρ(r, t), conﬁrming that the retarded potential (Eq. 10.26) satisﬁes the inhomogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16). □ Incidentally, this proof applies equally well to the advanced potentials, Va(r, t) = 1 4π(0 ∫ ρ(r ′, ta) r dτ ′, Aa(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′, ta) r dτ ′, (10.30) in which the charge and the current densities are evaluated at the advanced time ta ≡ t + r c . (10.31) A few signs are changed, but the ﬁnal result is unaffected. Although the advanced potentials are entirely consistent with Maxwell’s equations, they violate the most sacred tenet in all of physics: the principle of causality. They suggest that the po- tentials now depend on what the charge and the current distribution will be at some 8Note that ∂/∂tr = ∂/∂t, since tr = t − r/c and r is independent of t. 10.2 Continuous Distributions 447 time in the future—the effect, in other words, precedes the cause. Although the advanced potentials are of some theoretical interest, they have no direct physical signiﬁcance. 9 Example 10.2. An inﬁnite straight wire carries the current I (t) = { 0, for t ≤ 0, I0, for t > 0. That is, a constant current I0 is turned on abruptly at t = 0. Find the resulting electric and magnetic ﬁelds. s z I r dz P FIGURE 10.4 Solution The wire is presumably electrically neutral, so the scalar potential is zero. Let the wire lie along the z axis (Fig. 10.4); the retarded vector potential at point P is A(s, t) = μ0 4π ˆz ∫ ∞ −∞ I (tr ) r dz. For t < s/c, the “news” has not yet reached P, and the potential is zero. For t > s/c, only the segment |z|≤ √ (ct)2 − s2 (10.32) contributes (outside this range tr is negative, so I (tr ) = 0); thus A(s, t) = ( μ0 I0 4π ˆz ) 2 ∫ √(ct)2−s2 0 dz √ s2 + z2 = μ0 I0 2π ˆz ln (√s2 + z2 + z)∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ √(ct)2−s2 0 = μ0 I0 2π ln ( ct + √(ct)2 − s2 s ) ˆz. 9Because the d’Alembertian involves t 2 (as opposed to t), the theory itself is time-reversal invariant, and does not distinguish “past” from “future.” Time asymmetry is introduced when we select the retarded potentials in preference to the advanced ones, reﬂecting the (not unreasonable!) belief that electromagnetic inﬂuences propagate forward, not backward, in time. 448 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields The electric ﬁeld is E(s, t) =− ∂A ∂t =− μ0 I0c 2π √(ct)2 − s2 ˆz, and the magnetic ﬁeld is B(s, t) = ∇ × A =− ∂ Az ∂s ˆφ = μ0 I0 2π s ct √(ct)2 − s2 ˆφ. Notice that as t →∞ we recover the static case: E = 0, B = (μ0 I0/2π s) ˆφ. Problem 10.10 Conﬁrm that the retarded potentials satisfy the Lorenz gauge con-! dition. [Hint: First show that ∇ · ( J r ) = 1 r (∇ · J) + 1 r (∇′ · J) − ∇′ · ( J r ) , where ∇ denotes derivatives with respect to r,and ∇′ denotes derivatives with re- spect to r ′. Next, noting that J(r ′, t − r/c) depends on r ′ both explicitly and through r, whereas it depends on r only through r, conﬁrm that ∇ · J =− 1 c ˙J · (∇r), ∇′ · J =− ˙ρ − 1 c ˙J · (∇′r). Use this to calculate the divergence of A (Eq. 10.26).] Problem 10.11! (a) Suppose the wire in Ex. 10.2 carries a linearly increasing current I (t) = kt, for t > 0. Find the electric and magnetic ﬁelds generated. (b) Do the same for the case of a sudden burst of current: I (t) = q0δ(t). a b x y I FIGURE 10.5 Problem 10.12 A piece of wire bent into a loop, as shown in Fig. 10.5, carries a current that increases linearly with time: I (t) = kt (−∞ < t < ∞). Calculate the retarded vector potential A at the center. Find the electric ﬁeld at the center. Why does this (neutral) wire produce an electric ﬁeld? (Why can’t you determine the magnetic ﬁeld from this expression for A?) 10.2 Continuous Distributions 449 10.2.2 Jeﬁmenko’s Equations Given the retarded potentials V (r, t) = 1 4π(0 ∫ ρ(r ′, tr ) r dτ ′, A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′, tr ) r dτ ′, (10.33) it is, in principle, a straightforward matter to determine the ﬁelds: E =−∇V − ∂A ∂t , B = ∇ × A. (10.34) But the details are not entirely trivial because, as I mentioned earlier, the in- tegrands depend on r both explicitly, through r =|r − r ′| in the denominator, and implicitly, through the retarded time tr = t − r/c in the argument of the numerator. I already calculated the gradient of V (Eq. 10.29); the time derivative of A is easy: ∂A ∂t = μ0 4π ∫ ˙J r dτ ′. (10.35) Putting them together (and using c2 = 1/μ0(0): E(r, t) = 1 4π(0 ∫ [ ρ(r ′, tr ) r2 ˆr + ˙ρ(r ′, tr ) cr ˆr − ˙J(r ′, tr ) c2r ] dτ ′. (10.36) This is the time-dependent generalization of Coulomb’s law, to which it reduces in the static case (where the second and third terms drop out and the ﬁrst term loses its dependence on tr ). As for B, the curl of A contains two terms: ∇ × A = μ0 4π ∫ [ 1 r (∇ × J) − J × ∇ ( 1 r )] dτ ′. Now (∇ × J)x = ∂ Jz ∂ y − ∂ Jy ∂z , and ∂ Jz ∂ y = ˙Jz ∂tr ∂ y =− 1 c ˙Jz ∂r ∂ y , so (∇ × J)x =− 1 c ( ˙Jz ∂r ∂ y − ˙Jy ∂r ∂z ) = 1 c [˙J × (∇r)] x . 450 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields But ∇r = ˆr (Prob. 1.13), so ∇ × J = 1 c ˙J × ˆr. (10.37) Meanwhile ∇(1/r) =−ˆr/r 2 (again, Prob. 1.13), and hence B(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ [ J(r ′, tr ) r2 + ˙J(r ′, tr ) cr ] × ˆr dτ ′. (10.38) This is the time-dependent generalization of the Biot-Savart law, to which it re- duces in the static case. Equations 10.36 and 10.38 are the (causal) solutions to Maxwell’s equations. For some reason, they do not seem to have been published until quite recently— the earliest explicit statement of which I am aware was by Oleg Jeﬁmenko, in 1966.10 In practice Jeﬁmenko’s equations are of limited utility, since it is typi- cally easier to calculate the retarded potentials and differentiate them, rather than going directly to the ﬁelds. Nevertheless, they provide a satisfying sense of clo- sure to the theory. They also help to clarify an observation I made in the previous section: To get to the retarded potentials, all you do is replace t by tr in the elec- trostatic and magnetostatic formulas, but in the case of the ﬁelds not only is time replaced by retarded time, but completely new terms (involving derivatives of ρ and J) appear. And they provide surprisingly strong support for the quasistatic approximation (see Prob. 10.14). Problem 10.13 Suppose J(r) is constant in time, so (Prob. 7.60) ρ(r, t) = ρ(r, 0) + ˙ρ(r, 0)t. Show that E(r, t) = 1 4π(0 ∫ ρ(r ′, t) r2 ˆr dτ ′; that is, Coulomb’s law holds, with the charge density evaluated at the non-retarded time. Problem 10.14 Suppose the current density changes slowly enough that we can (to good approximation) ignore all higher derivatives in the Taylor expansion J(tr ) = J(t) + (tr − t)˙J(t) + ··· (for clarity, I suppress the r-dependence, which is not at issue). Show that a fortu- itous cancellation in Eq. 10.38 yields B(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′, t) × ˆr r2 dτ ′. 10O. D. Jeﬁmenko, Electricity and Magnetism (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1966), Sect. 15.7.

This means that the quasistatic approximation is actually much better than we had any right to expect: the two errors involved (neglecting retardation and dropping the second term in Eq. 10.38) cancel one another, to ﬁrst order. 10.3 POINT CHARGES 10.3.1 Liénard-Wiechert Potentials My next project is to calculate the (retarded) potentials, V (r, t) and A(r, t),ofa point charge q that is moving on a speciﬁed trajectory w(t) ≡ position of q at time t. (10.39) A naïve reading of the formula (Eq. 10.26) V (r, t) = 1 4π(0 ∫ ρ(r ′, tr ) r dτ ′ (10.40) might suggest to you that the potential is simply 1 4π(0 q r (the same as in the static case, with the understanding that r is the distance to the retarded position of the charge). But this is wrong, for a very subtle reason: It is true that for a point source the denominator r comes outside the integral, 11 but what remains, ∫ ρ(r ′, tr ) dτ ′, (10.41) is not equal to the charge of the particle (and depends, through tr , on the location of the point r). To calculate the total charge of a conﬁguration, you must inte- grate ρ over the entire distribution at one instant of time, but here the retardation, tr = t − r/c, obliges us to evaluate ρ at different times for different parts of the conﬁguration. If the source is moving, this will give a distorted picture of the total charge. You might think that this problem would disappear for point charges, but it doesn’t. In Maxwell’s electrodynamics, formulated as it is in terms of charge and current densities, a point charge must be regarded as the limit of an extended charge, when the size goes to zero. And for an extended particle, no matter how small, the retardation in Eq. 10.41 throws in a factor (1 − ˆr · v/c) −1, where v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time: ∫ ρ(r ′, tr ) dτ ′ = q 1 − ˆr · v/c . (10.42) 11There is, however, an implicit change in its functional dependence: Before the integration, r =|r − r′| is a function of r and r′; after the integration, which ﬁxes r′ = w(tr ), r =|r − w(tr )| is (like tr ) a function of r and t. 452 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields Proof. This is a purely geometrical effect, and it may help to tell the story in a less abstract context. You will not have noticed it, for obvious reasons, but the fact is that a train coming towards you looks a little longer than it really is, because the light you receive from the caboose left earlier than the light you receive si- multaneously from the engine, and at that earlier time the train was farther away (Fig. 10.6). In the interval it takes light from the caboose to travel the extra dis- tance L ′, the train itself moves a distance L ′ − L: L ′ c = L ′ − L v , or L ′ = L 1 − v/c . L L\u0002 v FIGURE 10.6 So approaching trains appear longer, by a factor (1 − v/c)−1. By contrast, a train going away from you looks shorter,12 by a factor (1 + v/c)−1. In general, if the train’s velocity makes an angle θ with your line of sight,13 the extra distance light from the caboose must cover is L ′ cos θ (Fig. 10.7). In the time L ′ cos θ/c, then, the train moves a distance (L ′ − L): L ′ cos θ c = L ′ − L v , or L ′ = L 1 − v cos θ/c . θ r To observer L L\u0002 \u0003 FIGURE 10.7 Notice that this effect does not distort the dimensions perpendicular to the motion (the height and width of the train). Never mind that the light from the far 12Please note that this has nothing whatever to do with special relativity or Lorentz contraction—L is the length of the moving train, and its rest length is not at issue. The argument is somewhat reminiscent of the Doppler effect. 13I assume the train is far enough away or (more to the point) short enough so that rays from the caboose and engine can be considered parallel. 10.3 Point Charges 453 side is delayed in reaching you (relative to light from the near side)—since there’s no motion in that direction, they’ll still look the same distance apart. The apparent volume τ ′ of the train, then, is related to the actual volume τ by τ ′ = τ 1 − ˆr · v/c , (10.43) where ˆr is a unit vector from the train to the observer. In case the connection between moving trains and retarded potentials eludes you, the point is this: Whenever you do an integral of the type in Eq. 10.41, in which the integrand is evaluated at the retarded time, the effective volume is mod- iﬁed by the factor in Eq. 10.43, just as the apparent volume of the train was. Because this correction factor makes no reference to the size of the particle, it is every bit as signiﬁcant for a point charge as for an extended charge. □ Meanwhile, for a point charge the retarded time is determined implicitly by the equation |r − w(tr )|= c(t − tr ). (10.44) The left side is the distance the “news” must travel, and (t − tr ) is the time it takes to make the trip (Fig. 10.8); r is the vector from the retarded position to the ﬁeld point r: r = r − w(tr ). (10.45) It is important to note that at most one point on the trajectory is “in commu- nication” with r at any particular time t. For suppose there were two such points, with retarded times t1 and t2: r1 = c(t − t1) and r2 = c(t − t2). y z x r r w(tr) q Particle trajectory Retarded position Present position FIGURE 10.8 454 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields Then r1 − r2 = c(t2 − t1), so the average speed of the particle in the direction of the point r would have to be c—and that’s not counting whatever velocity the charge might have in other directions. Since no charged particle can travel at the speed of light, it follows that only one retarded point contributes to the potentials, at any given moment.14 It follows, then, that V (r, t) = 1 4π(0 qc (rc − r · v) , (10.46) where v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, and r is the vector from the retarded position to the ﬁeld point r. Moreover, since the current density is ρv (Eq. 5.26), the vector potential is A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ ρ(r ′, tr )v(tr ) r dτ ′ = μ0 4π v r ∫ ρ(r ′, tr ) dτ ′, or A(r, t) = μ0 4π qcv (rc − r · v) = v c2 V (r, t). (10.47) Equations 10.46 and 10.47 are the famous Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. 15 Example 10.3. Find the potentials of a point charge moving with constant velocity. Solution For convenience, let’s say the particle passes through the origin at time t = 0, so that w(t) = vt. We ﬁrst compute the retarded time, using Eq. 10.44: |r − vtr |= c(t − tr ), 14For the same reason, an observer at r sees the particle in only one place at a time. By contrast, it is possible to hear an object in two places at once. Consider a bear who growls at you and then runs toward you at the speed of sound and growls again; you hear both growls at the same time, coming from two different locations, but there’s only one bear. 15There are many ways to obtain the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I have tried to emphasize the ge- ometrical origin of the factor (1 − ˆr · v/c)−1; for illuminating commentary, see W. K. H. Panofsky and M. Phillips, Classical Electricity and Magnetism, 2d ed. (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1962), pp. 342-3. A more rigorous derivation is provided by J. R. Reitz, F. J. Milford, and R. W. Christy, Foundations of Electromagnetic Theory, 3d ed. (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1979), Sect. 21.1, or M. A. Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3d ed. (Orlando, FL: Saunders, 1995), Sect. 8.3. 10.3 Point Charges 455 or, squaring: r 2 − 2r · vtr + v2t 2 r = c2(t 2 − 2ttr + t 2 r ). Solving for tr by the quadratic formula, I ﬁnd that tr = (c2t − r · v) ± √(c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r 2 − c2t 2) c2 − v2 . (10.48) To ﬁx the sign, consider the limit v = 0: tr = t ± r c . In this case the charge is at rest at the origin, and the retarded time should be (t − r/c); evidently we want the minus sign. Now, from Eqs. 10.44 and 10.45, r = c(t − tr ), and ˆr = r − vtr c(t − tr ) , so r(1 − ˆr · v/c) = c(t − tr ) [1 − v c · (r − vtr ) c(t − tr ) ] = c(t − tr ) − v · r c + v2 c tr = 1 c [(c2t − r · v) − (c2 − v2)tr ] = 1 c √(c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r 2 − c2t 2) (I used Eq. 10.48, with the minus sign, in the last step). Therefore, V (r, t) = 1 4π(0 qc √(c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r 2 − c2t 2) , (10.49) and (Eq. 10.47) A(r, t) = μ0 4π qcv √ (c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r 2 − c2t 2) . (10.50) Problem 10.15 A particle of charge q moves in a circle of radius a at constant angular velocity ω. (Assume that the circle lies in the xy plane, centered at the origin, and at time t = 0 the charge is at (a, 0), on the positive x axis.) Find the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for points on the z axis. Problem 10.16 Show that the scalar potential of a point charge moving with con-• stant velocity (Eq. 10.49) can be written more simply as V (r, t) = 1 4π(0 q R√1 − v2 sin 2 θ/c2 , (10.51) 456 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields where R ≡ r − vt is the vector from the present (!) position of the particle to the ﬁeld point r,and θ is the angle between R and v (Fig. 10.9). Note that for nonrela- tivistic velocities (v2 ≪ c2), V (r, t) ≈ 1 4π(0 q R . θ q R v FIGURE 10.9 Problem 10.17 I showed that at most one point on the particle trajectory commu- nicates with r at any given time. In some cases there may be no such point (an observer at r would not see the particle—in the colorful language of general rela- tivity, it is “over the horizon”). As an example, consider a particle in hyperbolic motion along the x axis: w(t) = √b2 + (ct)2 ˆx (−∞ < t < ∞). (10.52) (In special relativity, this is the trajectory of a particle subject to a constant force F = mc2/b.) Sketch the graph of w versus t. At four or ﬁve representative points on the curve, draw the trajectory of a light signal emitted by the particle at that point—both in the plus x direction and in the minus x direction. What region on your graph corresponds to points and times (x, t) from which the particle cannot be seen? At what time does someone at point x ﬁrst see the particle? (Prior to this the potential at x is zero.) Is it possible for a particle, once seen, to disappear from view? Problem 10.18 Determine the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a charge in hyper-! bolic motion (Eq. 10.52). Assume the point r is on the x axis and to the right of the charge. 16 10.3.2 The Fields of a Moving Point Charge We are now in a position to calculate the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a point charge in arbitrary motion, using the Liénard-Wiechert potentials: 17 V (r, t) = 1 4π(0 qc (rc − r · v) , A(r, t) = v c2 V (r, t), (10.53) 16The ﬁelds of a point charge in hyperbolic motion are notoriously tricky. Indeed, a straightforward application of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials yields an electric ﬁeld in violation of Gauss’s law. This paradox was resolved by Bondi and Gold in 1955. For a history of the problem, see E. Eriksen and Ø. Grøn, Ann. Phys. 286, 320 (2000). 17You can get the ﬁelds directly from Jeﬁmenko’s equations, but it’s not easy. See, for example, M. A. Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3d ed. (Orlando, FL: Saunders, 1995), Sect. 8.4. 10.3 Point Charges 457 and the equations for E and B: E =−∇V − ∂A ∂t , B = ∇ × A. The differentiation is tricky, however, because r = r − w(tr ) and v = ˙w(tr ) (10.54) are both evaluated at the retarded time, and tr —deﬁned implicitly by the equation |r − w(tr )|= c(t − tr ) (10.55) —is itself afunctionof r and t. 18 So hang on: the next two pages are rough going ...but the answer is worth the effort. Let’s begin with the gradient of V : ∇V = qc 4π(0 −1 (rc − r · v)2 ∇(rc − r · v). (10.56) Since r = c(t − tr ),19 ∇r =−c∇tr . (10.57) As for the second term, product rule 4 gives ∇(r · v) = (r · ∇)v + (v · ∇)r + r × (∇ × v) + v × (∇ × r). (10.58) Evaluating these terms one at a time: (r · ∇)v = (rx ∂ ∂ x + ry ∂ ∂ y + rz ∂ ∂z ) v(tr ) = rx dv dtr ∂tr ∂ x + ry dv dtr ∂tr ∂ y + rz dv dtr ∂tr ∂z = a(r · ∇tr ), (10.59) where a ≡ ˙v is the acceleration of the particle at the retarded time. Now (v · ∇)r = (v · ∇)r − (v · ∇)w, (10.60) 18The following calculation is done by the most direct, “brute force” method. For a more clever and efﬁcient approach, see J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3d ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1999), Sect. 14.1. 19Remember that r = r − w(tr ) (Fig. 10.8), and tr is itself a function of r. Contrast Prob. 1.13 (and Section 10.2), where r = r − r′ (Fig. 10.3), and r′ was an independent variable. In that case ∇r = ˆr, but here we have a more complicated problem on our hands. 458 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields and (v · ∇)r = ( vx ∂ ∂ x + vy ∂ ∂ y + vz ∂ ∂z ) (x ˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz) = vx ˆx + vy ˆy + vz ˆz = v, (10.61) while (v · ∇)w = v(v · ∇tr ) (same reasoning as Eq. 10.59). Moving on to the third term in Eq. 10.58, ∇ × v = ( ∂vz ∂ y − ∂vy ∂z ) ˆx + ( ∂vx ∂z − ∂vz ∂ x ) ˆy + ( ∂vy ∂ x − ∂vx ∂ y ) ˆz = ( dvz dtr ∂tr ∂ y − dvy dtr ∂tr ∂z ) ˆx + ( dvx dtr ∂tr ∂z − dvz dtr ∂tr ∂ x ) ˆy + ( dvy dtr ∂tr ∂ x − dvx dtr ∂tr ∂ y ) ˆz =−a × ∇tr . (10.62) Finally, ∇ × r = ∇ × r − ∇ × w, (10.63) but ∇ × r = 0, while, by the same argument as Eq. 10.62, ∇ × w =−v × ∇tr . (10.64) Putting all this back into Eq. 10.58, and using the “BAC-CAB” rule to reduce the triple cross products, ∇(r · v) = a(r · ∇tr ) + v − v(v · ∇tr ) − r × (a × ∇tr ) + v × (v × ∇tr ) = v + (r · a − v2)∇tr . (10.65) Collecting Eqs. 10.57 and 10.65, we have ∇V = qc 4π(0 1 (rc − r · v)2 [ v + (c2 − v2 + r · a)∇tr ] . (10.66) To complete the calculation, we need to know ∇tr . This can be found by taking the gradient of the deﬁning equation (Eq. 10.55)—which we have already done in Eq. 10.57—and expanding ∇r: −c∇tr = ∇r = ∇√ r · r = 1 2 √r · r ∇(r · r) = 1 r [(r · ∇)r + r × (∇ × r)] . (10.67) 10.3 Point Charges 459 But (r · ∇)r = r − v(r · ∇tr ) (same idea as Eq. 10.60), while (from Eqs. 10.63 and 10.64) ∇ × r = (v × ∇tr ). Thus −c∇tr = 1 r [r − v(r · ∇tr ) + r × (v × ∇tr )] = 1 r [r − (r · v)∇tr ] , and hence ∇tr = −r rc − r · v . (10.68) Incorporating this result into Eq. 10.66, I conclude that ∇V = 1 4π(0 qc (rc − r · v)3 [ (rc − r · v)v − (c2 − v2 + r · a)r] . (10.69) A similar calculation, which I shall leave for you (Prob. 10.19), yields ∂A ∂t = 1 4π(0 qc (rc − r · v)3 [ (rc − r · v)(−v + ra/c) + r c (c2 − v2 + r · a)v ] . (10.70) Combining these results, and introducing the vector u ≡ c ˆr − v, (10.71) I ﬁnd E(r, t) = q 4π(0 r (r · u)3 [ (c2 − v2)u + r × (u × a) ] . (10.72) Meanwhile, ∇ × A = 1 c2 ∇ × (V v) = 1 c2 [V (∇ × v) − v × (∇V )] . We have already calculated ∇ × v (Eq. 10.62) and ∇V (Eq. 10.69). Putting these together, ∇ × A =− 1 c q 4π(0 1 (u · r)3 r × [ (c2 − v2)v + (r · a)v + (r · u)a ] . The quantity in brackets is strikingly similar to the one in Eq. 10.72, which can be written, using the BAC-CAB rule, as [(c2 − v2)u + (r · a)u − (r · u)a];the main 460 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields difference is that we have v’s instead of u’s in the ﬁrst two terms. In fact, since it’s all crossed into r anyway, we can with impunity change these v’s into −u’s; the extra term proportional to r disappears in the cross product. It follows that B(r, t) = 1 c ˆr × E(r, t). (10.73) Evidently the magnetic ﬁeld of a point charge is always perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld, and to the vector from the retarded point. The ﬁrst term in E (the one involving (c2 − v2)u) falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the particle. If the velocity and acceleration are both zero, this term alone survives and reduces to the old electrostatic result E = 1 4π(0 q r2 ˆr. For this reason, the ﬁrst term in E is sometimes called the generalized Coulomb ﬁeld. (Because it does not depend on the acceleration, it is also known as the velocity ﬁeld.) The second term (the one involving r × (u × a)) falls off as the inverse ﬁrst power of r and is therefore dominant at large distances. As we shall see in Chapter 11, it is this term that is responsible for electromagnetic radiation; accordingly, it is called the radiation ﬁeld—or, since it is proportional to a,the acceleration ﬁeld. The same terminology applies to the magnetic ﬁeld. Back in Chapter 2, I commented that if we could write down the formula for the force one charge exerts on another, we would be done with electrodynamics, in principle. That, together with the superposition principle, would tell us the force exerted on a test charge Q by any conﬁguration whatsoever. Well ...here we are: Eqs. 10.72 and 10.73 give us the ﬁelds, and the Lorentz force law determines the resulting force: F = qQ 4π(0 r (r · u)3 { [(c2 − v2)u + r × (u × a)] + V c × [ r ×[(c2 − v2)u + r × (u × a)]] } , (10.74) where V is the velocity of Q, and r, u, v, and a are all evaluated at the retarded time. The entire theory of classical electrodynamics is contained in that equa- tion ...but you see why I preferred to start out with Coulomb’s law. Example 10.4. Calculate the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a point charge mov- ing with constant velocity. Solution Putting a = 0 in Eq. 10.72, E = q 4π(0 (c2 − v2)r (r · u)3 u. 10.3 Point Charges 461 In this case, using w = vt, ru = cr − rv = c(r − vtr ) − c(t − tr )v = c(r − vt). In Ex. 10.3 we found that rc − r · v = r · u = √ (c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r 2 − c2t 2). In Prob. 10.16 you showed that this radical could be written as Rc√1 − v2 sin 2 θ/c2, where R ≡ r − vt is the vector from the present location of the particle to r, and θ is the angle between R and v (Fig. 10.9). Thus E(r, t) = q 4π(0 1 − v2/c2 ( 1 − v2 sin 2 θ/c2)3/2 ˆR R2 . (10.75) E v FIGURE 10.10 Notice that E points along the line from the present position of the particle. This is an extraordinary coincidence, since the “message” came from the retarded position. Because of the sin 2 θ in the denominator, the ﬁeld of a fast-moving charge is ﬂattened out like a pancake in the direction perpendicular to the mo- tion (Fig. 10.10). In the forward and backward directions E is reduced by a factor (1 − v2/c2) relative to the ﬁeld of a charge at rest; in the perpendicular direction it is enhanced by a factor 1/ √1 − v2/c2. As for B,wehave ˆr = r − vtr r = (r − vt) + (t − tr )v r = R r + v c , 462 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields and therefore B = 1 c (ˆr × E) = 1 c2 (v × E). (10.76) Lines of B circle around the charge, as shown in Fig. 10.11. B v FIGURE 10.11 The ﬁelds of a point charge moving at constant velocity (Eqs. 10.75 and 10.76) were ﬁrst obtained by Oliver Heaviside in 1888.20 When v2 ≪ c2 they reduce to E(r, t) ≈ 1 4π(0 q R2 ˆR; B(r, t) ≈ μ0 4π q R2 (v × ˆR). (10.77) The ﬁrst is essentially Coulomb’s law, and the second is the “Biot-Savart law for a point charge” I warned you about in Chapter 5 (Eq. 5.43). Problem 10.19 Derive Eq. 10.70. First show that ∂tr ∂t = rc r · u . (10.78) Problem 10.20 Suppose a point charge q is constrained to move along the x axis. Show that the ﬁelds at points on the axis to the right of the charge are given by E = q 4π(0 1 r2 ( c + v c − v ) ˆx, B = 0. (Do not assume v is constant!) What are the ﬁelds on the axis to the left of the charge? Problem 10.21 For a point charge moving at constant velocity, calculate the ﬂux integral ∮ E · da (using Eq. 10.75), over the surface of a sphere centered at the present location of the charge.21 20For history and references, see O. J. Jeﬁmenko, Am.J.Phys. 62, 79 (1994). 21Feynman was fond of saying you should never begin a calculation before you know the answer. It doesn’t always work, but this is a good problem to try it on. 10.3 Point Charges 463 Problem 10.22 (a) Use Eq. 10.75 to calculate the electric ﬁeld a distance d from an inﬁnite straight wire carrying a uniform line charge λ, moving at a constant speed v down the wire. (b) Use Eq. 10.76 to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld of this wire. Problem 10.23 For the conﬁguration in Prob. 10.15, ﬁnd the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the center. From your formula for B, determine the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of a circular loop carrying a steady current I , and compare your answer with the result of Ex. 5.6 More Problems on Chapter 10 Problem 10.24 Suppose you take a plastic ring of radius a and glue charge on it, so that the line charge density is λ0| sin(θ/2)|. Then you spin the loop about its axis at an angular velocity ω. Find the (exact) scalar and vector potentials at the center of the ring. [ Answer: A = (μ0λ0ωa/3π) { sin[ω(t − a/c)] ˆx − cos[ω(t − a/c)] ˆy }] Problem 10.25 Figure 2.35 summarizes the laws of electrostatics in a “triangle diagram” relating the source (ρ), the ﬁeld (E), and the potential (V ). Figure 5.48 does the same for magnetostatics, where the source is J, the ﬁeld is B, and the potential is A. Construct the analogous diagram for electrodynamics, with sources ρ and J (constrained by the continuity equation), ﬁelds E and B, and potentials V and A (constrained by the Lorenz gauge condition). Do not include formulas for V and A in terms of E and B. Problem 10.26 An expanding sphere, radius R(t) = vt (t > 0, constant v) carries acharge Q, uniformly distributed over its volume. Evaluate the integral Qeff = ∫ ρ(r, tr ) dτ with respect to the center. Show that Qeff ≈ Q(1 − 3v 4c ),if v ≪ c. Problem 10.27 Check that the potentials of a point charge moving at constant ve- locity (Eqs. 10.49 and 10.50) satisfy the Lorenz gauge condition (Eq. 10.12). Problem 10.28 One particle, of charge q1, is held at rest at the origin. Another particle, of charge q2, approaches along the x axis, in hyperbolic motion: x(t) = √ b2 + (ct)2 ; it reaches the closest point, b, at time t = 0, and then returns out to inﬁnity. (a) What is the force F2 on q2 (due to q1) at time t? (b) What total impulse (I2 = ∫ ∞ −∞ F2dt) is delivered to q2 by q1? 464 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields (c) What is the force F1 on q1 (due to q2) at time t? (d) What total impulse (I1 = ∫ ∞ −∞ F1dt) is delivered to q1 by q2?[Hint: It might help to review Prob. 10.17 before doing this integral. Answer: I2 =−I1 = q1q2/4(0bc] Problem 10.29 We are now in a position to treat the example in Sect. 8.2.1 quanti- tatively. Suppose q1 is at x1 =−vt and q2 is at y =−vt (Fig. 8.3, with t < 0). Find the electric and magnetic forces on q1 and q2. Is Newton’s third law obeyed? Problem 10.30 A uniformly charged rod (length L, charge density λ) slides out the x axis at constant speed v. At time t = 0 the back end passes the origin (so its position as a function of time is x = vt, while the front end is at x = vt + L). Find the retarded scalar potential at the origin, as a function of time, for t > 0. [First determine the retarded time t1 for the back end, the retarded time t2 for the front end, and the corresponding retarded positions x1 and x2.] Is your answer consistent with the Liénard-Wiechert potential, in the point charge limit (L ≪ vt, with λL = q)?

When charges accelerate, their ﬁelds can transport energy irreversibly out to inﬁnity—a process we call radiation.1 Let us assume the source is localized 2 near the origin; we would like to calculate the energy it is radiating at time t0. Imagine a gigantic sphere, out at radius r (Fig. 11.1) The power passing through its surface is the integral of the Poynting vector: P(r, t) = √ S · da = 1 μ0 √ (E × B) · da. (11.1) Because electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light, 3 this energy actually left the source at the earlier time t0 = t − r/c, so the power radiated is Prad(t0) = lim r →∞ P ( r, t0 + r c ) (11.2) r Source FIGURE 11.1 1In this chapter, the word “radiation” is used in a restricted technical sense—it might better be called “radiation to inﬁnity.” In everyday language the word has a broader connotation. We speak, for example, of radiation from a heat lamp or an x-ray machine. In this more general sense, electromag- netic “radiation” applies to any ﬁelds that transport energy—which is to say, ﬁelds whose Poynting vector is non-zero. There is nothing wrong with that language, but it is not how I am using the term here. 2For nonlocalized conﬁgurations, such as inﬁnite planes, wires, or solenoids, the concept of “radia- tion” must be reformulated (Prob. 11.28). 3More precisely, the ﬁelds depend on the status of the source at the retarded time. 466 11.1 Dipole Radiation 467 (with t0 held constant). This is energy (per unit time) that is carried away and never comes back. Now, the area of the sphere is 4πr 2, so for radiation to occur the Poynting vec- tor must decrease (at large r ) no faster than 1/r 2 (if it went like 1/r 3, for example, then P would go like 1/r , and Prad would be zero). According to Coulomb’s law, electrostatic ﬁelds fall off like 1/r 2 (or even faster, if the total charge is zero), and the Biot-Savart law says that magnetostatic ﬁelds go like 1/r 2 (or faster), which means that S ∼ 1/r 4, for static conﬁgurations. So static sources do not radiate. But Jeﬁmenko’s equations (Eqs. 10.36 and 10.38) indicate that time-dependent ﬁelds include terms (involving ˙ρ and ˙J) that go like 1/r ; these are the terms that are responsible for electromagnetic radiation. The study of radiation, then, involves picking out the parts of E and B that go like 1/r at large distances from the source, constructing from them the 1/r 2 term in S, integrating over a large spherical 4 surface, and taking the limit as r →∞. I’ll carry through this procedure ﬁrst for oscillating electric and magnetic dipoles; then, in Sect. 11.2, we’ll consider the more difﬁcult case of radiation from an accelerating point charge. 11.1.2 Electric Dipole Radiation Picture two tiny metal spheres separated by a distance d and connected by a ﬁne wire (Fig. 11.2); at time t the charge on the upper sphere is q(t), and the charge on the lower sphere is −q(t). Suppose that we drive the charge back and forth through the wire, from one end to the other, at an angular frequency ω: q(t) = q0 cos(ωt). (11.3) The result is an oscillating electric dipole:5 p(t) = p0 cos(ωt) ˆz, (11.4) where p0 ≡ q0d is the maximum value of the dipole moment. The retarded potential (Eq. 10.26) is V (r, t) = 1 4π.0 { q0 cos[ω(t − r+/c)] r+ − q0 cos[ω(t − r−/c)] r− } , (11.5) where, by the law of cosines, r± = √ r 2 ∓ rd cos θ + (d/2)2. (11.6) 4It doesn’t have to be a sphere, of course, but this makes the calculations a lot easier. 5It might occur to you that a more natural model would consist of equal and opposite charges mounted on a spring, say, so that q is constant while d oscillates, instead of the other way around. Such a model would lead to the same result, but moving point charges are hard to work with, and this formulation is much simpler. 468 Chapter 11 Radiation z y d r+ r− r θ +q −q FIGURE 11.2 Now, to make this physical dipole into a perfect dipole, we want the separation distance to be extremely small: approximation 1 : d ≪ r. (11.7) Of course, if d is zero we get no potential at all; what we want is an expansion carried to ﬁrst order in d. Thus r± ∼= r ( 1 ∓ d 2r cos θ ) . (11.8) It follows that 1 r± ∼= 1 r ( 1 ± d 2r cos θ ) , (11.9) and cos[ω(t − r±/c)] ∼= cos [ω(t − r/c) ± ωd 2c cos θ ] = cos[ω(t − r/c)] cos ( ωd 2c cos θ ) ∓ sin[ω(t − r/c)] sin ( ωd 2c cos θ ) . In the perfect dipole limit we have, further, approximation 2 : d ≪ c ω . (11.10) (Since waves of frequency ω have a wavelength λ = 2π c/ω, this amounts to the requirement d ≪ λ.) Under these conditions, cos[ω(t − r±/c)] ∼= cos[ω(t − r/c)]∓ ωd 2c cos θ sin[ω(t − r/c)]. (11.11) 11.1 Dipole Radiation 469 Putting Eqs. 11.9 and 11.11 into Eq. 11.5, we obtain the potential of an oscil- lating perfect dipole: V (r,θ, t) = p0 cos θ 4π.0r { − ω c sin[ω(t − r/c)]+ 1 r cos[ω(t − r/c)]} . (11.12) In the static limit (ω → 0) the second term reproduces the old formula for the potential of a stationary dipole (Eq. 3.102): V = p0 cos θ 4π.0r 2 . This is not, however, the term that concerns us now; we are interested in the ﬁelds that survive at large distances from the source, in the so-called radiation zone: 6 approximation 3 : r ≫ c ω (11.13) (or, in terms of the wavelength, r ≫ λ). In this region the potential reduces to V (r,θ, t) =− p0ω 4π.0c ( cos θ r ) sin[ω(t − r/c)]. (11.14) Meanwhile, the vector potential is determined by the current ﬂowing in the wire: I(t) = dq dt ˆz =−q0ω sin(ωt) ˆz. (11.15) Referring to Fig. 11.3, A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ d/2 −d/2 −q0ω sin[ω(t − r/c)] ˆz r dz. (11.16) z dz y r r θ +q −q FIGURE 11.3 6Note that approximations 2 and 3 subsume approximation 1; all together, we have d ≪ λ ≪ r . 470 Chapter 11 Radiation Because the integration itself introduces a factor of d, we can, to ﬁrst order, replace the integrand by its value at the center: A(r,θ, t) =− μ0 p0ω 4πr sin[ω(t − r/c)] ˆz. (11.17) (Notice that whereas I implicitly used approximations 1 and 2, in keeping only the ﬁrst order in d, Eq. 11.17 is not subject to approximation 3.) From the potentials, it is a straightforward matter to compute the ﬁelds. ∇V = ∂ V ∂r ˆr + 1 r ∂ V ∂θ ˆθ =− p0ω 4π.0c { cos θ ( − 1 r 2 sin[ω(t − r/c)]− ω rc cos[ω(t − r/c)]) ˆr − sin θ r 2 sin[ω(t − r/c)] ˆθ } ∼= p0ω2 4π.0c2 ( cos θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆr. (I dropped the ﬁrst and last terms, in accordance with approximation 3.) Likewise, ∂A ∂t =− μ0 p0ω2 4πr cos[ω(t − r/c)](cos θ ˆr − sin θ ˆθ), and therefore E =−∇V − ∂A ∂t =− μ0 p0ω2 4π ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆθ . (11.18) Meanwhile ∇ × A = 1 r [ ∂ ∂r (rAθ ) − ∂ Ar ∂θ ] ˆφ =− μ0 p0ω 4πr { ω c sin θ cos[ω(t − r/c)]+ sin θ r sin[ω(t − r/c)]} ˆφ. The second term is again eliminated by approximation 3, so B = ∇ × A =− μ0 p0ω2 4π c ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆφ. (11.19) Equations 11.18 and 11.19 represent monochromatic waves of frequency ω traveling in the radial direction at the speed of light. The ﬁelds are in phase, 11.1 Dipole Radiation 471 FIGURE 11.4 mutually perpendicular, and transverse; the ratio of their amplitudes is E0/B0 = c. All of which is precisely what we expect for electromagnetic waves in free space. (These are actually spherical waves, not plane waves, and their amplitude decreases like 1/r as they progress. But for large r , they are approximately plane over small regions—just as the surface of the earth is reasonably ﬂat, locally.) The energy radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is determined by the Poynting vector: S(r, t) = 1 μ0 (E × B) = μ0 c { p0ω2 4π ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)]}2 ˆr. (11.20) The intensity is obtained by averaging (in time) over a complete cycle: ⟨S⟩= ( μ0 p2 0ω4 32π 2c ) sin 2 θ r 2 ˆr. (11.21) Notice that there is no radiation along the axis of the dipole (here sin θ = 0); the intensity proﬁle 7 takes the form of a donut, with its maximum in the equatorial plane (Fig. 11.4). The total power radiated is found by integrating ⟨S⟩ over a sphere of radius r : ⟨P⟩= ∫ ⟨S⟩· da = μ0 p2 0ω4 32π 2c ∫ sin 2 θ r 2 r 2 sin θ dθ dφ = μ0 p2 0ω4 12πc . (11.22) Example 11.1. The strong frequency dependence of the power formula is what accounts for the blueness of the sky. Sunlight passing through the atmosphere stimulates atoms to oscillate as tiny dipoles. The incident solar radiation covers a broad range of frequencies (white light), but the energy absorbed and reradiated by the atmospheric dipoles is stronger at the higher frequencies because of the ω4 in Eq. 11.22. It is more intense in the blue, then, than in the red. It is this reradiated light that you see when you look up in the sky—unless, of course, you’re staring directly at the sun. Because electromagnetic waves are transverse, the dipoles oscillate in a plane orthogonal to the sun’s rays. In the celestial arc perpendicular to these rays, where 7The radial coordinate in Fig. 11.4 represents the magnitude of ⟨S⟩ in that direction. 472 Chapter 11 Radiation Sun’s rays This dipole radiates to the observer This dipole does not radiate to the observer FIGURE 11.5 the blueness is most pronounced, the dipoles oscillating along the line of sight send no radiation to the observer (because of the sin2 θ in equation Eq. 11.21); light received at this angle is therefore polarized perpendicular to the sun’s rays (Fig. 11.5). The redness of sunset is the other side of the same coin: Sunlight coming in at a tangent to the earth’s surface must pass through a much longer stretch of atmosphere than sunlight coming from overhead (Fig. 11.6). Accordingly, much of the blue has been removed by scattering, and what’s left is red. Atmosphere (thickness grossly exaggerated) Sun's rays FIGURE 11.6 Problem 11.1 Check that the retarded potentials of an oscillating dipole (Eqs. 11.12 and 11.17) satisfy the Lorenz gauge condition. Do not use approximation 3. Problem 11.2 Equation 11.14 can be expressed in “coordinate-free” form by writing p0 cos θ = p0 · ˆr. Do so, and likewise for Eqs. 11.17, 11.18. 11.19, and 11.21. Problem 11.3 Find the radiation resistance of the wire joining the two ends of the dipole. (This is the resistance that would give the same average power loss—to heat—as the oscillating dipole in fact puts out in the form of radiation.) Show that R = 790 (d/λ)2 >,where λ is the wavelength of the radiation. For the wires in an ordinary radio (say, d = 5 cm), should you worry about the radiative contribution to the total resistance? 11.1 Dipole Radiation 473 Problem 11.4 A rotating electric dipole can be thought of as the superposition! of two oscillating dipoles, one along the x axis and the other along the y axis (Fig. 11.7), with the latter out of phase by 90 ◦: p = p0[cos(ωt) ˆx + sin(ωt) ˆy]. y x ωt +q −q p FIGURE 11.7 Using the principle of superposition and Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19 (perhaps in the form suggested by Prob. 11.2), ﬁnd the ﬁelds of a rotating dipole. Also ﬁnd the Poynting vector and the intensity of the radiation. Sketch the intensity proﬁle as a function of the polar angle θ , and calculate the total power radiated. Does the answer seem reasonable? (Note that power, being quadratic in the ﬁelds, does not satisfy the superposition principle. In this instance, however, it seems to. How do you account for this?) 11.1.3 Magnetic Dipole Radiation Suppose now that we have a wire loop of radius b (Fig. 11.8), around which we drive an alternating current: I (t) = I0 cos(ωt). (11.23) This is a model for an oscillating magnetic dipole, m(t) = π b2 I (t) ˆz = m0 cos(ωt) ˆz, (11.24) y z b r dl′ x φ′ ψ θ r FIGURE 11.8 474 Chapter 11 Radiation where m0 ≡ π b2 I0 (11.25) is the maximum value of the magnetic dipole moment. The loop is uncharged, so the scalar potential is zero. The retarded vector potential is A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ I0 cos[ω(t − r/c)] r dl′. (11.26) For a point r directly above the x axis (Fig. 11.8), A must aim in the y direction, since the x components from symmetrically placed points on either side of the x axis will cancel. Thus A(r, t) = μ0 I0b 4π ˆy ∫ 2π 0 cos[ω(t − r/c)] r cos φ′ dφ′ (11.27) (cos φ′ serves to pick out the y-component of dl′). By the law of cosines, r = √ r 2 + b2 − 2rb cos ψ, where ψ is the angle between the vectors r and b: r = r sin θ ˆx + r cos θ ˆz, b = b cos φ′ ˆx + b sin φ′ ˆy. So rb cos ψ = r · b = rb sin θ cos φ′, and therefore r = √ r 2 + b2 − 2rb sin θ cos φ′. (11.28) For a “perfect” dipole, we want the loop to be extremely small: approximation 1 : b ≪ r. (11.29) To ﬁrst order in b, then, r ∼= r ( 1 − b r sin θ cos φ′) , so 1 r ∼= 1 r ( 1 + b r sin θ cos φ′) (11.30) and cos[ω(t − r/c)] ∼= cos [ω(t − r/c) + ωb c sin θ cos φ′] = cos[ω(t − r/c)] cos ( ωb c sin θ cos φ′) − sin[ω(t − r/c)] sin ( ωb c sin θ cos φ′) . 11.1 Dipole Radiation 475 As before, we also assume the size of the dipole is small compared to the wave- length radiated: approximation 2 : b ≪ c ω . (11.31) In that case, cos[ω(t − r/c)] ∼= cos[ω(t − r/c)]− ωb c sin θ cos φ′ sin[ω(t − r/c)]. (11.32) Inserting Eqs. 11.30 and 11.32 into Eq. 11.27, and dropping the second-order term: A(r, t) ∼= μ0 I0b 4πr ˆy ∫ 2π 0 { cos[ω(t − r/c)]+ b sin θ cos φ′ × ( 1 r cos[ω(t − r/c)]− ω c sin[ω(t − r/c)])} cos φ′ dφ′. The ﬁrst term integrates to zero: ∫ 2π 0 cos φ′ dφ′ = 0. The second term involves the integral of cosine squared: ∫ 2π 0 cos2 φ′ dφ′ = π. Putting this in, and noting that in general A points in the ˆφ-direction, I conclude that the vector potential of an oscillating perfect magnetic dipole is A(r,θ, t) = μ0m0 4π ( sin θ r ){ 1 r cos[ω(t − r/c)]− ω c sin[ω(t − r/c)]} ˆφ. (11.33) In the static limit (ω = 0) we recover the familiar formula for the potential of a magnetic dipole (Eq. 5.87) A(r,θ ) = μ0 4π m0 sin θ r 2 ˆφ. In the radiation zone, approximation 3 : r ≫ c ω , (11.34) the ﬁrst term in A is negligible, so A(r,θ, t) =− μ0m0ω 4π c ( sin θ r ) sin[ω(t − r/c)] ˆφ. (11.35) 476 Chapter 11 Radiation From A we obtain the ﬁelds at large r : E =− ∂A ∂t = μ0m0ω2 4π c ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆφ, (11.36) and B = ∇ × A =− μ0m0ω2 4π c2 ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆθ . (11.37) (I used approximation 3 in calculating B.) These ﬁelds are in phase, mutually per- pendicular, and transverse to the direction of propagation (ˆr), and the ratio of their amplitudes is E0/B0 = c, all of which is as expected for electromagnetic waves. They are, in fact, remarkably similar in structure to the ﬁelds of an oscillating electric dipole (Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19), only this time it is B that points in the ˆθ direction and E in the ˆφ direction, whereas for electric dipoles it’s the other way around. The energy ﬂux for magnetic dipole radiation is S(r, t) = 1 μ0 (E × B) = μ0 c { m0ω2 4π c ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)]}2 ˆr, (11.38) the intensity is ⟨S⟩= ( μ0m2 0ω4 32π 2c3 ) sin 2 θ r 2 ˆr, (11.39) and the total radiated power is ⟨P⟩= μ0m2 0ω4 12πc3 . (11.40) Once again, the intensity proﬁle has the shape of a donut (Fig. 11.4), and the power radiated goes like ω4. There is, however, one important difference between electric and magnetic dipole radiation: For conﬁgurations with compara- ble dimensions, the power radiated electrically is enormously greater. Comparing Eqs. 11.22 and 11.40, Pmagnetic Pelectric = ( m0 p0c )2 , (11.41) where (remember) m0 = π b2 I0, and p0 = q0d. The amplitude of the current in the electrical case was I0 = q0ω (Eq. 11.15). Setting d = π b, for the sake of comparison, I get Pmagnetic Pelectric = ( ωb c )2 . (11.42) 11.1 Dipole Radiation 477 But ωb/c is precisely the quantity we assumed was very small (approximation 2), and here it appears squared. Ordinarily, then, one should expect electric dipole radiation to dominate. Only when the system is carefully contrived to exclude any electric contribution (as in the case just treated) will the magnetic dipole radiation reveal itself. Problem 11.5 Calculate the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of an oscillating magnetic dipole without using approximation 3. [Do they look familiar? Compare Prob. 9.35.] Find the Poynting vector, and show that the intensity of the radiation is exactly the same as we got using approximation 3. Problem 11.6 Find the radiation resistance (Prob. 11.3) for the oscillating magnetic dipole in Fig. 11.8. Express your answer in terms of λ and b, and compare the radiation resistance of the electric dipole. [Answer: 3 × 105 (b/λ)4 >] Problem 11.7 Use the “duality” transformation of Prob. 7.64, together with the ﬁelds of an oscillating electric dipole (Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19), to determine the ﬁelds that would be produced by an oscillating “Gilbert” magnetic dipole (composed of equal and opposite magnetic charges, instead of an electric current loop). Compare Eqs. 11.36 and 11.37, and comment on the result. 11.1.4 Radiation from an Arbitrary Source In the previous sections, we studied the radiation produced by two speciﬁc sys- tems: oscillating electric dipoles and oscillating magnetic dipoles. Now I want to apply the same procedures to a conﬁguration of charge and current that is entirely arbitrary, except that it is localized within some ﬁnite volume near the origin (Fig. 11.9). The retarded scalar potential is V (r, t) = 1 4π.0 ∫ ρ(r ′, t − r/c) r dτ ′, (11.43) where r = √ r 2 + r ′2 − 2r · r′. (11.44) dτ′ r r r′ y z x FIGURE 11.9 478 Chapter 11 Radiation As before, we shall assume that the ﬁeld point r is far away, in comparison to the dimensions of the source: approximation 1 : r ′ ≪ r. (11.45) (Actually, r ′ is a variable of integration; approximation 1 means that the maximum value of r ′, as it ranges over the source, is much less than r .) On this assumption, r ∼= r ( 1 − r · r ′ r 2 ) , (11.46) so 1 r ∼= 1 r ( 1 + r · r ′ r 2 ) (11.47) and ρ(r ′, t − r/c) ∼= ρ ( r ′, t − r c + ˆr · r ′ c ) . Expanding ρ as a Taylor series in t about the retarded time at the origin, t0 ≡ t − r c , (11.48) we have ρ(r ′, t − r/c) ∼= ρ(r ′, t0) +˙ρ(r ′, t0) ( ˆr · r ′ c ) + ... (11.49) where the dot signiﬁes differentiation with respect to time. The next terms in the series would be 1 2 ¨ρ ( ˆr · r ′ c )2 , 1 3! ... ρ ( ˆr · r ′ c )3 ,. . . . We can afford to drop them, provided approximation 2 : r ′ ≪ c |¨ρ/ ˙ρ| , c |... ρ/ ˙ρ|1/2 , c |.... ρ/ ˙ρ|1/3 ,. . . (11.50) For an oscillating system, each of these ratios is c/ω, and we recover the old approximation 2. In the general case it’s more difﬁcult to interpret Eq. 11.50, but as a procedural matter approximations 1 and 2 amount to keeping only the ﬁrst- order terms in r ′. Putting Eqs. 11.47 and 11.49 into the formula for V (Eq. 11.43), and again discarding the second-order term: V (r, t) ∼= 1 4π.0r [∫ ρ(r′, t0) dτ ′ + ˆr r · ∫ r′ρ(r′, t0) dτ ′ + ˆr c · d dt ∫ r′ρ(r′, t0) dτ ′] . 11.1 Dipole Radiation 479 The ﬁrst integral is simply the total charge, Q,attime t0. Because charge is con- served, Q is independent of time. The other two integrals represent the electric dipole moment at time t0. Thus V (r, t) ∼= 1 4π.0 [ Q r + ˆr · p(t0) r 2 + ˆr · ˙p(t0) rc ] . (11.51) In the static case, the ﬁrst two terms are the monopole and dipole contributions to the multipole expansion for V ; the third term, of course, would not be present. Meanwhile, the vector potential is A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r ′, t − r/c) r dτ ′. (11.52) As you’ll see in a moment, to ﬁrst order in r ′ it sufﬁces to replace r by r in the integrand: A(r, t) ∼= μ0 4πr ∫ J(r ′, t0) dτ ′. (11.53) According to Prob. 5.7, the integral of J is the time derivative of the dipole mo- ment, so A(r, t) ∼= μ0 4π ˙p(t0) r . (11.54) Now you see why it was unnecessary to carry the approximation of r beyond the zeroth order (r ∼= r ): p is already ﬁrst order in r ′, and any reﬁnements would be corrections of second order (or higher). Next we must calculate the ﬁelds. Once again, we are interested in the radiation zone (that is, in the ﬁelds that survive at large distances from the source), so we keep only those terms that go like 1/r : approximation 3 : discard 1/r 2 terms in E and B. (11.55) For instance, the Coulomb ﬁeld, E = 1 4π.0 Q r 2 ˆr, coming from the ﬁrst term in Eq. 11.51, does not contribute to the electromag- netic radiation. In fact, the radiation comes entirely from those terms in which we differentiate the argument t0. From Eq. 11.48 it follows that ∇t0 =− 1 c ∇r =− 1 c ˆr, and hence ∇V ∼= ∇ [ 1 4π.0 ˆr · ˙p(t0) rc ] ∼= 1 4π.0 [ ˆr · ¨p(t0) rc ] ∇t0 =− 1 4π.0c2 [ˆr · ¨p(t0)] r ˆr. 480 Chapter 11 Radiation Similarly, ∇ × A ∼= μ0 4πr [∇ × ˙p(t0)]= μ0 4πr [(∇t0) × ¨p(t0)]=− μ0 4πrc [ˆr × ¨p(t0)], while ∂A ∂t ∼= μ0 4π ¨p(t0) r . So E(r, t) ∼= μ0 4πr [(ˆr · ¨p)ˆr − ¨p]= μ0 4πr [ˆr × (ˆr × ¨p)], (11.56) where ¨p is evaluated at time t0 = t − r/c, and B(r, t) ∼= − μ0 4πrc [ˆr × ¨p]. (11.57) In particular, if we use spherical polar coordinates, with the z axis in the direc- tion of ¨p(t0), then E(r,θ, t) ∼= μ0 ¨p(t0) 4π ( sin θ r ) ˆθ, B(r,θ, t) ∼= μ0 ¨p(t0) 4π c ( sin θ r ) ˆφ. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ . (11.58) The Poynting vector is S(r, t) ∼= 1 μ0 (E × B) = μ0 16π 2c [¨p(t0)]2 ( sin 2 θ r 2 ) ˆr, (11.59) the power passing through a giant spherical surface at radius r is P(r, t) = √ S(r, t) · da = μ0 6π c [ ¨p ( t − r c )]2 , and the total radiated power (Eq. 11.2) is Prad(t0) ∼= μ0 6π c [ ¨p(t0)]2 . (11.60) Notice that E and B are mutually perpendicular, transverse to the direction of propagation (ˆr), and in the ratio E/B = c, as always for radiation ﬁelds. 11.1 Dipole Radiation 481 Example 11.2. (a) In the case of an oscillating electric dipole, p(t) = p0 cos(ωt), ¨p(t) =−ω2 p0 cos(ωt), and we recover the results of Sect. 11.1.2. (b) For a single point charge q, the dipole moment is p(t) = qd(t), where d is the position of q with respect to the origin. Accordingly, ¨p(t) = qa(t), where a is the acceleration of the charge. In this case the power radiated (Eq. 11.60) is P = μ0q 2a2 6π c . (11.61) This is the famous Larmor formula; I’ll derive it again, by rather different means, in the next section. Notice that the power radiated by a point charge is proportional to the square of its acceleration. What I have done in this section amounts to a multipole expansion of the retarded potentials, carried to the lowest order in r ′ that is capable of produc- ing electromagnetic radiation (ﬁelds that go like 1/r ). This turns out to be the electric dipole term. Because charge is conserved, an electric monopole does not radiate—if charge were not conserved, the ﬁrst term in Eq. 11.51 would read Vmono = 1 4π.0 Q(t0) r , and we would get a monopole ﬁeld proportional to 1/r : Emono = 1 4π.0c ˙Q(t0) r ˆr. You might think that a charged sphere whose radius oscillates in and out would radiate, but it doesn’t—the ﬁeld outside, according to Gauss’s law, is exactly (Q/4π.0r 2)ˆr, regardless of the ﬂuctuations in size. (In the acoustical analog, by the way, monopoles do radiate: witness the croak of a bullfrog.) If the electric dipole moment should happen to vanish (or, at any rate, if its second time derivative is zero), then there is no electric dipole radiation, and one must look to the next term: the one of second order in r ′. As it happens, this term can be separated into two parts, one of which is related to the magnetic dipole 482 Chapter 11 Radiation moment of the source, the other to its electric quadrupole moment. (The former is a generalization of the magnetic dipole radiation we considered in Sect. 11.1.3.) If the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions vanish, the (r ′)3 term must be considered. This yields magnetic quadrupole and electric octopole radia- tion . . . and so it goes. Problem 11.8 A parallel-plate capacitor C, with plate separation d, is given an initial charge (±)Q0. It is then connected to a resistor R, and discharges, Q(t) = Q0e−t/RC . (a) What fraction of its initial energy (Q2 0/2C) does it radiate away? (b) If C = 1pF, R = 1000 >,and d = 0.1 mm, what is the actual number?Inelec- tronics we don’t ordinarily worry about radiative losses; does that seem reason- able, in this case? Problem 11.9 Apply Eqs. 11.59 and 11.60 to the rotating dipole of Prob. 11.4. Explain any apparent discrepancies with your previous answer. Problem 11.10 An insulating circular ring (radius b) lies in the xy plane, centered at the origin. It carries a linear charge density λ = λ0 sin φ,where λ0 is constant and φ is the usual azimuthal angle. The ring is now set spinning at a constant angular velocity ω about the z axis. Calculate the power radiated. Problem 11.11 A current I (t) ﬂows around the circular ring in Fig. 11.8. Derive! the general formula for the power radiated (analogous to Eq. 11.60), expressing your answer in terms of the magnetic dipole moment, m(t), of the loop. [Answer: P = μ0 ¨m2/6π c3] 11.2 POINT CHARGES 11.2.1 Power Radiated by a Point Charge In Chapter 10 we derived the ﬁelds of a point charge q in arbitrary motion (Eqs. 10.72 and 10.73): E(r, t) = q 4π.0 r (r · u)3 [(c2 − v2) u + r × (u × a) ] , (11.62) where u = c ˆr − v, and B(r, t) = 1 c ˆr × E(r, t). (11.63) The ﬁrst term in Eq. 11.62 is the velocity ﬁeld, and the second one (with the triple cross-product) is the acceleration ﬁeld. The Poynting vector is S = 1 μ0 (E × B) = 1 μ0c [E × (ˆr × E)]= 1 μ0c [E 2 ˆr − (ˆr · E)E]. (11.64) 11.2 Point Charges 483 r w(tr) q FIGURE 11.10 However, not all of this energy ﬂux constitutes radiation; some of it is just ﬁeld energy carried along by the particle as it moves. The radiated energy is the stuff that, in effect, detaches itself from the charge and propagates off to inﬁnity. (It’s like ﬂies breeding on a garbage truck: Some of them hover around the truck as it makes its rounds; others ﬂy away and never come back.) To calculate the total power radiated by the particle at time tr , we draw a huge sphere of radius r (Fig. 11.10), centered at the position of the particle (at time tr ), wait the appropri- ate interval t − tr = r c (11.65) for the radiation to reach the sphere, and at that moment integrate the Poynting vector over the surface. 8 I have used the notation tr because, in fact, this is the retarded time for all points on the sphere at time t. Now, the area of the sphere is proportional to r 2, so any term in S that goes like 1/r2 will yield a ﬁnite answer, but terms like 1/r3 or 1/r4 will contribute nothing in the limit r →∞. For this reason, only the acceleration ﬁelds represent true radiation (hence their other name, radiation ﬁelds): Erad = q 4π.0 r (r · u)3 [r × (u × a)]. (11.66) The velocity ﬁelds carry energy, to be sure, and as the charge moves this energy is dragged along—but it’s not radiation. (It’s like the ﬂies that stay with the garbage truck.) Now Erad is perpendicular to ˆr, so the second term in Eq. 11.64 vanishes: Srad = 1 μ0c E 2 rad ˆr. (11.67) If the charge is instantaneously at rest (at time tr ), then u = c ˆr, and Erad = q 4π.0c2r [ˆr × (ˆr × a)]= μ0q 4πr [(ˆr · a) ˆr − a]. (11.68) 8Note the subtle change in strategy here: In Sect. 11.1 we worked from a ﬁxed point (the origin), but here it is more appropriate to use the (moving) location of the charge. The implications of this change in perspective will become clearer in a moment. 484 Chapter 11 Radiation a r θ FIGURE 11.11 In that case Srad = 1 μ0c ( μ0q 4πr )2 [ a2 − (ˆr · a )2] ˆr = μ0q 2a2 16π 2c ( sin 2 θ r2 ) ˆr, (11.69) where θ is the angle between ˆr and a. No power is radiated in the forward or backward direction—rather, it is emitted in a donut about the direction of instan- taneous acceleration (Fig. 11.11). The total power radiated is P = √ Srad · da = μ0q 2a2 16π 2c ∫ sin 2 θ r2 r 2 sin θ dθ dφ, or P = μ0q 2a2 6π c . (11.70) This, again, is the Larmor formula, which we obtained earlier by a different route (Eq. 11.61). Although I derived them on the assumption that v = 0, Eqs. 11.69 and 11.70 actually hold to good approximation as long as v ≪ c. An exact treatment of the case v ̸= 0 is harder,9 both for the obvious reason that Erad is more complicated, c v FIGURE 11.12 9In the context of special relativity, the condition v = 0 simply represents an astute choice of reference system, with no essential loss of generality. If you can decide how P transforms, you can deduce the general (Liénard) result from the v = 0 (Larmor) formula (see Prob. 12.71). 11.2 Point Charges 485 and also for the more subtle reason that Srad, the rate at which energy passes through the sphere, is not the same as the rate at which energy left the particle. Suppose someone is ﬁring a stream of bullets out the window of a moving car (Fig.11.12). The rate Nt at which the bullets strike a stationary target is not the same as the rate Ng at which they left the gun, because of the motion of the car. In fact, you can easily check that Ng = (1 − v/c)Nt , if the car is moving towards the target, and Ng = ( 1 − ˆr · v c ) Nt for arbitrary directions (here v is the velocity of the car, c is that of the bullets— relative to the ground—and ˆr is a unit vector from car to target). In our case, if dW/dt is the rate at which energy passes through the sphere at radius r, then the rate at which energy left the charge was dW dtr = dW/dt ∂tr /∂t = (r · u rc ) dW dt . (11.71) (I used Eq. 10.78 to express ∂tr /∂t.) But r · u rc = 1 − ˆr · v c , which is precisely the ratio of Ng to Nt ; it’s a purely geometrical factor (the same as in the Doppler effect). The power radiated by the particle into a patch of area r2 sin θ dθ dφ = r 2 d> on the sphere is therefore given by dP d> = (r · u rc ) 1 μ0c E 2 rad r 2 = q 2 16π 2.0 |ˆr × (u × a)|2 (ˆr · u)5 , (11.72) where d> = sin θ dθ dφ is the solid angle into which this power is radiated. Integrating over θ and φ to get the total power radiated is no picnic, and for now I shall simply quote the answer: P = μ0q 2γ 6 6π c ( a2 − ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ v × a c ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 2) , (11.73) where γ ≡ 1/ √1 − v2/c2.Thisis Liénard’s generalization of the Larmor for- mula (to which it reduces when v ≪ c). The factor γ 6 means that the radiated power increases enormously as the particle velocity approaches the speed of light. Example 11.3. Suppose v and a are instantaneously collinear (at time tr ), as, for example, in straight-line motion. Find the angular distribution of the radiation (Eq. 11.72) and the total power emitted. 486 Chapter 11 Radiation Solution In this case (u × a) = c(ˆr × a),so dP d> = q 2c2 16π 2.0 |ˆr × (ˆr × a)|2 (c − ˆr · v)5 . Now ˆr × (ˆr × a) = (ˆr · a) ˆr − a, so |ˆr × (ˆr × a)|2 = a2 − (ˆr · a) 2. In particular, if we let the z axis point along v, then dP d> = μ0q 2a2 16π 2c sin 2 θ (1 − β cos θ)5 , (11.74) where β ≡ v/c. This is consistent, of course, with Eq. 11.69, in the case v = 0. However, for very large v(β ≈ 1) the donut of radiation (Fig. 11.11) is stretched out and pushed forward by the factor (1 − β cos θ)−5, as indicated in Fig. 11.13. Although there is still no radiation in precisely the forward direction, most of it is concentrated within an increasingly narrow cone about the forward direction (see Prob. 11.15). x z v θmax FIGURE 11.13 The total power emitted is found by integrating Eq. 11.74 over all angles: P = ∫ dP d> d> = μ0q 2a2 16π 2c ∫ sin 2 θ (1 − β cos θ)5 sin θ dθ dφ. The φ integral is 2π ;the θ integral is simpliﬁed by the substitution x ≡ cos θ : P = μ0q 2a2 8π c ∫ +1 −1 (1 − x 2) (1 − βx)5 dx. Integration by parts yields 4 3 (1 − β2)−3, and I conclude that P = μ0q 2a2γ 6 6π c . (11.75) This result is consistent with the Liénard formula (Eq. 11.73), for the case of collinear v and a. Notice that the angular distribution of the radiation is the same 11.2 Point Charges 487 whether the particle is accelerating or decelerating; it only depends on the square of a, and is concentrated in the forward direction (with respect to the velocity) in either case. When a high speed electron hits a metal target it rapidly decelerates, giving off what is called bremsstrahlung, or “braking radiation.” What I have described in this example is essentially the classical theory of bremsstrahlung. Problem 11.12 An electron is released from rest and falls under the inﬂuence of gravity. In the ﬁrst centimeter, what fraction of the potential energy lost is radiated away? Problem 11.13 A positive charge q is ﬁred head-on at a distant positive charge Q (which is held stationary), with an initial velocity v0. It comes in, decelerates to v = 0, and returns out to inﬁnity. What fraction of its initial energy ( 1 2 mv2 0)is radiated away? Assume v0 ≪ c, and that you can safely ignore the effect of radiative losses on the motion of the particle. [Answer: (16/45)(q/Q)(v0/c)3.] Problem 11.14 In Bohr’s theory of hydrogen, the electron in its ground state was supposed to travel in a circle of radius 5 × 10−11m, held in orbit by the Coulomb attraction of the proton. According to classical electrodynamics, this electron should radiate, and hence spiral in to the nucleus. Show that v ≪ c for most of the trip (so you can use the Larmor formula), and calculate the lifespan of Bohr’s atom. (Assume each revolution is essentially circular.) Problem 11.15 Find the angle θmax at which the maximum radiation is emitted, in Ex. 11.3 (Fig. 11.13). Show that for ultrarelativistic speeds (v close to c), θmax ∼=√(1 − β)/2. What is the intensity of the radiation in this maximal direction (in the ultrarelativistic case), in proportion to the same quantity for a particle instanta- neously at rest? Give your answer in terms of γ . Problem 11.16 In Ex. 11.3 we assumed the velocity and acceleration were (instan-! taneously, at least) collinear. Carry out the same analysis for the case where they are perpendicular. Choose your axes so that v lies along the z axis and a along the x axis (Fig. 11.14), so that v = v ˆz, a = a ˆx,and ˆr = sin θ cos φ ˆx + sin θ sin φ ˆy + cos θ ˆz. Check that P is consistent with the Liénard formula. [Answer: dP d> = μ0q 2a2 16π 2c [(1 − β cos θ)2 − (1 − β 2) sin 2 θ cos2 φ] (1 − β cos θ)5 , P = μ0q 2a2γ 4 6π c . y z x v a θ φ r FIGURE 11.14 x z v a FIGURE 11.15 488 Chapter 11 Radiation For relativistic velocities (β ≈ 1) the radiation is again sharply peaked in the for- ward direction (Fig. 11.15). The most important application of these formulas is to circular motion—in this case the radiation is called synchrotron radiation.For a relativistic electron, the radiation sweeps around like a locomotive’s headlight as the particle moves.] 11.2.2 Radiation Reaction An accelerating charge radiates. This radiation carries off energy, which comes, ultimately, at the expense of the particle’s kinetic energy. Under the inﬂuence of a given force, therefore, a charged particle accelerates less than a neutral one of the same mass. The radiation exerts a force (Frad) back on the charge—a recoil force, rather like that of a bullet on a gun. In this section I’ll derive the radiation reaction force from conservation of energy. Then, in the next section, I’ll show you the actual mechanism responsible, and derive the reaction force again in the context of a simple model. For a nonrelativistic particle (v ≪ c), the total power radiated is given by the Larmor formula (Eq. 11.70): P = μ0q 2a2 6π c . (11.76) Conservation of energy suggests that this is also the rate at which the particle loses energy, under the inﬂuence of the radiation reaction force Frad: Frad · v =− μ0q 2a2 6π c . (11.77) I say “suggests” advisedly, because this equation is actually wrong. For we cal- culated the radiated power by integrating the Poynting vector over a sphere of “inﬁnite” radius; in this calculation the velocity ﬁelds played no part, since they fall off too rapidly as a function of r to make any contribution. But the velocity ﬁelds do carry energy—they just don’t transport it out to inﬁnity. As the parti- cle accelerates and decelerates, energy is exchanged between it and the velocity ﬁelds, at the same time as energy is irretrievably radiated away by the acceleration ﬁelds. Equation 11.77 accounts only for the latter, but if we want to know the re- coil force exerted by the ﬁelds on the charge, we need to consider the total power lost at any instant, not just the portion that eventually escapes in the form of ra- diation. (The term “radiation reaction” is a misnomer. We should really call it the ﬁeld reaction. In fact, we’ll soon see that Frad is determined by the time deriva- tive of the acceleration and can be nonzero even when the acceleration itself is instantaneously zero, and the particle is not radiating.) The energy lost by the particle in any given time interval, then, must equal the energy carried away by the radiation plus whatever extra energy has been pumped into the velocity ﬁelds. 10 However, if we agree to consider only intervals 10Actually, while the total ﬁeld is the sum of velocity and acceleration ﬁelds, E = Ev + Ea,the energy is proportional to E 2 = E 2 v + 2Ev · Ea + E 2 a and contains three terms: energy stored in the velocity 11.2 Point Charges 489 over which the system returns to its initial state, then the energy in the velocity ﬁelds is the same at both ends, and the only net loss is in the form of radiation. Thus Eq. 11.77, while incorrect instantaneously, is valid on the average: ∫ t2 t1 Frad · v dt =− μ0q 2 6π c ∫ t2 t1 a2 dt, (11.78) with the stipulation that the state of the system is identical at t1 and t2. In the case of periodic motion, for instance, we must integrate over an integral number of full cycles. 11 Now, the right side of Eq. 11.78 can be integrated by parts: ∫ t2 t1 a2 dt = ∫ t2 t1 ( dv dt ) · ( dv dt ) dt = ( v · dv dt )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ t2 t1 − ∫ t2 t1 d 2v dt 2 · v dt. The boundary term drops out, since the velocities and accelerations are identical at t1 and t2, so Eq. 11.78 can be written equivalently as ∫ t2 t1 ( Frad − μ0q 2 6π c ˙a ) · v dt = 0. (11.79) Equation 11.79 will certainly be satisﬁed if Frad = μ0q 2 6π c ˙a. (11.80) This is the Abraham-Lorentz formula for the radiation reaction force. Of course, Eq. 11.79 doesn’t prove Eq. 11.80. It tells you nothing whatever about the component of Frad perpendicular to v, and it only tells you the time average of the parallel component—the average, moreover, over very special time intervals. As we’ll see in the next section, there are other reasons for believing in the Abraham-Lorentz formula, but for now, the best that can be said is that it represents the simplest form the radiation reaction force could take, consistent with conservation of energy. The Abraham-Lorentz formula has disturbing implications, which are not entirely understood a century after the law was ﬁrst proposed. For suppose a particle is subject to no external forces; then Newton’s second law says Frad = μ0q 2 6π c ˙a = ma, ﬁelds alone (E 2 v ), energy radiated away (E 2 a ), and a cross term Ev · Ea. For the sake of simplicity, I’m referring to the combination (E 2 v + 2Ev · Ea) as “energy stored in the velocity ﬁelds.” These terms go like 1/r4 and 1/r3, respectively, so neither one contributes to the radiation. 11For nonperiodic motion the condition that the energy in the velocity ﬁelds be the same at t1 and t2 is more difﬁcult to achieve. It is not enough that the instantaneous velocities and accelerations be equal, since the ﬁelds farther out depend on v and a at earlier times. In principle, then, v and a and all higher derivatives must be identical at t1 and t2. In practice, since the velocity ﬁelds fall off rapidly with r,it is sufﬁcient that v and a be the same over a brief interval prior to t1 and t2. 490 Chapter 11 Radiation from which it follows that a(t) = a0et/τ , (11.81) where τ ≡ μ0q 2 6π mc . (11.82) (In the case of the electron, τ = 6 × 10 −24s.) The acceleration spontaneously increases exponentially with time! This absurd conclusion can be avoided if we insist that a0 = 0, but it turns out that the systematic exclusion of such runaway solutions has an even more unpleasant consequence: If you do apply an external force, the particle starts to respond before the force acts! (See Prob. 11.19.) This acausal preacceleration jumps the gun by only a short time τ ; nevertheless, it is (to my mind) unacceptable that the theory should countenance it at all. 12 Example 11.4. Calculate the radiation damping of a charged particle attached to a spring of natural frequency ω0, driven at frequency ω. Solution The equation of motion is m ¨x = Fspring + Frad + Fdriving =−mω2 0x + mτ ... x + Fdriving. With the system oscillating at frequency ω, x(t) = x0 cos(ωt + δ), so ... x =−ω2 ˙x. Therefore m ¨x + mγ ˙x + mω2 0x = Fdriving, (11.83) and the damping factor γ is given by γ = ω2τ. (11.84) [When I wrote Fdamping =−γ mv, back in Chap. 9 (Eq. 9.152), I assumed for simplicity that the damping was proportional to the velocity. We now know that 12These difﬁculties persist in the relativistic version of the Abraham-Lorentz equation, which can be derived by starting with Liénard’s formula instead of Larmor’s (Prob. 12.72). Perhaps they are telling us that there can be no such thing as a point charge in classical electrodynamics, or maybe they presage the onset of quantum mechanics. For guides to the literature, see Philip Pearle’s chapter in D. Teplitz, ed., Electromagnetism: Paths to Research (New York: Plenum, 1982) and F. Rohrlich, Am. J. Phys. 65, 1051 (1997). 11.2 Point Charges 491 radiation damping, at least, is proportional to ¨v. But it hardly matters: for sinu- soidal oscillations any even number of derivatives of v would do, since they’re all proportional to v.] Problem 11.17 (a) A particle of charge q moves in a circle of radius R at a constant speed v.To sustain the motion, you must, of course, provide a centripetal force mv2/R; what additional force (Fe) must you exert, in order to counteract the radia- tion reaction? [It’s easiest to express the answer in terms of the instantaneous velocity v.] What power (Pe) does this extra force deliver? Compare Pe with the power radiated (use the Larmor formula). (b) Repeat part (a) for a particle in simple harmonic motion with amplitude A and angular frequency ω: w(t) = A cos(ωt) ˆz. Explain the discrepancy. (c) Consider the case of a particle in free fall (constant acceleration g). What is the radiation reaction force? What is the power radiated? Comment on these results. Problem 11.18 A point charge q,ofmass m, is attached to a spring of constant k. At time t = 0 it is given a kick, so its initial energy is U0 = 1 2 mv2 0. Now it oscillates, gradually radiating away this energy. (a) Conﬁrm that the total energy radiated is equal to U0. Assume the radiation damping is small, so you can write the equation of motion as ¨x + γ ˙x + ω2 0 x = 0, and the solution as x(t) = v0 ω0 e−γ t/2 sin(ω0t), with ω0 ≡ √k/m, γ = ω2 0τ ,and γ ≪ ω0 (drop γ 2 in comparison to ω2 0,and when you average over a complete cycle, ignore the change in e−γ t ). (b) Suppose now we have two such oscillators, and we start them off with identical kicks. Regardless of their relative positions and orientations, the total energy radiated must be 2U0. But what if they are right on top of each other, so it’s equivalent to a single oscillator with twice the charge; the Larmor formula says that the power radiated is four times as great, suggesting that the total will be 4U0. Find the error in this reasoning, and show that the total is actually 2U0,as it should be.13 Problem 11.19 With the inclusion of the radiation reaction force (Eq. 11.80),! Newton’s second law for a charged particle becomes a = τ ˙a + F m , where F is the external force acting on the particle. 13For a more sophisticated version of this paradox, see P. R. Berman, Am.J.Phys. 78, 1323 (2010). 492 Chapter 11 Radiation (a) In contrast to the case of an uncharged particle (a = F/m), acceleration (like position and velocity) must now be a continuous function of time, even if the force changes abruptly. (Physically, the radiation reaction damps out any rapid change in a.) Prove that a is continuous at any time t, by integrating the equation of motion above from (t − .)to(t + .) and taking the limit . → 0. (b) A particle is subjected to a constant force F, beginning at time t = 0 and lasting until time T . Find the most general solution a(t) to the equation of motion in each of the three periods: (i) t < 0; (ii) 0 < t < T ; (iii) t > T . (c) Impose the continuity condition (a) at t = 0and t = T . Show that you can either eliminate the runaway in region (iii) or avoid preacceleration in region (i), but not both. (d) If you choose to eliminate the runaway, what is the acceleration as a function of time, in each interval? How about the velocity? (The latter must, of course, be continuous at t = 0and t = T .) Assume the particle was originally at rest: v(−∞) = 0. (e) Plot a(t) and v(t), both for an uncharged particle and for a (nonrunaway) charged particle, subject to this force. 11.2.3 The Mechanism Responsible for the Radiation Reaction In the last section, I derived the Abraham-Lorentz formula for the radiation re- action, using conservation of energy. I made no attempt to identify the actual mechanism responsible for this force, except to point out that it must be a recoil effect of the particle’s own ﬁelds acting back on the charge. Unfortunately, the ﬁelds of a point charge blow up right at the particle, so it’s hard to see how one can calculate the force they exert.14 Let’s avoid this problem by considering an extended charge distribution, for which the ﬁeld is ﬁnite everywhere; at the end, we’ll take the limit as the size of the charge goes to zero. In general, the electro- magnetic force of one part (A) on another part (B)is not equal and opposite to the force of B on A (Fig. 11.16). If the distribution is divided up into inﬁnitesimal chunks, and the imbalances are added up for all such pairs, the result is a net force of the charge on itself. It is this self-force, resulting from the breakdown of New- ton’s third law within the structure of the particle, that accounts for the radiation reaction. Lorentz originally calculated the electromagnetic self-force using a spherical charge distribution, which seems reasonable but makes the mathematics rather cumbersome. 15 Because I am only trying to elucidate the mechanism involved, I shall use a less realistic model: a “dumbbell” in which the total charge q is divided into two halves separated by a ﬁxed distance d (Fig. 11.17). This is the simplest possible arrangement of the charge that permits the essential mechanism 14It can be done by a suitable averaging of the ﬁeld, but it’s not easy. See T. H. Boyer, Am. J. Phys. 40, 1843 (1972), and references cited there. 15See J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1999), Sect. 16.3. 11.2 Point Charges 493 A B FIGURE 11.16 r y x q/2 q/2 d (2) (1) Retarded position x(tr) Present position x(t) l FIGURE 11.17 (imbalance of internal electromagnetic forces) to function. Never mind that it’s an unlikely model for an elementary particle: in the point limit (d → 0) any model must yield the Abraham-Lorentz formula, to the extent that conservation of energy alone dictates that answer. Let’s assume the dumbbell moves in the x direction, and is (instantaneously) at rest at the retarded time. The electric ﬁeld at (1) due to (2) is E1 = (q/2) 4π.0 r (r · u)3 [ (c2 + r · a)u − (r · u)a ] (11.85) (Eq. 10.72), where u = c ˆr and r = l ˆx + d ˆy, (11.86) so that r · u = cr, r · a = la, and r = √ l 2 + d 2. (11.87) Actually, we’re only interested in the x component of E1, since the y compo- nents will cancel when we add the forces on the two ends (for the same reason, we don’t need to worry about the magnetic forces). Now u x = cl r , (11.88) and hence E1x = q 8π.0c2 (lc2 − ad 2) (l 2 + d 2)3/2 . (11.89) By symmetry, E2x = E1x , so the net force on the dumbbell is Fself = q 2 (E1 + E2) = q 2 8π.0c2 (lc2 − ad 2) (l 2 + d 2)3/2 ˆx. (11.90) 494 Chapter 11 Radiation So far everything is exact. The idea now is to expand in powers of d; when the size of the particle goes to zero, all positive powers will disappear. Using Taylor’s theorem x(t) = x(tr ) +˙x(tr )(t − tr ) + 1 2 ¨x(tr )(t − tr )2 + 1 3! ... x(tr )(t − tr )3 + ··· , we have, l = x(t) − x(tr ) = 1 2 aT 2 + 1 6 ˙aT 3 + ··· , (11.91) where T ≡ t − tr , for short. Now T is determined by the retarded time condition (cT )2 = l 2 + d 2, (11.92) so d = √(cT )2 − l 2 = cT √ 1− ( aT 2c + ˙aT 2 6c + ··· )2 = cT − a2 8c T 3 + ()T 4 + ··· . This equation tells us d, in terms of T ; we need to “solve” it for T as a function of d. There’s a systematic procedure for doing this, known as reversion of series, 16 but we can get the ﬁrst couple of terms more informally as follows: Ignoring all higher powers of T , d ∼= cT ⇒ T ∼= d c ; using this as an approximation for the cubic term, d ∼= cT − a2 8c d 3 c3 ⇒ T ∼= d c + a2d 3 8c5 , and so on. Thus T = 1 c d + a2 8c5 d 3 + ()d 4 + ··· . (11.93) Returning to Eq. 11.91, we construct the power series for l in terms of d: l = a 2c2 d 2 + ˙a 6c3 d 3 + ()d 4 + ··· . (11.94) Putting this into Eq. 11.90, I conclude that Fself = q 2 4π.0 [ − a 4c2d + ˙a 12c3 + ()d + ··· ] ˆx. (11.95) 16See, for example, the CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulas, 32 ed. (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2011). 11.2 Point Charges 495 Here a and ˙a are evaluated at the retarded time (tr ), but it’s easy to rewrite the result in terms of the present time t: a(tr ) = a(t) +˙a(t)(tr − t) + ··· = a(t) −˙a(t)T + ··· = a(t) −˙a(t) d c + ··· , and it follows that Fself = q 2 4π.0 [ − a(t) 4c2d + ˙a(t) 3c3 + ()d + ··· ] ˆx. (11.96) The ﬁrst term on the right is proportional to the acceleration of the charge; if we pull it over to the other side of Newton’s second law, it simply adds to the dumbbell’s mass. In effect, the total inertia of the charged dumbbell is m = 2m0 + 1 4π.0 q 2 4dc2 , (11.97) where m0 is the mass of either end alone. In the context of special relativity, it is not surprising that the electrical repulsion of the charges should enhance the mass of the dumbbell. For the potential energy of this conﬁguration (in the static case) is 1 4π.0 (q/2) 2 d , (11.98) and according to Einstein’s formula E = mc2, this energy contributes to the iner- tia of the object. 17 The second term in Eq. 11.96 is the radiation reaction: F int rad = μ0q 2 ˙a 12πc . (11.99) It alone (apart from the mass correction 18) survives in the “point dumbbell” limit d → 0. Unfortunately, it differs from the Abraham-Lorentz formula by a factor of 2. But then, this is only the self-force associated with the interaction between 1 and 2—hence the superscript “int.” There remains the force of each end on itself. When the latter is included (see Prob. 11.20), the result is Frad = μ0q 2 ˙a 6π c , (11.100) 17The fact that the numbers work out perfectly is a lucky feature of this conﬁguration. If you do the same calculation for the dumbbell in longitudinal motion, the mass correction is only half of what it “should” be (there’s a 2, instead of a 4, in Eq. 11.97), and for a sphere it’s off by a factor of 3/4. This notorious paradox has been the subject of much debate over the years. See D. J. Grifﬁths and R. E. Owen, Am. J. Phys. 51, 1120 (1983). 18Of course, the limit d → 0 has an embarrassing effect on the mass term. In a sense, it doesn’t matter, since only the total mass m is observable; maybe m0 somehow has a compensating (negative!) inﬁnity, so that m comes out ﬁnite. This awkward problem persists in quantum electrodynamics, where it is “swept under the rug” in a procedure known as mass renormalization. 496 Chapter 11 Radiation reproducing the Abraham-Lorentz formula exactly. Conclusion: The radiation reaction is due to the force of the charge on itself—or, more elaborately, the net force exerted by the ﬁelds generated by different parts of the charge distribution acting on one another. Problem 11.20 Deduce Eq. 11.100 from Eq. 11.99. Here are three methods: (a) Use the Abraham-Lorentz formula to determine the radiation reaction on each end of the dumbbell; add this to the interaction term (Eq. 11.99). (b) Method (a) has the defect that it uses the Abraham-Lorentz formula—the very thing that we were trying to derive. To avoid this, let F(q) be the total d-independent part of the self-force on a charge q.Then F(q) = F int(q) + 2F(q/2), where F int is the interaction part (Eq. 11.99), and F(q/2) is the self-force on each end. Now, F(q) must be proportional to q 2, since the ﬁeld is proportional to q and the force is qE.So F(q/2) = (1/4)F(q). Take it from there. (c) Smear out the charge along a strip of length L oriented perpendicular to the motion (the charge density, then, is λ = q/L); ﬁnd the cumulative interaction force for all pairs of segments, using Eq. 11.99 (with the correspondence q/2 → λ dy1, at one end and q/2 → λ dy2 at the other). Make sure you don’t count the same pair twice. Problem 11.21 19 An electric dipole rotates at constant angular velocity ω in the xy! plane. (The charges, ±q,are at r± =±R(cos ωt ˆx + sin ωt ˆy); the magnitude of the dipole moment is p = 2qR.) (a) Find the interaction term in the self-torque (analogous to Eq. 11.99). Assume the motion is nonrelativistic (ω R ≪ c). (b) Use the method of Prob. 11.20(a) to obtain the total radiation reaction torque on this system. [Answer: − μ0 p2ω3 6π c ˆz.] (c) Check that this result is consistent with the power radiated (Eq. 11.60). More Problems on Chapter 11 Problem 11.22 A particle of mass m and charge q is attached to a spring with force constant k, hanging from the ceiling (Fig. 11.18). Its equilibrium position is a distance h above the ﬂoor. It is pulled down a distance d below equilibrium and released, at time t = 0. (a) Under the usual assumptions (d ≪ λ ≪ h), calculate the intensity of the radi- ation hitting the ﬂoor, as a function of the distance R from the point directly below q.[Note: The intensity here is the average power per unit area of ﬂoor.] 19For related problems, see D.

At the top is a magnetic dipole antenna, of radius b, with its axis vertical. FM station KRUD broadcasts from this antenna at (angular) frequency ω, with a total radiated power P (that’s averaged, of course, over a full cycle). Neighbors have complained about problems they attribute to excessive radiation from the tower—interference with their stereo systems, mechanical garage doors opening and closing mysteri- ously, and a variety of suspicious medical problems. But the city engineer who measured the radiation level at the base of the tower found it to be well below the accepted standard. You have been hired by the Neighborhood Association to assess the engineer’s report. (a) In terms of the variables given (not all of which may be relevant), ﬁnd the formula for the intensity of the radiation at ground level, a distance R from the base of the tower. You may assume that b ≪ c/ω ≪ h.[Note: We are interested only in the magnitude of the radiation, not in its direction—when measurements are taken, the detector will be aimed directly at the antenna.] (b) How far from the base of the tower should the engineer have made the measure- ment? What is the formula for the intensity at this location? (c) KRUD’s actual power output is 35 kilowatts, its frequency is 90 MHz, the antenna’s radius is 6 cm, and the height of the tower is 200 m.

Relative to the ﬁxed axis of rotation, therefore, the magnetic dipole moment of the earth is changing with time, and the earth must be giving off magnetic dipole radiation. (a) Find the formula for the total power radiated, in terms of the following param- eters: \u0010 (the angle between the geographic and magnetic north poles), M (the magnitude of the earth’s magnetic dipole moment), and ω (the angular velocity of rotation of the earth).

Explain what you mean by “radiation,” in this case, given that the source is not localized.22 21Notice that B(r, t) goes like 1/r 2, and one might therefore assume that this conﬁguration does not radiate. However, it is not B(r, t) we require (for Eq. 11.2), but rather B(r, t0 + r/c)—we track the ﬁelds as they propagate out to inﬁnity—and B(r, t0 + r/c) has a term that goes like 1/r . 22For discussion and related problems, see B.

Show that, because of the radiation reaction, it is possible for the particle to tunnel through the barrier—that is, even if the incident kinetic energy is less than U0,the particle can pass through.26 [Hint: Your task is to solve the equation a = τ ˙a + F m , subject to the force F(x) = U0[−δ(x) + δ(x − L)]. Refer to Probs. 11.19 and 11.31, but notice that this time the force is a speciﬁed function of x, not t. There are three regions to consider: (i) x < 0, (ii) 0 < x < L, (iii) x > L. Find the general solution for a(t), v(t),and x(t) in each region, exclude the runaway in region (iii), and impose the appropriate boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L.

In particular, if you choose L = v f τ/4, then vi = (4/3)v f , the initial kinetic energy is (8/9)U0, and the particle makes it through, even though it didn’t have sufﬁcient energy to get over the barrier!] Problem 11.33!

CHAPTER 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity 12.1 THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 12.1.1 Einstein’s Postulates Classical mechanics obeys the principle of relativity: the same laws apply in any inertial reference frame. By “inertial” I mean that the system is at rest or moving with constant velocity. 1 Imagine, for example, that you have loaded a billiard table onto a railroad car, and the train is going at constant speed down a smooth straight track. The game will proceed exactly the same as it would if the train were parked in the station; you don’t have to “correct” your shots for the fact that the train is moving—indeed, if you pulled all the curtains, you would have no way of knowing whether the train was moving or not. Notice by contrast that you know immediately if the train speeds up, or slows down, or rounds a corner, or goes over a bump—the billiard balls roll in weird curved trajectories, and you yourself feel a lurch and spill coffee on your shirt. The laws of mechanics, then, are certainly not the same in accelerating reference frames. In its application to classical mechanics, the principle of relativity is hardly new; it was stated clearly by Galileo. Question: does it also apply to the laws of electrodynamics? At ﬁrst glance, the answer would seem to be no. After all, a charge in motion produces a magnetic ﬁeld, whereas a charge at rest does not. A charge carried along by the train would generate a magnetic ﬁeld, but someone on the train, applying the laws of electrodynamics in that system, would predict no magnetic ﬁeld. In fact, many of the equations of electrodynamics, starting with the Lorentz force law, make explicit reference to “the” velocity of the charge. It certainly appears, therefore, that electromagnetic theory presupposes the exis- tence of a unique stationary reference frame, with respect to which all velocities are to be measured. And yet there is an extraordinary coincidence that gives us pause. Suppose we mount a wire loop on a freight car, and have the train pass between the poles of a 1This raises an awkward problem: If the laws of physics hold just as well in a uniformly moving frame, then we have no way of identifying the “rest” frame in the ﬁrst place, and hence no way of checking that some other frame is moving at constant velocity. To avoid this trap, we deﬁne an inertial frame formally as one in which Newton’s ﬁrst law holds. If you want to know whether you’re in an inertial frame, throw some rocks around—if they travel in straight lines at constant speed, you’ve got yourself an inertial frame, and any frame moving at constant velocity with respect to you will be another inertial frame (see Prob. 12.1). 502 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 503 Wire loop FIGURE 12.1 giant magnet (Fig. 12.1). As the loop rides through the magnetic ﬁeld, a motional emf is established; according to the ﬂux rule (Eq. 7.13), E =− d( dt . This emf, remember, is due to the magnetic force on charges in the wire loop, which are moving along with the train. On the other hand, if someone on the train naïvely applied the laws of electrodynamics in that system, what would the prediction be? No magnetic force, because the loop is at rest. But as the magnet ﬂies by, the magnetic ﬁeld in the freight car changes, and a changing magnetic ﬁeld induces an electric ﬁeld, by Faraday’s law. The resulting electric force would generate an emf in the loop given by Eq. 7.14: E =− d( dt . Because Faraday’s law and the ﬂux rule predict exactly the same emf, people on the train will get the right answer, even though their physical interpretation of the process is completely wrong! Or is it? Einstein could not believe this was a mere coincidence; he took it, rather, as a clue that electromagnetic phenomena, like mechanical ones, obey the principle of relativity. In his view, the analysis by the observer on the train is just as valid as that of the observer on the ground. If their interpretations differ (one calling the process electric, the other magnetic), so be it; their actual predictions are in agreement. Here’s what he wrote on the ﬁrst page of his 1905 paper intro- ducing the special theory of relativity: It is known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics—as usually understood at the present time—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observ- able phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction be- tween the two cases in which either one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises 504 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity in the neighborhood of the magnet an electric ﬁeld ...producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric ﬁeld arises in the neigh- borhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we ﬁnd an electromotive force ...which gives rise—assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed—to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case. Examples of this sort, together with unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relative to the “light medium,” suggest that the phe- nomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. 2 But I’m getting ahead of the story. To Einstein’s predecessors, the equality of the two emfs was just a lucky accident; they had no doubt that one observer was right and the other was wrong. They thought of electric and magnetic ﬁelds as strains in an invisible jellylike medium called ether, which permeated all of space. The speed of the charge was to be measured with respect to the ether—only then would the laws of electrodynamics be valid. The train observer is wrong, because that frame is moving relative to the ether. But wait a minute! How do we know the ground observer isn’t moving relative to the ether, too? After all, the earth rotates on its axis once a day and revolves around the sun once a year; the solar system circulates around the galaxy, and for all I know the galaxy itself is moving at a high speed through the cosmos. All told, we should be traveling at well over 50 km/s with respect to the ether. Like a mo- torcycle rider on the open road, we face an “ether wind” of high velocity—unless by some miraculous coincidence we just happen to ﬁnd ourselves in a tailwind of precisely the right strength, or the earth has some sort of “windshield” and drags its local supply of ether along with it. Suddenly it becomes a matter of crucial im- portance to ﬁnd the ether frame, experimentally, or else all our calculations will be invalid. The problem, then, is to determine our motion through the ether—to measure the speed and direction of the “ether wind.” How shall we do it? At ﬁrst glance you might suppose that practically any electromagnetic experiment would suf- ﬁce: If Maxwell’s equations are valid only with respect to the ether frame, any discrepancy between the experimental result and the theoretical prediction would be ascribable to the ether wind. Unfortunately, as nineteenth-century physicists soon realized, the anticipated error in a typical experiment is extremely small; as in the example above, “coincidences” always seem to conspire to hide the fact that we are using the “wrong” reference frame. So it takes an uncommonly delicate experiment to do the job. 2A translation of Einstein’s ﬁrst relativity paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” is reprinted in The Principle of Relativity, by H. A. Lorentz et al. (New York: Dover, 1923). 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 505 Now, among the results of classical electrodynamics is the prediction that elec- tromagnetic waves travel through the vacuum at a speed 1 √ϵ0μ0 = 3.00 × 10 8m/s, relative (presumably) to the ether. In principle, then, one should be able to detect the ether wind by simply measuring the speed of light in various directions. Like a motorboat on a river, the net speed “downstream” should be a maximum, for here the light is swept along by the ether; in the opposite direction, where it is bucking the current, the speed should be a minimum (Fig. 12.2). Ether wind Speed of light FIGURE 12.2 While the idea of this experiment could not be simpler, its execution is another matter, because light travels so inconveniently fast. If it weren’t for that “technical detail,” you could do it with a ﬂashlight and a stopwatch. As it happened, an elaborate and lovely experiment was devised by Michelson and Morley, using an optical interferometer of fantastic precision. I shall not go into the details here, because I do not want to distract your attention from the two essential points: (1) all Michelson and Morley were trying to do was compare the speed of light in different directions, and (2) what they in fact discovered was that this speed is exactly the same in all directions. Nowadays, when students are taught in high school to snicker at the naïveté of the ether model, it takes some imagination to comprehend how utterly perplexing this result must have been at the time. All other waves (water waves, sound waves, waves on a string) travel at a prescribed speed relative to the propagating medium (the stuff that does the waving), and if this medium is in motion with respect to the observer, the net speed is always greater “downstream” than “upstream.” Over the next 20 years, a series of improbable schemes were concocted in an effort to explain why this does not occur with light. Michelson and Morley themselves interpreted their experiment as conﬁrmation of the “ether drag” hypothesis, which held that the earth somehow pulls the ether along with it. But this was found to be inconsistent with other observations, notably the aberration of starlight.3 Various so-called “emission” theories were proposed, according to which the speed of electromagnetic waves is governed by the motion of the source—as it would be in 3A discussion of the Michelson-Morley experiment and related matters is to be found in R. Resnick’s Introduction to special relativity (New York: John Wiley, 1968), Chapter 1. 506 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity a corpuscular theory (conceiving of light as a stream of particles). Such theories called for implausible modiﬁcations in Maxwell’s equations, but in any event they were discredited by experiments using extraterrestrial light sources. Meanwhile, Fitzgerald and Lorentz suggested that the ether wind physically compresses all matter (including the Michelson-Morley apparatus itself) in just the right way to compensate for, and thereby conceal, the variation in speed with direction. As it turns out, there is a grain of truth in this, although their idea of the reason for the contraction was quite wrong. At any rate, it was not until Einstein that anyone took the Michelson-Morley result at face value, and suggested that the speed of light is a universal constant, the same in all directions, regardless of the motion of the observer or the source. There is no ether wind because there is no ether. Any inertial system is a suitable reference frame for the application of Maxwell’s equations, and the velocity of a charge is to be measured not with respect to a (nonexistent) absolute rest frame, nor with respect to a (nonexistent) ether, but simply with respect to the particular inertial system you happen to have chosen. Inspired, then, both by internal theoretical hints (the fact that the laws of elec- trodynamics are such as to give the right answer even when applied in the “wrong” system) and by external empirical evidence (the Michelson-Morley experiment4), Einstein proposed his two famous postulates: 1. The principle of relativity. The laws of physics apply in all inertial reference systems. 2. The universal speed of light. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the source. The special theory of relativity derives from these two postulates. The ﬁrst ele- vates Galileo’s observation about classical mechanics to the status of a general law, applying to all of physics. It states that there is no absolute rest system. The second might be considered Einstein’s response to the Michelson-Morley exper- iment. It means that there is no ether. (Some authors consider Einstein’s second postulate redundant—no more than a special case of the ﬁrst. They maintain that the very existence of ether would violate the principle of relativity, in the sense that it would deﬁne a unique stationary reference frame. I think this is nonsense. The existence of air as a medium for sound does not invalidate the theory of relativity. Ether is no more an absolute rest system than the water in a goldﬁsh bowl—which is a special system, if you happen to be the goldﬁsh, but scarcely “absolute.”)5 Unlike the principle of relativity, which had roots going back several cen- turies, the universal speed of light was radically new—and, on the face of it, 4Actually, Einstein appears to have been only dimly aware of the Michelson-Morley experiment at the time. For him, the theoretical argument was decisive. 5I put it this way in an effort to dispel some misunderstanding as to what constitutes an absolute rest frame. In 1977, it became possible to measure the speed of the earth through the 3 K background radiation left over from the “big bang.” Does this mean we have found an absolute rest system, and relativity is out the window? Of course not. 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 507 preposterous. For if I walk 5 mi/h down the corridor of a train going 60 mi/h, my net speed relative to the ground is “obviously” 65 mi/h—the speed of A (me) with respect to C (ground) is equal to the speed of A relative to B (train) plus the speed of B relative to C: vAC = vAB + vBC . (12.1) And yet, if A is a light signal (whether it comes from a ﬂashlight on the train or a lamp on the ground or a star in the sky) Einstein would have us believe that its speed is c relative to the train and c relative to the ground: vAC = vAB = c. (12.2) Clearly, Eq. 12.1, which we now call Galileo’s velocity addition rule (no one before Einstein would have bothered to give it a name at all) is incompatible with the second postulate. In special relativity, as we shall see, it is replaced by Einstein’s velocity addition rule: vAC = vAB + vBC 1 + (vABvBC /c2) . (12.3) For “ordinary” speeds (vAB ˙ c,vBC ˙ c), the denominator is so close to 1 that the discrepancy between Galileo’s formula and Einstein’s formula is negligible. On the other hand, Einstein’s formula has the desired property that if vAB = c, then automatically vAC = c: vAC = c + vBC 1 + (cvBC /c2) = c. But how can Galileo’s rule, which seems to rely on nothing but common sense, possibly be wrong? And if it is wrong, what does this do to all of classical physics? The answer is that special relativity compels us to alter our notions of space and time themselves, and therefore also of such derived quantities as velocity, mo- mentum, and energy. Although it developed historically out of Einstein’s contem- plation of electrodynamics, the special theory is not limited to any particular class of phenomena—rather, it is a description of the space-time “arena” in which all physical phenomena take place. And in spite of the reference to the speed of light in the second postulate, relativity has nothing to do with light: c is a fundamental velocity, and it happens that light travels at that speed, but it is perfectly possi- ble to conceive of a universe in which there are no electric charges, and hence no electromagnetic ﬁelds or waves, and yet relativity would still prevail. Because relativity deﬁnes the structure of space and time, it claims authority not merely over all presently known phenomena, but over those not yet discovered. It is, as Kant would say, a “prolegomenon to any future physics.” 508 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Problem 12.1 Let S be an inertial reference system. Use Galileo’s velocity addition rule. (a) Suppose that ¯S moves with constant velocity relative to S. Show that ¯S is also an inertial reference system. [Hint: Use the deﬁnition in footnote 1.] (b) Conversely, show that if ¯S is an inertial system, then it moves with respect to S at constant velocity. Problem 12.2 As an illustration of the principle of relativity in classical mechanics, consider the following generic collision: In inertial frame S, particle A (mass m A, velocity uA) hits particle B (mass m B, velocity uB). In the course of the collision some mass rubs off A and onto B, and we are left with particles C (mass mC , velocity uC )and D (mass m D, velocity uD). Assume that momentum (p ≡ mu)is conserved in S. (a) Prove that momentum is also conserved in inertial frame ¯S, which moves with velocity v relative to S. [Use Galileo’s velocity addition rule—this is an entirely classical calculation. What must you assume about mass?] (b) Suppose the collision is elastic in S; show that it is also elastic in ¯S. Problem 12.3 (a) What’s the percent error introduced when you use Galileo’s rule, instead of Einstein’s, with vAB = 5 mi/h and vBC = 60 mi/h? (b) Suppose you could run at half the speed of light down the corridor of a train going three-quarters the speed of light. What would your speed be relative to the ground? (c) Prove, using Eq. 12.3, that if vAB < c and vBC < c then vAC < c. Interpret this result. FIGURE 12.3 Problem 12.4 As the outlaws escape in their getaway car, which goes 3 4 c, the police ofﬁcer ﬁres a bullet from the pursuit car, which only goes 1 2 c (Fig. 12.3). The muzzle velocity of the bullet (relative to the gun) is 1 3 c. Does the bullet reach its target (a) according to Galileo, (b) according to Einstein? 12.1.2 The Geometry of Relativity In this section I present a series of gedanken (thought) experiments that serve to introduce the three most striking geometrical consequences of Einstein’s pos- tulates: time dilation, Lorentz contraction, and the relativity of simultaneity. In Sect. 12.1.3 the same results will be derived more systematically, using Lorentz transformations. 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 509 ( b) (a) FIGURE 12.4 ( b) (a) FIGURE 12.5 (i) The relativity of simultaneity. Imagine a freight car, traveling at constant speed along a smooth, straight track (Fig. 12.4). In the very center of the car there hangs a light bulb. When someone switches it on, the light spreads out in all directions at speed c. Because the lamp is equidistant from the two ends, an observer on the train will ﬁnd that the light reaches the front end at the same instant as it reaches the back end: The two events in question—(a) light reaches the front end (and maybe a buzzer goes off) and (b) light reaches the back end (another buzzer sounds)—occur simultaneously. However, to an observer on the ground these same two events are not simul- taneous. For as the light travels out from the bulb (going at speed c in both directions—that’s the second postulate), the train itself moves forward, so the beam going to the back end has a shorter distance to travel than the one going forward (Fig. 12.5). According to this observer, therefore, event (b) happens be- fore event (a). An observer passing by on an express train, meanwhile, would report that (a) preceded (b). Conclusion: Two events that are simultaneous in one inertial system are not, in general, simultaneous in another. Naturally, the train has to be going awfully fast before the discrepancy becomes detectable—that’s why you don’t notice it all the time. Of course, it’s always possible for a naïve witness to be mistaken about si- multaneity: a person sitting in the back corner of the car would hear buzzer b before buzzer a, simply because he’s closer to the source of the sound, and a child might infer that b actually rang before a. But this is a trivial error, having nothing to do with special relativity—obviously, you must correct for the time the signal (sound, light, carrier pigeon, or whatever) takes to reach you. When I speak of an observer, I mean someone with the sense to make this correction, and an obser- vation is what he records after doing so. What you hear or see, therefore, is not the same as what you observe. An observation is an artiﬁcial reconstruction after the fact, when all the data are in, and it doesn’t depend on where the observer is located. In fact, a wise observer will avoid the whole problem by stationing assistants at strategic locations, each equipped with a watch synchronized to a master clock, so that time measurements can be made right at the scene. I belabor this point in order to emphasize that the relativity of simultaneity is a genuine discrepancy between measurements made by competent observers in relative mo- tion, not a simple mistake arising from a failure to account for the travel time of light signals. 510 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Problem 12.5 Synchronized clocks are stationed at regular intervals, a million km apart, along a straight line. When the clock next to you reads 12 noon: (a) What time do you see on the 90th clock down the line? (b) What time do you observe on that clock? Problem 12.6 Every 2 years, more or less, The New York Times publishes an article in which some astronomer claims to have found an object traveling faster than the speed of light. Many of these reports result from a failure to distinguish what is seen from what is observed—that is, from a failure to account for light travel time. Here’s an example: A star is traveling with speed v at an angle θ to the line of sight (Fig. 12.6). What is its apparent speed across the sky? (Suppose the light signal from b reaches the earth at a time .t after the signal from a, and the star has meanwhile advanced a distance .s across the celestial sphere; by “apparent speed,” I mean .s/.t.) What angle θ gives the maximum apparent speed? Show that the apparent speed can be much greater than c,evenif v itself is less than c. θ Δ s To earth b a v FIGURE 12.6 (ii) Time dilation. Now let’s consider a light ray that leaves the bulb and strikes the ﬂoor of the car directly below. Question: How long does it take the light to make this trip? From the point of view of an observer on the train, the answer is easy: If the height of the car is h, the time is .¯t = h c . (12.4) vΔt h FIGURE 12.7 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 511 (I’ll use an overbar to denote measurements made on the train.) On the other hand, as observed from the ground, this same ray must travel farther, because the train itself is moving. From Fig. 12.7, I see that this distance is √h2 + (v.t)2,so .t = √h2 + (v.t)2 c . Solving for .t,wehave .t = h c 1 √ 1 − v2/c2 , and therefore .¯t = √ 1 − v2/c2 .t. (12.5) Evidently the time elapsed between the same two events—(a) light leaves bulb, and (b) light strikes center of ﬂoor—is different for the two observers. In fact, the interval recorded on the train clock, .¯t,is shorter by the factor γ ≡ 1 √1 − v2/c2 . (12.6) Conclusion: Moving clocks run slow. This is called time dilation. It doesn’t have anything to do with the mechanics of clocks; it’s a statement about the nature of time, which applies to all properly functioning timepieces. Of all Einstein’s predictions, none has received more spectacular and persua- sive conﬁrmation than time dilation. Most elementary particles are unstable: they disintegrate after a characteristic lifetime 6 that varies from one species to the next. The lifetime of a neutron is 15 min; of a muon, 2 × 10 −6 s; and of a neutral pion, 9 × 10 −17 s. But these are lifetimes of particles at rest. When particles are mov- ing at speeds close to c they last much longer, for their internal clocks (whatever it is that tells them when their time is up) are running slow, in accordance with Einstein’s time dilation formula. Example 12.1. A muon is traveling through the laboratory at three-ﬁfths the speed of light. How long does it last? 6Actually, an individual particle may last longer or shorter than this. Particle disintegration is a random process, and I should really speak of the average lifetime for the species. But to avoid irrelevant complication, I shall pretend that every particle disintegrates after precisely the average lifetime. 512 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Solution In this case, γ = 1 √1 − (3/5)2 = 5 4 , so it lives longer (than at rest) by a factor of 5 4 : 5 4 × (2 × 10 −6) s = 2.5 × 10 −6 s. It may strike you that time dilation is inconsistent with the principle of relativ- ity. For if the ground observer says the train clock runs slow, the train observer can with equal justice claim that the ground clock runs slow—after all, from the train’s point of view it is the ground that is in motion. Who’s right? Answer: They’re both right! On closer inspection, the “contradiction,” which seems so stark, evaporates. Let me explain: In order to check the rate of the train clock, the ground observer uses two of his own clocks (Fig. 12.8): one to compare times at the beginning of the interval, when the train clock passes point A, the other to compare times at the end of the interval, when the train clock passes point B. Of course, he must be careful to synchronize his clocks before the experiment. What he ﬁnds is that while the train clock ticked off, say, 3 minutes, the interval between his own two clock readings was 5 minutes. He concludes that the train clock runs slow. Meanwhile, the observer on the train is checking the rate of the ground clock by the same procedure: She uses two carefully synchronized train clocks, and compares times with a single ground clock as it passes by each of them in turn (Fig. 12.9). She ﬁnds that while the ground clock ticks off 3 minutes, the interval between her train clocks is 5 minutes, and concludes that the ground clock runs slow. Is there a contradiction? No, for the two observers have measured different things. The ground observer compared one train clock with two ground clocks; the train observer compared one ground clock with two train clocks. Each fol- lowed a sensible and correct procedure, comparing a single moving clock with two stationary ones. “So what,” you say, “the stationary clocks were synchro- nized in each instance, so it cannot matter that they used two different ones.” But there’s the rub: Clocks that are properly synchronized in one system will not Train clock Ground clock A Ground clock B BA FIGURE 12.8 Train clock B Ground clock Train clock A FIGURE 12.9 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 513 be synchronized when observed from another system. They can’t be, for to say that two clocks are synchronized is to say that they read 12 noon simultaneously, and we have already learned that what’s simultaneous to one observer is not si- multaneous to another. So whereas each observer conducted a perfectly sound measurement, from his/her own point of view, the other observer (watching the process) considers that she/he made the most elementary blunder in the book, by using two unsynchronized clocks. That’s how, in spite of the fact that his clocks “actually” run slow, he manages to conclude that hers are running slow (and vice versa). Because moving clocks are not synchronized, it is essential when checking time dilation to focus attention on a single moving clock. All moving clocks run slow by the same factor, but you can’t start timing on one clock and then switch to another because they weren’t in step to begin with. But you can use as many stationary clocks (stationary with respect to you, the observer) as you please, for they are properly synchronized (moving observers would dispute this, but that’s their problem). Example 12.2. The twin paradox. On her 21st birthday, an astronaut takes off in a rocket ship at a speed of 12 13 c. After 5 years have elapsed on her watch, she turns around and heads back at the same speed to rejoin her twin brother, who stayed at home. Question: How old is each twin at their reunion? Solution The traveling twin has aged 10 years (5 years out, 5 years back); she arrives at home just in time to celebrate her 31st birthday. However, as viewed from earth, the moving clock has been running slow by a factor γ = 1 √1 − (12/13)2 = 13 5 . The time elapsed on earthbound clocks is 13 5 × 10 = 26, and her brother will be therefore celebrating his 47th birthday—he is now 16 years older than his twin sis- ter! But don’t be deceived: This is no fountain of youth for the traveling twin, for though she may die later than her brother, she will not have lived any more—she’s just done it slower. During the ﬂight, all her biological processes—metabolism, pulse, thought, and speech—are subject to the same time dilation that affects her watch. The so-called twin paradox arises when you try to tell this story from the point of view of the traveling twin. She sees the earth ﬂy off at 12 13 c, turn around after 5 years, and return. From her point of view, it would seem, she’s at rest, whereas her brother is in motion, and hence it is he who should be younger at the reunion. An enormous amount has been written about the twin paradox, but the truth is there’s really no paradox here at all: this second analysis is simply wrong. The two twins are not equivalent. The traveling twin experiences acceleration when she turns around to head home, but her brother does not. To put it in fancier language, the traveling twin is not in an inertial system—more precisely, she’s 514 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity in one inertial system on the way out and a completely different inertial system on the way back. You’ll see in Prob. 12.16 how to analyze this problem correctly from her perspective, but as far as the resolution of the “paradox” is concerned, it is enough to note that the traveling twin cannot claim to be a stationary observer because you can’t undergo acceleration and remain stationary. Problem 12.7 In a laboratory experiment, a muon is observed to travel 800 m before disintegrating. A graduate student looks up the lifetime of a muon (2 × 10−6 s) and concludes that its speed was v = 800 m 2 × 10−6 s = 4 × 108 m/s. Faster than light! Identify the student’s error, and ﬁnd the actual speed of this muon. Problem 12.8 A rocket ship leaves earth at a speed of 3 5 c. When a clock on the rocket says 1 hour has elapsed, the rocket ship sends a light signal back to earth. (a) According to earth clocks, when was the signal sent? (b) According to earth clocks, how long after the rocket left did the signal arrive back on earth? (c) According to the rocket observer, how long after the rocket left did the signal arrive back on earth? (iii) Lorentz contraction. For the third gedanken experiment you must imag- ine that we have set up a lamp at one end of a boxcar and a mirror at the other, so that a light signal can be sent down and back (Fig. 12.10). Question: How long does the signal take to complete the round trip? To an observer on the train, the answer is .¯t = 2 . ¯x c , (12.7) where . ¯x is the length of the car (the overbar, as before, denotes measurements made on the train). To an observer on the ground, the process is more complicated because of the motion of the train. If .t1 is the time for the light signal to reach the front end, and .t2 is the return time, then (see Fig. 12.11): .t1 = .x + v.t1 c ,.t2 = .x − v.t2 c , Lamp Mirror v FIGURE 12.10 vΔt1 v vΔt2 FIGURE 12.11 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 515 or, solving for .t1 and .t2: .t1 = .x c − v ,.t2 = .x c + v . So the round-trip time is .t = .t1 + .t2 = 2 .x c 1 (1 − v2/c2) . (12.8) But these intervals are related by the time dilation formula, Eq. 12.5: .¯t = √1 − v2/c2 .t. Applying this to Eqs. 12.7 and 12.8, I conclude that . ¯x = 1 √1 − v2/c2 .x. (12.9) The length of the boxcar is not the same when measured by an observer on the ground, as it is when measured by an observer on the train—from the ground point of view, it is somewhat shorter. Conclusion: Moving objects are shortened. We call this Lorentz contraction. Notice that the same factor, γ ≡ 1 √1 − v2/c2 , appears in both the time dilation formula and the Lorentz contraction formula. This makes it all very easy to remember: Moving clocks run slow, moving sticks are shortened, and the factor is always γ . Of course, the observer on the train doesn’t think her car is shortened—her meter sticks are contracted by that same factor, so all her measurements come out the same as when the train was standing in the station. In fact, from her point of view it is objects on the ground that are shortened. This raises again a paradoxical problem: If A says B’s sticks are short, and B says A’s sticks are short, who is right? Answer: They both are! But to reconcile the rival claims we must study carefully the actual process by which length is measured. Suppose you want to ﬁnd the length of a board. If it’s at rest (with respect to you) you simply lay your ruler down next to the board, record the readings at each end, and subtract (Fig. 12.12). (If you’re really clever, you’ll line up the left end of the ruler against the left end of the board—then you only have to read one number.) But what if the board is moving? Same story, only this time, of course, you must be careful to read the two ends at the same instant of time. If you don’t, the 516 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Board Ruler FIGURE 12.12 board will move in the course of measurement, and obviously you’ll get the wrong answer. But therein lies the problem: Because of the relativity of simultaneity the two observers disagree on what constitutes “the same instant of time.” When the person on the ground measures the length of the boxcar, he reads the position of the two ends at the same instant in his system. But the person on the train, watch- ing him do it, complains that he read the front end ﬁrst, then waited a moment before reading the back end. Naturally, he came out short, in spite of the fact that (to her) he was using an undersized meter stick, which would otherwise have yielded a number too large. Both observers measure lengths correctly (from the point of view of their respective inertial frames), and each ﬁnds the other’s sticks to be shortened. Yet there is no inconsistency, for they are measuring different things, and each considers the other’s method improper. Example 12.3. The barn and ladder paradox. Unlike time dilation, there is no direct experimental conﬁrmation of Lorentz contraction, simply because it’s too difﬁcult to get an object of measurable size going anywhere near the speed of light. The following parable illustrates how bizarre the world would be if the speed of light were more accessible. There once was a farmer who had a ladder too long to store in his barn (Fig. 12.13a). He chanced one day to read some relativity, and a solution to his problem suggested itself. He instructed his daughter to run with the ladder as fast as she could—the moving ladder having Lorentz-contracted to a size the barn could easily accommodate, she was to rush through the door, whereupon the (a) (c) (b) FIGURE 12.13 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 517 farmer would slam it behind her, capturing the ladder inside (Fig. 12.13b). The daughter, however, has read somewhat farther in the relativity book; she points out that in her reference frame the barn, not the ladder, will contract, and the ﬁt will be even worse than it was with the two at rest (Fig. 12.13c). Question: Who’s right? Will the ladder ﬁt inside the barn, or won’t it? Solution They’re both right! When you say “the ladder is in the barn,” you mean that all parts of it are inside at one instant of time, but in view of the relativity of si- multaneity, that’s a condition that depends on the observer. There are really two relevant events here: a. Back end of ladder makes it in the door. b. Front end of ladder hits far wall of barn. The farmer says a occurs before b, so there is a time when the ladder is entirely within the barn; his daughter says b precedes a, so there is not. Contradiction? Nope—just a difference in perspective. “But come now,” I hear you protest, “when it’s all over and the dust clears, either the ladder is inside the barn, or it isn’t. There can be no dispute about that.” Quite so, but now you’re introducing a new element into the story: What happens as the ladder is brought to a stop? Suppose the farmer grabs the last rung of the ladder ﬁrmly with one hand, while he slams the door with the other. Assuming it remains intact, the ladder must now stretch out to its rest length. Evidently, the front end keeps going, even after the rear end has stopped! Expanding like an accordian, the front end of the ladder smashes into the far side of the barn. In truth, the whole notion of a “rigid” object loses its meaning in relativity, for when it changes its speed, different parts do not in general accelerate simultaneously— in this way, the material stretches or shrinks to reach the length appropriate to its new velocity.7 But to return to the question at hand: When the ladder ﬁnally comes to a stop, is it inside the barn or not? The answer is indeterminate. When the front end of the ladder hits the far side of the barn, something has to give, and the farmer is left either with a broken ladder inside the barn or with the ladder intact poking through a hole in the wall. In any event, he is unlikely to be pleased with the outcome. One ﬁnal comment on Lorentz contraction. A moving object is shortened only along the direction of its motion: Dimensions perpendicular to the velocity are not contracted. Indeed, in deriving the time dilation formula I took it for granted that the height of the train is the same for both observers. I’ll now justify this, using a lovely gedanken experiment suggested by Taylor and Wheeler.8 Imagine that we build 7For a related paradox see E. Pierce, Am.J.Phys. 75, 610 (2007). 8E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, Spacetime Physics 2nd ed. (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1992). A somewhat different version of the same argument is given in J. H. Smith, Introduction to special relativity (Champaign, IL: Stipes, 1965). 518 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity a wall beside the railroad tracks, and 1 m above the rails (as measured on the ground), we paint a horizontal blue line. When the train goes by, a passenger leans out the window holding a wet paintbrush 1 m above the rails, as measured on the train, leaving a horizontal red line on the wall. Question: Does the passenger’s red line lie above or below our blue one? If the rule were that perpendicular directions contract, then the person on the ground would predict that the red line is lower, while the person on the train would say it’s the blue one (to the latter, of course, the ground is moving). The principle of relativity says that both observers are equally justiﬁed, but they cannot both be right. No subtleties of simultaneity or synchronization can rationalize this contradiction; either the blue line is higher or the red one is—unless they exactly coincide, which is the inescapable conclusion. There cannot be a law of contraction (or expansion) of perpendicular dimensions, for it would lead to irreconcilably inconsistent predictions. Problem 12.9 A Lincoln Continental is twice as long as a VW Beetle, when they are at rest. As the Continental overtakes the VW, going through a speed trap, a (stationary) policeman observes that they both have the same length. The VW is going at half the speed of light. How fast is the Lincoln going? (Leave your answer as a multiple of c.) Problem 12.10 A sailboat is manufactured so that the mast leans at an angle ¯θ with respect to the deck. An observer standing on a dock sees the boat go by at speed v (Fig. 12.14). What angle does this observer say the mast makes? v θ FIGURE 12.14 R ω FIGURE 12.15 Problem 12.11 A record turntable of radius R rotates at angular velocity ω! (Fig. 12.15). The circumference is presumably Lorentz-contracted, but the radius (being perpendicular to the velocity) is not. What’s the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, in terms of ω and R? According to the rules of ordinary geometry, it has to be π . What’s going on here? 9 9This is known as Ehrenfest’s paradox; for discussion and references, see H.

An “event” is something that takes place at a speciﬁc location (x, y, z), at a precise time (t). The explosion of a ﬁrecracker, for example, is an event; a tour of Europe is not. Suppose we know the coordinates (x, y, z, t) of a particular event E in one inertial system S, and we would like to calculate the coordinates ( ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯t) of that same event in some other inertial system ¯S. What we need is a “dictionary” for translating from the language of S to the language of ¯S. We may as well orient our axes as shown in Fig. 12.16, so that ¯S slides along the x axis at speed v. If we “start the clock” (t = 0) at the moment the origins (O and ¯O) coincide, then at time t, ¯O will be a distance vt from O, and hence x = d + vt, (12.10) where d is the distance from ¯O to ¯A at time t ( ¯A is the point on the ¯x axis that is even with E when the event occurs). Before Einstein, anyone would have said immediately that d =¯x, (12.11) and thus constructed the “dictionary” (i) ¯x = x − vt, (ii) ¯y = y, (iii) ¯z = z, (iv) ¯t = t. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (12.12) These are now called the Galilean transformations, though they scarcely deserve so ﬁne a title—the last one, in particular, went without saying, since everyone as- sumed the ﬂow of time is the same for all observers. In the context of special x y x x dvt y E v z AO z O FIGURE 12.16 520 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity relativity, however, we must expect (iv) to be replaced by a rule that incorporates time dilation, the relativity of simultaneity, and the nonsynchronization of moving clocks. Likewise, there will be a modiﬁcation in (i) to account for Lorentz con- traction. As for (ii) and (iii), they, at least, remain unchanged, for we have already seen that there can be no modiﬁcation of lengths perpendicular to the motion. But where does the classical derivation of (i) break down? Answer: In Eq. 12.11. For d is the distance from ¯O to ¯A as measured in S, whereas ¯x is the distance from ¯O to ¯A as measured in ¯S. Because ¯O and ¯A are at rest in ¯S, ¯x is the “moving stick,” which appears contracted to S: d = 1 γ ¯x. (12.13) When this is inserted in Eq. 12.10 we obtain the relativistic version of (i): ¯x = γ(x − vt). (12.14) Of course, we could have run the same argument from the point of view of ¯S. The diagram (Fig. 12.17) looks similar, but in this case it depicts the scene at time ¯t, whereas Fig. 12.16 showed the scene at time t. (Note that t and ¯t represent the same physical instant at E, but not elsewhere, because of the relativity of simultaneity.) If we assume that ¯S also starts its clock when the origins coincide, then at time ¯t, O will be a distance v ¯t from ¯O, and therefore ¯x = ¯d − v ¯t, (12.15) where ¯d is the distance from O to A at time ¯t, and A is that point on the x axis that is even with E when the event occurs. The classical physicist would have said that x = ¯d, and, using (iv), recovered (i). But, as before, relativity demands that we observe a subtle distinction: x is the distance from O to Ain S, whereas ¯d is the distance from O to Ain ¯S. Because O and A are at rest in S, x is the “moving stick,” and ¯d = 1 γ x. (12.16) x d x y x vt y E v z A z O O FIGURE 12.17 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 521 It follows that x = γ( ¯x + v ¯t). (12.17) This last equation comes as no surprise, for the symmetry of the situation dic- tates that the formula for x, in terms of ¯x and ¯t, should be identical to the formula for ¯x in terms of x and t (Eq. 12.14), except for a switch in the sign of v.(If ¯S is going to the right at speed v, with respect to S, then S is going to the left at speed v, with respect to ¯S.) Nevertheless, this is a useful result, for if we substitute ¯x from Eq. 12.14, and solve for ¯t, we complete the relativistic “dictionary”: (i) ¯x = γ(x − vt), (ii) ¯y = y, (iii) ¯z = z, (iv) ¯t = γ (t − v c2 x) . (12.18) These are the famous Lorentz transformations, with which Einstein replaced the Galilean ones. They contain all the geometrical information in the special theory, as the following examples illustrate. The reverse dictionary, which carries you from ¯S back to S, can be obtained algebraically by solving (i) and (iv) for x and t, or, more simply, by switching the sign of v: (i[) x = γ( ¯x + v ¯t), (ii[) y =¯y, (iii [) z =¯z, (iv[) t = γ (¯t + v c2 ¯x) . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (12.19) Example 12.4. Simultaneity, synchronization, and time dilation. Suppose event A occurs at x A = 0, tA = 0, and event B occurs at x B = b, tB = 0. The two events are simultaneous in S (they both take place at t = 0). But they are not simultaneous in ¯S, for the Lorentz transformations give ¯x A = 0, ¯tA = 0 and ¯x B = γ b, ¯tB =−γ(v/c2)b. According to the ¯S clocks, then, B occurred before A. This is nothing new, of course—just the relativity of simultaneity. But I wanted you to see how it follows from the Lorentz transformations. Suppose that at time t = 0 observer S decides to examine all the clocks in ¯S. He ﬁnds that they read different times, depending on their location; from (iv): ¯t =−γ v c2 x. 522 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity x = 0 x = 0 clocks clocks v S S FIGURE 12.18 Those to the left of the origin (negative x)are ahead, and those to the right are behind, by an amount that increases in proportion to their distance (Fig. 12.18). Only the master clock at the origin reads ¯t = 0. Thus, the nonsynchronization of moving clocks, too, follows directly from the Lorentz transformations. Of course, from the ¯S viewpoint it is the S clocks that are out of synchronization, as you can check by putting ¯t = 0 into equation (iv [). Finally, suppose S focuses his attention on a single clock at rest in the ¯S frame (say, the one at ¯x = a), and watches it over some interval .t. How much time elapses on the moving clock? Because ¯x is ﬁxed, (iv [)gives .t = γ.¯t,or .¯t = 1 γ .t. That’s the old time dilation formula, derived now from the Lorentz transforma- tions. Please note that it’s ¯x we hold ﬁxed, here, because we’re watching one moving clock. If you hold x ﬁxed, then you’re watching a whole series of differ- ent ¯S clocks as they pass by, and that won’t tell you whether any one of them is running slow. Example 12.5. Lorentz contraction. Imagine a stick at rest in ¯S (hence moving to the right at speed v in S). Its rest length (that is, its length as measured in ¯S)is . ¯x =¯xr −¯xl, where the subscripts denote the right and left ends of the stick. If an observer in S were to measure the stick, he would subtract the positions of the two ends at one instant of his time t: .x = xr − xl (for tl = tr ). According to (i), then, .x = 1 γ . ¯x. This is the old Lorentz contraction formula. Note that it’s t we hold ﬁxed, here, because we’re talking about a measurement made by S, and he marks off the two ends at the same instant of his time. ( ¯S doesn’t have to be so fussy, since the stick is at rest in her frame.) 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 523 Example 12.6. Einstein’s velocity addition rule. Suppose a particle moves a distance dx (in S) in a time dt. Its velocity u is then u = dx dt . In ¯S, meanwhile, it has moved a distance d ¯x = γ(dx − vdt), as we see from (i), in a time given by (iv): d ¯t = γ ( dt − v c2 dx) . The velocity in ¯S is therefore ¯u = d ¯x d ¯t = γ(dx − vdt) γ ( dt − v/c2dx) = (dx/dt − v) 1 − v/c2dx/dt = u − v 1 − uv/c2 . (12.20) This is Einstein’s velocity addition rule. To recover the more transparent nota- tion of Eq. 12.3, let A be the particle, B be S, and C be ¯S; then u = vAB, ¯u = vAC , and v = vCB =−vBC , so Eq. 12.20 becomes vAC = vAB + vBC 1 + (vABvBC /c2) . Problem 12.12 Solve Eqs. 12.18 for x, y, z, t in terms of ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯t, and check that you recover Eqs. 12.19. Problem 12.13 Sophie Zabar, clairvoyante, cried out in pain at precisely the instant her twin brother, 500 km away, hit his thumb with a hammer. A skeptical scientist observed both events (brother’s accident, Sophie’s cry) from an airplane traveling at 12 13 c to the right (Fig. 12.19). Which event occurred ﬁrst, according to the scientist? How much earlier was it, in seconds? Problem 12.14 (a) In Ex. 12.6 we found how velocities in the x direction transform when you go from S to ¯S. Derive the analogous formulas for velocities in the y and z directions. (b) A spotlight is mounted on a boat so that its beam makes an angle ¯θ with the deck (Fig. 12.20). If this boat is then set in motion at speed v, what angle θ does an individual photon trajectory make with the deck, according to an observer on the dock? What angle does the beam (illuminated, say, by a light fog) make?

On their 21st birthday, one twin gets! on a moving sidewalk, which carries her out to star X at speed 4 5 c; her twin brother stays home. When the traveling twin gets to star X, she immediately jumps onto the returning moving sidewalk and comes back to earth, again at speed 4 5 c. She arrives on her 39th birthday (as determined by her watch). (a) How old is her twin brother? (b) How far away is star X? (Give your answer in light years.) Call the outbound sidewalk system ¯S and the inbound one ˜S (the earth system is S). All three systems choose their coordinates and set their master clocks such that x =¯x =˜x = 0, t = ¯t = ˜t = 0 at the moment of departure. (c) What are the coordinates (x, t) of the jump (from outbound to inbound side- walk) in S? (d) What are the coordinates ( ¯x, ¯t) of the jump in ¯S? (e) What are the coordinates ( ˜x, ˜t) of the jump in ˜S? (f) If the traveling twin wants her watch to agree with the clock in ˜S, how must she reset it immediately after the jump? What does her watch then read when she gets home? (This wouldn’t change her age, of course—she’s still 39—it would just make her watch agree with the standard synchronization in ˜S.) (g) If the traveling twin is asked the question, “How old is your brother right now?”, what is the correct reply (i) just before she makes the jump, (ii) just after she 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 525 makes the jump? (Nothing dramatic happens to her brother during the split second between (i) and (ii), of course; what does change abruptly is his sister’s notion of what “right now, back home” means.) (h) How many earth years does the return trip take? Add this to (ii) from (g) to determine how old she expects him to be at their reunion. Compare your answer to (a). 12.1.4 The Structure of Spacetime (i) Four-vectors. The Lorentz transformations take on a simpler appearance when expressed in terms of the quantities x 0 ≡ ct,β ≡ v c . (12.21) Using x 0 (instead of t) and β (instead of v) amounts to changing the unit of time from the second to the meter—1 meter of x 0 corresponds to the time it takes light to travel 1 meter (in vacuum). If, at the same time, we number the x, y, z coordinates, so that x 1 = x, x 2 = y, x 3 = z, (12.22) then the Lorentz transformations read ¯x 0 = γ(x 0 − βx 1), ¯x 1 = γ(x 1 − βx 0), ¯x 2 = x 2, ¯x 3 = x 3. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (12.23) Or,inmatrixform: ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ¯x 0 ¯x 1 ¯x 2 ¯x 3 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ γ −γβ 00 −γβ γ 00 00 1 0 00 0 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ . (12.24) Letting Greek indices run from 0 to 3, this can be distilled into a single equa- tion: ¯x μ = 3∑ ν=0(\u000b μ ν )x ν, (12.25) 526 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity where \u000b is the Lorentz transformation matrix in Eq. 12.24 (the superscript μ labels the row, the subscript ν labels the column). One virtue of writing things in this abstract manner is that we can handle in the same format a more general transformation, in which the relative motion is not along a common x ¯x axis; the matrix \u000b would be more complicated, but the structure of Eq. 12.25 is unchanged. If this reminds you of the rotations we studied in Sect. 1.1.5, it’s no accident. There we were concerned with the change in components when you switch to a rotated coordinate system; here we are interested in the change of components when you go to a moving system. In Chapter 1 we deﬁned a (3-)vector as any set of three components that transform under rotations the same way (x, y, z) do; by extension, we now deﬁne a 4-vector as any set of four components that transform in the same manner as (x 0, x 1, x 2, x 3) under Lorentz transformations: ¯aμ = 3∑ ν=0 \u000b μ ν aν. (12.26) For the particular case of a transformation along the x axis, ¯a0 = γ(a0 − βa1), ¯a1 = γ(a1 − βa0), ¯a2 = a2, ¯a3 = a3. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (12.27) There is a 4-vector analog to the dot product (A · B ≡ Ax Bx + Ay By + Az Bz), but it’s not just the sum of the products of like components; rather, the zeroth components have a minus sign: −a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3. (12.28) This is the four-dimensional scalar product; you should check for yourself (Prob. 12.17) that it has the same value in all inertial systems: −¯a0 ¯b0 +¯a1 ¯b1 +¯a2 ¯b2 +¯a3 ¯b3 =−a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3; (12.29) just as the ordinary dot product is invariant (unchanged) under rotations, this combination is invariant under Lorentz transformations. To keep track of the minus sign, it is convenient to introduce the covariant vector aμ, which differs from the contravariant aμ only in the sign of the zeroth component: aμ = (a0, a1, a2, a3) ≡ (−a0, a1, a2, a3). (12.30) You must be scrupulously careful about the placement of indices in this business: upper indices designate contravariant vectors; lower indices are for covariant 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 527 vectors. Raising or lowering the temporal index costs a minus sign (a0 =−a0); raising or lowering a spatial index changes nothing (a1 = a1, a2 = a2, a3 = a3). Formally, aμ = 3∑ ν=0 gμνaν, where gμν ≡ ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ −1000 0100 0010 0001 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (12.31) is the (Minkowski) metric.10 The scalar product can now be written with the summation symbol, 3∑ μ=0 aμbμ, or, more compactly still, aμbμ. (12.32) (Summation is implied whenever a Greek index is repeated in a product—once as a covariant index and once as contravariant. This is called the Einstein summa- tion convention, after its inventor, who regarded it as one of his most important contributions.) Of course, we could just as well take care of the minus sign by switching to covariant b: aμbμ = aμbμ =−a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3. (12.33) Problem 12.17 Check Eq. 12.29, using Eq. 12.27. [This only proves the invariance• of the scalar product for transformations along the x direction. But the scalar product is also invariant under rotations, since the ﬁrst term is not affected at all, and the last three constitute the three-dimensional dot product a · b. By a suitable rotation, the x direction can be aimed any way you please, so the four-dimensional scalar product is actually invariant under arbitrary Lorentz transformations.] Problem 12.18 (a) Write out the matrix that describes a Galilean transformation (Eq. 12.12). (b) Write out the matrix describing a Lorentz transformation along the y axis. (c) Find the matrix describing a Lorentz transformation with velocity v along the x axis followed by a Lorentz transformation with velocity ¯v along the y axis. Does it matter in what order the transformations are carried out? 10It doesn’t matter whether you deﬁne the scalar product as in Eq. 12.28 (−a0b0 + a · b) or with an overall minus sign (a0b0 − a · b); if one is invariant, so is the other. In the literature, both conventions are common, and you just have to be aware of which one is in use. If they write the diagonal compo- nents of the Minkowski metric as (−, +, +, +), they are using the convention in Eq. 12.28; otherwise they will write (+, −, −, −). 528 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Problem 12.19 The parallel between rotations and Lorentz transformations is even more striking if we introduce the rapidity: θ ≡ tanh −1(v/c). (12.34) (a) Express the Lorentz transformation matrix \u000b (Eq. 12.24) in terms of θ ,and compare it to the rotation matrix (Eq. 1.29). In some respects, rapidity is a more natural way to describe motion than ve- locity.11 For one thing, it ranges from −∞ to +∞, instead of −c to +c.More signiﬁcantly, rapidities add, whereas velocities do not. (b) Express the Einstein velocity addition law in terms of rapidity. (ii) The invariant interval. The scalar product of a 4-vector with itself, aμaμ =−(a0)2 + (a1)2 + (a2)2 + (a3)2, can be positive (if the “spatial” terms dominate) or negative (if the “temporal” term dominates) or zero: If aμaμ > 0, aμ is called spacelike. If aμaμ < 0, aμ is called timelike. If aμaμ = 0, aμ is called lightlike. Suppose event A occurs at (x 0 A, x 1 A, x 2 A, x 3 A), and event B at (x 0 B, x 1 B, x 2 B, x 3 B). The difference, .x μ ≡ x μ A − x μ B , (12.35) is the displacement 4-vector. The scalar product of .x μ with itself is called the invariant interval between two events: I ≡ (.x) μ(.x)μ =−(.x 0)2 + (.x 1)2 + (.x 2)2 + (.x 3)2 =−c2t 2 + d 2, (12.36) where t is the time difference between the two events and d is their spatial sep- aration. When you transform to a moving system, the time between A and B is altered (¯t ̸= t), and so is the spatial separation ( ¯d ̸= d), but the interval I remains the same. If the displacement between two events is timelike (I < 0), there exists an inertial system (accessible by Lorentz transformation) in which they occur at the same point. For if I hop on a train going from (A)to(B) at the speed v = d/t, leaving event A when it occurs, I shall be just in time to pass B when it occurs; in the train system, A and B take place at the same point. You cannot do this for a spacelike interval, of course, because v would have to be greater than c, and no observer can exceed the speed of light (γ would be imaginary and the Lorentz transformations would be nonsense). On the other hand, if the displacement is spacelike (I > 0), then there exists a system in which the two events occur at the same time (see Prob. 12.21). And if the displacement is lightlike (I = 0), then the two events could be connected by a light signal. 11E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, Spacetime Physics, 1st ed. (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1966). 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 529 Problem 12.20 (a) Event A happens at point (x A = 5, yA = 3, z A = 0) and at time tA given by ctA = 15; event B occurs at (10, 8, 0) and ctB = 5, both in system S. (i) What is the invariant interval between A and B? (ii) Is there an inertial system in which they occur simultaneously?Ifso, ﬁnd its velocity (magnitude and direction) relative to S. (iii) Is there an inertial system in which they occur at the same point? If so, ﬁnd its velocity relative to S. (b) Repeat part (a) for A = (2, 0, 0), ct = 1; and B = (5, 0, 0), ct = 3. Problem 12.21 The coordinates of event A are (x A, 0, 0), tA, and the coordinates of event B are (x B, 0, 0), tB. Assuming the displacement between them is spacelike, ﬁnd the velocity of the system in which they are simultaneous. (iii) Space-time diagrams. If you want to represent the motion of a particle graphically, the normal practice is to plot the position versus time (that is, x runs vertically and t horizontally). On such a graph, the velocity can be read off as the slope of the curve. For some reason, the convention is reversed in relativity: every- one plots position horizontally and time (or, better, x 0 = ct) vertically. Velocity is then given by the reciprocal of the slope. A particle at rest is represented by a vertical line; a photon, traveling at the speed of light, is described by a 45◦ line; and a rocket going at some intermediate speed follows a line of slope c/v = 1/β (Fig. 12.21). We call such plots Minkowski diagrams. The trajectory of a particle on a Minkowski diagram is called a world line. Suppose you set out from the origin at time t = 0. Because no material object can travel faster than light, your world line can never have a slope less than 1. Accordingly, your motion is restricted to the wedge-shaped region bounded by the two 45 ◦ lines (Fig. 12.22). We call this your “future,” in the sense that it is the Particle at rest PhotonRocket ct x FIGURE 12.21 Your future at t Your future, at t = 0 Your past, at t = 0 Present Present Your world line FIGURE 12.22 530 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity locus of all points accessible to you. Of course, as time goes on, and you move along your chosen world line, your options progressively narrow: your “future” at any moment is the forward “wedge” constructed at whatever point you ﬁnd yourself. Meanwhile, the backward wedge represents your “past,” in the sense that it is the locus of all points from which you might have come. As for the rest (the region outside the forward and backward wedges), this is the generalized “present.” You can’t get there, and you didn’t come from there. In fact, there’s no way you can inﬂuence any event in the present (the message would have to travel faster than light); it’s a vast expanse of spacetime that is absolutely inaccessible to you. I’ve been ignoring the y and z directions. If we include a y axis coming out of the page, the “wedges” become cones—and, with an undrawable z axis, hyper- cones. Because their boundaries are the trajectories of light rays, we call them the forward light cone and the backward light cone. Your future, in other words, lies within your forward light cone, your past within your backward light cone. Notice that the slope of the line connecting two events on a space-time dia- gram tells you at a glance whether the displacement between them is timelike (slope greater than 1), spacelike (slope less than 1), or lightlike (slope 1). For example, all points in the past and future are timelike with respect to your present location, whereas points in the present are spacelike, and points on the light cone are lightlike. Hermann Minkowski, who was the ﬁrst to recognize the full geometrical sig- niﬁcance of special relativity, began a famous lecture in 1908 with the words, “Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.” 12 It’s a lovely thought, but you must be careful not to read too much into it. For it is not at all the case that time is “just another coordinate, on the same footing with x, y, and z” (except that for obscure reasons we measure it on clocks instead of rulers). No: Time is utterly different from the others, and the mark of its distinction is the minus sign in the invariant interval. That minus sign imparts to spacetime a hyperbolic geometry that is much richer than the circular geometry of 3-space. Under rotations about the z axis, a point P in the xy plane describes a circle: the locus of all points a ﬁxed distance r = √x 2 + y2 from the origin (Fig. 12.23). Under Lorentz transformations, however, it is the interval I = (x 2 − c2t 2) that is preserved, and the locus of all points with a given value of I is a hyperbola—or, if we include the y axis, a hyperboloid of revolution. When the displacement is timelike, it’s a “hyperboloid of two sheets” (Fig. 12.24a); when the displacement is spacelike, it’s a “hyperboloid of one sheet” (Fig. 12.24b). When you perform a Lorentz transformation (that is, when you go into a moving inertial system), the coordinates (x, t) of a given event will change to ( ¯x, ¯t), but these new coordinates will lie on the same hyperbola as (x, t). By appropriate combinations of Lorentz transformations and rotations, a spot can be moved around at will over the surface 12A. Einstein et al., The Principle of Relativity (New York: Dover, 1923), Chapter V. 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 531 r p x y FIGURE 12.23 (a+ ct (b+ ct FIGURE 12.24 of a given hyperboloid, but no amount of transformation will carry it, say, from the upper sheet of the timelike hyperboloid to the lower sheet, or to a spacelike hyperboloid. When we were discussing simultaneity, I showed that the time ordering of two events can, at least in certain cases, be reversed, simply by going into a mov- ing system. But we now see that this is not always possible: If the displacement 4-vector between two events is timelike, their ordering is absolute; if the interval is spacelike, their ordering depends on the inertial system from which they are observed. In terms of the space-time diagram, an event on the upper sheet of a timelike hyperboloid deﬁnitely occurred after (0, 0), and one on the lower sheet certainly occurred before; but an event on a spacelike hyperboloid occurred at positive t,ornegative t, depending on your reference frame. This is not an idle curiosity, for it rescues the notion of causality, on which all physics is based. If it were always possible to reverse the order of two events, then we could never say “A caused B,” since a rival observer would retort that B preceded A.This embarrassment is avoided, provided the two events are timelike or lightlike sepa- rated. And causally related events are—otherwise no inﬂuence could travel from one to the other. Conclusion: The displacement between causally related events is always timelike, and their temporal ordering is the same for all inertial observers. 532 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Problem 12.22 (a) Draw a space-time diagram representing a game of catch (or a conversation) between two people at rest, 10 ft apart. How is it possible for them to commu- nicate, given that their separation is spacelike? (b) There’s an old limerick that runs as follows: There once was a girl named Ms. Bright, Who could travel much faster than light. She departed one day, The Einsteinian way, And returned on the previous night. What do you think? Even if she could travel faster than light, could she return before she set out? Could she arrive at some intermediate destination before she set out? Draw a space-time diagram representing this trip. Problem 12.23 Inertial system ¯S moves in the x direction at speed 3 5 c relative to system S.(The ¯x axis slides long the x axis, and the origins coincide at t = ¯t = 0, as usual.) (a) On graph paper set up a Cartesian coordinate system with axes ct and x.Care- fully draw in lines representing ¯x =−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, and 3. Also draw in the lines corresponding to c¯t =−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, and 3. Label your lines clearly. (b) In ¯S, a free particle is observed to travel from the point ¯x =−2 at time c¯t =−2 to the point ¯x = 2at c¯t =+3. Indicate this displacement on your graph. From the slope of this line, determine the particle’s speed in S. (c) Use the velocity addition rule to determine the velocity in S algebraically, and check that your answer is consistent with the graphical solution in (b). 12.2 RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS 12.2.1 Proper Time and Proper Velocity As you progress along your world line, your watch runs slow; while the clock on the wall ticks off an interval dt, your watch only advances dτ : dτ = √1 − u2/c2 dt. (12.37) (I’ll use u for the velocity of a particular object—you, in this instance—and reserve v for the relative velocity of two inertial systems.) The time τ your watch registers (or, more generally, the time associated with the moving object) is called proper time. (The word suggests a mistranslation of the French “propre”, mean- ing “own.”) In some cases, τ may be a more relevant or useful quantity than t. For one thing, proper time is invariant, whereas “ordinary” time depends on the particular reference frame you have in mind. 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 533 Now, imagine you’re on a ﬂight to Los Angeles, and the pilot announces that the plane’s velocity is 4 5 c. What precisely does he mean by “velocity”? Well, of course, he means the displacement divided by the time: u = dl dt , (12.38) and, since he is presumably talking about the velocity relative to ground, both dl and dt are to be measured by the ground observer. That’s the important number to know, if you’re concerned about being on time for an appointment in Los Angeles, but if you’re wondering whether you’ll be hungry on arrival, you might be more interested in the distance covered per unit proper time: η ≡ dl dτ . (12.39) This hybrid quantity (distance measured on the ground, over time measured in the airplane) is called proper velocity; for contrast, I’ll call u the ordinary velocity. The two are related by Eq. 12.37: η = 1 √1 − u2/c2 u. (12.40) For speeds much less than c, of course, the difference between ordinary and proper velocity is negligible. From a theoretical standpoint, however, proper velocity has an enormous ad- vantage over ordinary velocity: it transforms simply, when you go from one iner- tial system to another. In fact, η is the spatial part of a 4-vector, ημ ≡ dx μ dτ , (12.41) whose zeroth component is η0 = dx 0 dτ = c dt dτ = c √ 1 − u2/c2 , (12.42) for the numerator, dx μ, is a displacement 4-vector, while the denominator, dτ ,is invariant. Thus, for instance, when you go from system S to system ¯S,movingat speed v along the common x ¯x axis, ¯η0 = γ(η0 − βη1), ¯η1 = γ(η1 − βη0), ¯η2 = η2, ¯η3 = η3. ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (12.43) 534 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity More generally, ¯ημ = \u000b μ ν ην; (12.44) ημ is called the proper velocity 4-vector, or simply the 4-velocity. By contrast, the transformation rule for ordinary velocities is quite cumber- some, as we found in Ex. 12.6 and Prob. 12.14: ¯u x = d ¯x d ¯t = u x − v (1 − vu x /c2) , ¯u y = d ¯y d ¯t = u y γ(1 − vu x /c2) , ¯uz = d ¯z d ¯t = uz γ(1 − vu x /c2) . ⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭ (12.45) The reason for the added complexity is plain: we’re obliged to transform both the numerator dl and the denominator dt, whereas for proper velocity, the denomi- nator dτ is invariant, so the ratio inherits the transformation rule of the numerator alone. Problem 12.24 (a) Equation 12.40 deﬁnes proper velocity in terms of ordinary velocity. Invert that equation to get the formula for u in terms of η. (b) What is the relation between proper velocity and rapidity (Eq. 12.34)? Assume the velocity is along the x direction, and ﬁnd η as a function of θ . Problem 12.25 A car is traveling along the 45◦ line in S (Fig. 12.25), at (ordinary) speed (2/ √ 5)c. (a) Find the components u x and u y of the (ordinary) velocity. (b) Find the components ηx and ηy of the proper velocity. (c) Find the zeroth component of the 4-velocity, η0. System ¯S is moving in the x direction with (ordinary) speed √2/5 c, relative to S. By using the appropriate transformation laws: (d) Find the (ordinary) velocity components ¯u x and ¯u y in ¯S. x y 45° 2 5 c FIGURE 12.25 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 535 (e) Find the proper velocity components ¯ηx and ¯ηy in ¯S. (f) As a consistency check, verify that ¯η = ¯u √1 −¯u2/c2 . Problem 12.26 Find the invariant product of the 4-velocity with itself, ημημ.Is ημ• timelike, spacelike, or lightlike? Problem 12.27 A cop pulls you over and asks what speed you were going. “Well, ofﬁcer, I cannot tell a lie: the speedometer read 4 × 108 m/s.” He gives you a ticket, because the speed limit on this highway is 2.5 × 108 m/s. In court, your lawyer (who, luckily, has studied physics) points out that a car’s speedometer measures proper velocity, whereas the speed limit is ordinary velocity. Guilty, or innocent? Problem 12.28 Consider a particle in hyperbolic motion, x(t) = √b2 + (ct)2 , y = z = 0. (a) Find the proper time τ as a function of t, assuming the clocks are set so that τ = 0when t = 0. [Hint: Integrate Eq. 12.37.] (b) Find x and v (ordinary velocity) as functions of τ . (c) Find ημ (proper velocity) as a function of τ . 12.2.2 Relativistic Energy and Momentum In classical mechanics, momentum is mass times velocity. I would like to ex- tend this deﬁnition to the relativistic domain, but immediately a question arises: Should I use ordinary velocity or proper velocity? In classical physics, η and u are identical, so there is no apriori reason to favor one over the other. However, in the context of relativity it is essential that we use proper velocity, for the law of conservation of momentum would be inconsistent with the principle of relativity if we were to deﬁne momentum as mu (see Prob. 12.29). Thus p ≡ mη = mu √1 − u2/c2 ; (12.46) this is the relativistic momentum of an object of mass m traveling at (ordinary) velocity u. 13 Relativistic momentum is the spatial part of a 4-vector, pμ ≡ mημ, (12.47) 13Older treatments introduce the so-called relativistic mass, mr ≡ m/ √ 1 − u2/c2,so p can be writ- ten as mr u, but this unhelpful extra terminology has gone the way of the two-dollar bill. 536 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity and it is natural to ask what the temporal component, p0 = mη0 = mc √1 − u2/c2 (12.48) represents. Einstein identiﬁed p0c as relativistic energy: E ≡ mc2 √1 − u2/c2 ; (12.49) pμ is called the energy-momentum 4-vector (or the momentum 4-vector,for short). Notice that the relativistic energy is nonzero even when the object is stationary; we call this rest energy: Erest ≡ mc2. (12.50) The remainder, which is attributable to the motion,is kinetic energy Ekin ≡ E − mc2 = mc2 ( 1 √1 − u2/c2 − 1 ) . (12.51) In the nonrelativistic régime (u ˙ c) the square root can be expanded in powers of u2/c2,giving Ekin = 1 2 mu2 + 3 8 mu4 c2 + ··· ; (12.52) the leading term reproduces the classical formula. So far, this is all just notation.The physics resides in the experimental fact that E and p, as deﬁned by Eqs. 12.46 and 12.49, are conserved: In every closed 14 system, the total relativistic energy and momen- tum are conserved. Mass is not conserved—a fact that has been painfully familiar to everyone since 1945 (though the so-called “conversion of mass into energy” is really a conversion of rest energy into kinetic energy). Note the distinction between an invariant quantity (same value in all inertial systems) and a conserved quantity (same value before and after some process). Mass is invariant but not conserved; energy is conserved but not invariant; electric charge is both conserved and invariant; velocity is neither conserved nor invariant. The scalar product of pμ with itself is pμ pμ =−( p0)2 + (p · p) =−m2c2, (12.53) 14If there are external forces at work, then (just as in the classical case) the energy and momentum of the system itself will not, in general, be conserved. 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 537 as you can quickly check using the result of Prob. 12.26. In terms of the relativistic energy and momentum, E 2 − p2c2 = m2c4. (12.54) This result is extremely useful, for it enables you to calculate E (if you know p ≡|p|), or p (knowing E), without ever having to determine the velocity. 15 Problem 12.29 (a) Repeat Prob. 12.2(a) using the (incorrect) deﬁnition p = mu, but with the (cor- rect) Einstein velocity addition rule. Notice that if momentum (so deﬁned) is conserved in S,itis not conserved in ¯S. Assume all motion is along the x axis. (b) Now do the same using the correct deﬁnition, p = mη. Notice that if momentum (so deﬁned) is conserved in S, it is automatically also conserved in ¯S.[Hint: Use Eq. 12.43 to transform the proper velocity.] What must you assume about relativistic energy? Problem 12.30 If a particle’s kinetic energy is n times its rest energy, what is its speed? Problem 12.31 Suppose you have a collection of particles, all moving in the x direction, with energies E1, E2, E3, ...and momenta p1, p2, p3, .... Find the ve- locity of the center of momentum frame, in which the total momentum is zero. 12.2.3 Relativistic Kinematics In this section we’ll explore some applications of the conservation laws. Example 12.7. Two lumps of clay, each of (rest) mass m, collide head-on at 3 5 c (Fig. 12.26). They stick together. Question: what is the mass (M) of the composite lump? 3/5 c m M 3/5 c m (before) (after) FIGURE 12.26 15Equations 12.53 and 12.54 apply to a single particle of mass m. If you’re talking about the total energy and momentum of a collection of particles, pμ pμ is still an invariant, and you can use it to deﬁne the so-called invariant mass (− pμ pμ/c2) of the system, but this will not (in general) be the sum of the individual masses. 538 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Solution In this case conservation of momentum is trivial: zero before, zero after. The energy of each lump prior to the collision is mc2 √ 1 − (3/5)2 = 5 4 mc2, and the energy of the composite lump after the collision is Mc2 (since it’s at rest). So conservation of energy says 5 4 mc2 + 5 4 mc2 = Mc2, and hence M = 5 2 m. Notice that this is greater than the sum of the initial masses! Mass was not con- served in this collision; kinetic energy was converted into rest energy, so the mass increased. In the classical analysis of such a collision, we say that kinetic energy was converted into thermal energy—the composite lump is hotter than the two col- liding pieces. This is, of course, true in the relativistic picture too. But what is thermal energy? It’s the sum total of the random kinetic and potential energies of all the atoms and molecules in the substance. Relativity tells us that these internal energies are represented in the mass of the composite object: a hot potato is heav- ier than a cold potato, and a compressed spring is heavier than a relaxed spring. Not by much, it’s true—internal energy (U ) contributes an amount U/c2 to the mass, and c2 is a very large number by everyday standards. You could never get two lumps of clay going anywhere near fast enough to detect the nonconservation of mass in their collision. But in the realm of elementary particles, the effect can be very striking. For example, when the neutral pi meson (mass 2.4 × 10 −28 kg) decays into an electron and a positron (each of mass 9.11 × 10 −31 kg), the rest energy is converted almost entirely into kinetic energy—less than 1% of the orig- inal mass remains. In classical mechanics, there’s no such thing as a massless (m = 0) particle— its kinetic energy ( 1 2 mu2) and its momentum (mu) would be zero, you couldn’t apply a force to it (F = ma), and hence (by Newton’s third law) it couldn’t ex- ert a force on anything else—it’s a cipher, as far as physics is concerned. You might at ﬁrst assume that the same is true in relativity; after all, p and E are still proportional to m. However, a closer inspection of Eqs. 12.46 and 12.49 reveals a loophole worthy of a congressman: If u = c, then the zero in the numerator is balanced by a zero in the denominator, leaving p and E indeterminate (zero over zero). It is just conceivable, therefore, that a massless particle could carry energy and momentum, provided it always travels at the speed of light. Although 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 539 Eqs. 12.46 and 12.49 would no longer sufﬁce to determine E and p, Eq. 12.54 suggests that the two should be related by E = pc. (12.55) Personally, I would regard this argument as a joke, were it not for the fact that at least one massless particle is known to exist in nature: the photon. 16 Photons do travel at the speed of light, and they obey Eq. 12.55.17 They force us to take the “loophole” seriously. (By the way, you might ask what distinguishes a photon with a lot of energy from one with very little—after all, they have the same mass (zero) and the same speed (c). Relativity offers no answer to this question; curiously, quantum mechanics does: According to the Planck formula, E = hν, where h is Planck’s constant and ν is the frequency. A blue photon is more energetic than a red one!) Example 12.8. A pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino (Fig. 12.27). Find the energy of the outgoing muon, in terms of the two masses, mπ and mμ (assume mν = 0). v π (before) (after) μ FIGURE 12.27 Solution In this case, Ebefore = mπ c2, pbefore = 0, Eafter = Eμ + Eν, pafter = pμ + pν. Conservation of momentum requires that pν =−pμ. Conservation of energy says that Eμ + Eν = mπ c2. Now, Eν =|pν|c, by Eq. 12.55, whereas |pμ|= √E 2 μ − m2 μc4 /c, by Eq. 12.54, so Eμ + √E 2 μ − m2 μc4 = mπ c2, 16Until recently, neutrinos were also assumed to be massless, but experiments in 1998 indicate that they in fact carry a (very small) mass. 17The photon is the quantum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and it is no accident that the same ratio between energy and momentum holds for electromagnetic waves (see Eqs. 9.60 and 9.62). 540 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity from which it follows that Eμ = (m2 π + m2 μ)c2 2mπ . In a classical collision, momentum and mass are always conserved, whereas kinetic energy, in general, is not. A “sticky” collision generates heat at the expense of kinetic energy; an “explosive” collision generates kinetic energy at the expense of chemical energy (or some other kind). If the kinetic energy is conserved, as in the ideal collision of the two billiard balls, we call the process “elastic.” In the relativistic case, momentum and total energy are always conserved, but mass and kinetic energy, in general, are not. Once again, we call the process elastic if kinetic energy is conserved. In such a case the rest energy (being the total minus the kinetic) is also conserved, and therefore so too is the mass. In practice, this means that the same particles come out as went in. Examples 12.7 and 12.8 were inelastic processes; the next one is elastic. Example 12.9. Compton scattering. A photon of energy E0 “bounces” off an electron, initially at rest. Find the energy E of the outgoing photon, as a function of the scattering angle θ (see Fig. 12.28). (before) Electron E0 Photon (after) θ E Electron Photon φ FIGURE 12.28 Solution Conservation of momentum in the “vertical” direction gives pe sin φ = p p sin θ , or, since p p = E/c, sin φ = E pec sin θ. Conservation of momentum in the “horizontal” direction gives E0 c = p p cos θ + pe cos φ = E c cos θ + pe √ 1 − ( E pec sin θ )2 , 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 541 or p2 e c2 = (E0 − E cos θ)2 + E 2 sin 2 θ = E 2 0 − 2E0 E cos θ + E 2. Finally, conservation of energy says that E0 + mc2 = E + Ee = E + √ m2c4 + p2 e c2 = E + √m2c4 + E 2 0 − 2E0 E cos θ + E 2. Solving for E, I ﬁnd that E = 1 (1 − cos θ ) /mc2 + (1/E0) . (12.56) The answer looks nicer when expressed in terms of photon wavelength: E = hν = hc λ , so λ = λ0 + h mc (1 − cos θ). (12.57) The quantity (h/mc) is called the Compton wavelength of the electron. Problem 12.32 Find the velocity of the muon in Ex. 12.8. Problem 12.33 A particle of mass m whose total energy is twice its rest energy collides with an identical particle at rest. If they stick together, what is the mass of the resulting composite particle? What is its velocity? Problem 12.34 A neutral pion of (rest) mass m and (relativistic) momentum p = 3 4 mc decays into two photons. One of the photons is emitted in the same direction as the original pion, and the other in the opposite direction. Find the (relativistic) energy of each photon. Problem 12.35 In the past, most experiments in particle physics involved stationary targets: one particle (usually a proton or an electron) was accelerated to a high energy E, and collided with a target particle at rest (Fig. 12.29a). Far higher relative energies are obtainable (with the same accelerator) if you accelerate both particles to energy E, and ﬁre them at each other (Fig. 12.29b). Classically, the energy ¯E of one particle, relative to the other, is just 4E (why?) . . . not much of a gain (only a factor of 4). But relativistically the gain can be enormous. Assuming the two particles have the same mass, m, show that ¯E = 2E 2 mc2 − mc2. (12.58) 542 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity E Target E E (a) (b) FIGURE 12.29 Suppose you use protons (mc2 = 1 GeV) with E = 30 GeV. What ¯E do you get? What multiple of E does this amount to? (1 GeV=10 9 electron volts.) [Because of this relativistic enhancement, most modern elementary particle experiments involve colliding beams, instead of ﬁxed targets.] Problem 12.36 In a pair annihilation experiment, an electron (mass m) with mo- mentum pe hits a positron (same mass, but opposite charge) at rest. They annihilate, producing two photons. (Why couldn’t they produce just one photon?) If one of the photons emerges at 60◦ to the incident electron direction, what is its energy? 12.2.4 Relativistic Dynamics Newton’s ﬁrst law is built into the principle of relativity. His second law, in the form F = dp dt , (12.59) retains its validity in relativistic mechanics, provided we use the relativistic mo- mentum. Example 12.10. Motion under a constant force. A particle of mass m is subject to a constant force F. If it starts from rest at the origin, at time t = 0, ﬁnd its position (x), as a function of time. Solution dp dt = F ⇒ p = Ft + constant, but since p = 0at t = 0, the constant must be zero, and hence p = mu √1 − u2/c2 = Ft. Solving for u, we obtain u = (F/m)t √1 + (Ft/mc)2 . (12.60) The numerator, of course, is the classical answer—it’s approximately right, if (F/m)t ˙ c. But the relativistic denominator ensures that u never exceeds c;in fact, as t →∞, u → c. 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 543 To complete the problem we must integrate again: x(t) = F m ∫ t 0 t [ √ 1 + (Ft [/mc)2 dt [ = mc2 F √ 1 + (Ft [/mc)2∣ ∣ ∣ t 0 = mc2 F [√ 1 + (Ft/mc)2 − 1 ] . (12.61) In place of the classical parabola, x(t) = (F/2m)t 2, the graph is a hyperbola (Fig. 12.30); for this reason, motion under a constant force is often called hyperbolic motion. It occurs, for example, when a charged particle is placed in a uniform electric ﬁeld. ct x 45° Classical (parabola) Relativistic (hyperbola) FIGURE 12.30 Work, as always, is the line integral of the force: W ≡ ∫ F · dl. (12.62) The work-energy theorem (“the net work done on a particle equals the increase in its kinetic energy”) holds relativistically: W = ∫ dp dt · dl = ∫ dp dt · dl dt dt = ∫ dp dt · u dt, while dp dt · u = d dt ( mu √1 − u2/c2 ) · u = mu (1 − u2/c2)3/2 · du dt = d dt ( mc2 √ 1 − u2/c2 ) = dE dt , (12.63) 544 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity so W = ∫ dE dt dt = Eﬁnal − Einitial. (12.64) (Since the rest energy is constant, it doesn’t matter whether we use the total en- ergy, here, or the kinetic energy.) Unlike the ﬁrst two, Newton’s third law does not, in general, extend to the relativistic domain. Indeed, if the two objects in question are separated in space, the third law is incompatible with the relativity of simultaneity. For suppose the force of A on B at some instant t is F(t), and the force of B on A at the same in- stant is −F(t); then the third law applies in this reference frame. But a moving observer will report that these equal and opposite forces occurred at different times; in his system, therefore, the third law is violated. Only in the case of con- tact interactions, where the two forces are applied at the same physical point (and in the trivial case where the forces are constant) can the third law be retained. Because F is the derivative of momentum with respect to ordinary time, it shares the ugly behavior of (ordinary) velocity, when you go from one inertial system to another: both the numerator and the denominator must be transformed. Thus,18 ¯Fy = d ¯py d ¯t = dpy γ dt − γβ c dx = dpy/dt γ ( 1 − β c dx dt ) = Fy γ(1 − βu x /c) , (12.65) and similarly for the z component: ¯Fz = Fz γ(1 − βu x /c) . The x component is even worse: ¯Fx = d ¯px d ¯t = γ dpx − γβ dp0 γ dt − γβ c dx = dpx dt − β dp0 dt 1 − β c dx dt = Fx − β c ( dE dt ) 1 − βu x /c . We calculated dE/dt in Eq. 12.63; putting that in, ¯Fx = Fx − β(u · F)/c 1 − βu x /c . (12.66) In one special case these equations are reasonably tractable: If the particle is (in- stantaneously) at rest in S, so that u = 0, then ¯F⊥ = 1 γ F⊥, ¯F∥ = F∥. (12.67) 18Remember: γ and β pertain to the motion of ¯S with respect S—they are constants; u is the velocity of the particle with respect to S. 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 545 That is, the component of F parallel to the motion of ¯S is unchanged, whereas perpendicular components are divided by γ . It has perhaps occurred to you that we could avoid the bad transformation behavior of F by introducing a “proper” force, analogous to proper velocity, which would be the derivative of momentum with respect to proper time: K μ ≡ dpμ dτ . (12.68) This is called the Minkowski force; it is plainly a 4-vector, since pμ is a 4-vector and proper time is invariant. The spatial components of K μ are related to the “ordinary” force by K = ( dt dτ ) dp dt = 1 √ 1 − u2/c2 F, (12.69) while the zeroth component, K 0 = dp0 dτ = 1 c dE dτ , (12.70) is, apart from the 1/c, the (proper) rate at which the energy of the particle increases—in other words, the (proper) power delivered to the particle. Relativistic dynamics can be formulated in terms of the ordinary force or in terms of the Minkowski force. The latter is generally much neater, but since in the long run we are interested in the particle’s trajectory as a function of ordinary time, the former is often more useful. When we wish to generalize some classical force law, such as Lorentz’s, to the relativistic domain, the question arises: Does the classical formula correspond to the ordinary force or to the Minkowski force? In other words, should we write F = q(E + u × B), or should it rather be K = q(E + u × B)? Since proper time and ordinary time are identical in classical physics, there is no way at this stage to decide the issue. The Lorentz force, as it turns out, is an ordinary force—later on I’ll explain why this is so, and show you how to construct the electromagnetic Minkowski force. Example 12.11. The typical trajectory of a charged particle in a uniform mag- netic ﬁeld is cyclotron motion (Fig. 12.31). The magnetic force pointing toward the center, F = Qu B, 546 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity R ' u B FIGURE 12.31 dθ dθp + dp dp p + dpp p FIGURE 12.32 provides the centripetal acceleration necessary to sustain circular motion. Beware, however—in special relativity the centripetal force is not mu2/R, as in classical mechanics. Rather, as you can see from Fig. 12.32, dp = pdθ ,so F = dp dt = p dθ dt = p u R . (Classically, of course, p = mu,so F = mu2/R.) Thus, Qu B = p u R , or p = QB R. (12.71) In this form, the relativistic cyclotron formula is identical to the nonrelativistic one, Eq. 5.3—the only difference is that p is now the relativistic momentum. In classical mechanics, the total momentum (P) of a collection of interacting particles can be expressed as the total mass (M) times the velocity of the center- of-mass: P = M dRm dt . In relativity the center-of-mass (Rm = 1 M ∑ mi ri ) is replaced by the center-of- energy (Re = 1 E ∑ Ei ri , where E is the total energy), and M by E/c2: P = E c2 dRe dt . (12.72) P now includes all forms of momentum, and E all forms of energy—not just mechanical, but also whatever may be stored in the ﬁelds.19 19The proof of Eq. 12.72 is not trivial. See S. Coleman and J. H. Van Vleck, Phys. Rev. 171, 1370 (1968) or M. G. Calkin, Am.J.Phys. 39, 513 (1971). 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 547 Example 12.12. In Example 8.3 we found that the momentum stored in the ﬁelds of a coaxial cable is not zero, even though the cable itself is at rest. At the time, this seemed paradoxical. However, energy is being transported, from the battery to the resistor, and hence the center-of-energy is in motion. Indeed, if the battery is at z = 0, so the resistor is at z = l, then Re = (E0R0 + E Rl ˆz)/E, where E R is the energy in the resistor, E0 is the rest of the energy, and R0 is the center-of-energy of E0,so dRe dt = (dE R/dt)l E ˆz = IV l E ˆz. According to Eq. 12.72, then, the total momentum should be P = IV l c2 ˆz, which is exactly the momentum in the ﬁelds, as calculated in Example 8.3. If this still seems strange to you, imagine a shoe-box, with a marble inside that we cannot see. The box is at rest, but the marble is rolling from one end to the other. Is there momentum in this system? Yes, of course, even though the box is stationary—there is the momentum of the marble. In the case of the coaxial cable, no actual object is in motion (well, the electrons are, but there are just as many of them going one way as the other, and their net momentum is zero), but energy is ﬂowing from one end to the other, and in relativity all forms of energy in motion, not just rest energy (mass), constitute momentum. The “marble” (in this analogy) is the electromagnetic ﬁeld, which transports energy, and therefore contributes momentum . . . even though the ﬁelds themselves are perfectly static! 20 In the following example, the center of energy is at rest, so the total momentum must be zero (Eq. 12.72). But the (static) electromagnetic ﬁelds do carry momen- tum, and the problem is to locate the compensating mechanical momentum. Example 12.13. As a model for a magnetic dipole m, consider a rectangular loop of wire carrying a steady current I . Picture the current as a stream of non- interacting positive charges that move freely within the wire. When a uniform electric ﬁeld E is applied (Fig. 12.33), the charges accelerate in the left segment and decelerate in the right one.21 Find the total momentum of all the charges in the loop. Solution The momenta of the left and right segments cancel, so we need only consider the top and the bottom. Say there are N+ charges in the top segment, going at speed 20This problem was incorrectly analyzed in the third edition—see T. H. Boyer, Am.J.Phys. 76,190 (2008). 21This is not a very realistic model for a current-carrying wire, obviously, but other models lead to exactly the same result. See V. Hnizdo, Am.J.Phys. 65, 92 (1997). 548 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity u− I I I I u+ Ew l FIGURE 12.33 u+ to the right, and N− charges in the lower segment, going at (slower) speed u− to the left. The current (I = λu) is the same in all four segments (or else charge would be piling up somewhere); in particular, I = QN+ l u+ = QN− l u−, so N±u± = Il Q , where Q is the charge of each particle, and l is the length of the rectangle. Clas- sically, the momentum of a single particle is p = Mu (where M is its mass), and the total momentum (to the right) is pclassical = MN+u+ − MN−u− = M Il Q − M Il Q = 0, as one would certainly expect (after all, the loop as a whole is not moving). But relativistically, p = γ Mu, and we get p = γ+ MN+u+ − γ− MN−u− = MI l Q (γ+ − γ−), which is not zero, because the particles in the upper segment are moving faster. In fact, the gain in energy (γ Mc2), as a particle goes up the left segment, is equal to the work done by the electric force, QEw, where w is the height of the rectangle, so γ+ − γ− = QEw Mc2 , and hence p = Il Ew c2 . But Ilw is the magnetic dipole moment of the loop; as vectors, m points into the page and p is to the right, so p = 1 c2 (m × E). (12.73) 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 549 Thus a magnetic dipole at rest in an electric ﬁeld carries linear momentum, even though it is not moving! This so-called hidden momentum is strictly relativistic, and purely mechanical; it precisely cancels the electromagnetic momentum stored in the ﬁelds (Eq. 8.45). 22 Problem 12.37 In classical mechanics, Newton’s law can be written in the more familiar form F = ma. The relativistic equation, F = dp/dt, cannot be so simply expressed. Show, rather, that F = m √1 − u2/c2 [a + u(u · a) c2 − u2 ] , (12.74) where a ≡ du/dt is the ordinary acceleration. Problem 12.38 Show that it is possible to outrun a light ray, if you’re given a sufﬁ- cient head start, and your feet generate a constant force. Problem 12.39 Deﬁne proper acceleration in the obvious way: αμ ≡ dημ dτ = d 2x μ dτ 2 . (12.75) (a) Find α0 and ααα in terms of u and a (the ordinary acceleration). (b) Express αμαμ in terms of u and a. (c) Show that ημαμ = 0. (d) Write the Minkowski version of Newton’s second law, Eq. 12.68, in terms of αμ. Evaluate the invariant product K μημ. Problem 12.40 Show that Kμ K μ = 1 − (u2/c2) cos2 θ 1 − u2/c2 F 2, where θ is the angle between u and F. Problem 12.41 Show that the (ordinary) acceleration of a particle of mass m and charge q, moving at velocity u under the inﬂuence of electromagnetic ﬁelds E and B,isgiven by a = q m √1 − u2/c2 [E + u × B − 1 c2 u(u · E) ] . [Hint: Use Eq. 12.74.] 22For more on hidden momentum, look again at Problem 8.6, and the reference cited there. 550 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity 12.3 RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 12.3.1 Magnetism as a Relativistic Phenomenon Unlike Newtonian mechanics, classical electrodynamics is already consistent with special relativity. Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law can be ap- plied legitimately in any inertial system. Of course, what one observer interprets as an electrical process another may regard as magnetic, but the actual particle motions they predict will be identical. To the extent that this did not work out for Lorentz and others, who studied the question in the late nineteenth century, the fault lay with the nonrelativistic mechanics they used, not with the electro- dynamics. Having corrected Newtonian mechanics, we are now in a position to develop a complete and consistent formulation of relativistic electrodynamics. I emphasize that we will not be changing the rules of electrodynamics in the slightest—rather, we will be expressing these rules in a notation that exposes and illuminates their relativistic character. As we go along, I shall pause now and then to rederive, using the Lorentz transformations, results obtained earlier by more laborious means. But the main purpose of this section is to provide you with a deeper understanding of the structure of electrodynamics—laws that had seemed arbitrary and unrelated before take on a kind of coherence and inevitability when approached from the point of view of relativity. To begin with, I’d like to show you why there had to be such a thing as mag- netism, given electrostatics and relativity, and how, in particular, you can calculate the magnetic force between a current-carrying wire and a moving charge with- out ever invoking the laws of magnetism.23 Suppose you had a string of positive charges moving along to the right at speed v. I’ll assume the charges are close enough together so that we may treat them as a continuous line charge λ. Super- imposed on this positive string is a negative one, −λ proceeding to the left at the same speed v. We have, then, a net current to the right, of magnitude I = 2λv. (12.76) Meanwhile, a distance s away there is a point charge q traveling to the right at speed u <v (Fig. 12.34a). Because the two line charges cancel, there is no electrical force on q in this system (S). However, let’s examine the same situation from the point of view of system ¯S, which moves to the right with speed u (Fig. 12.34b). In this reference frame, q is at rest. By the Einstein velocity addition rule, the velocities of the positive and negative lines are now v± = v ∓ u 1 ∓ vu/c2 . (12.77) 23This and several other arguments in this section are adapted from E. M. Purcell’s Electricity and Magnetism, 2d ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1985). 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 551 v v −−− (−λ) (+λ) −−− +++ +++ u s q v− v+ −−− −−−(λ −) (λ+)++ ++ s q (a) (b) FIGURE 12.34 Because v− is greater than v+, the Lorentz contraction of the spacing between negative charges is more severe than that between positive charges; in this frame, therefore, the wire carries a net negative charge! In fact, λ± =±(γ±)λ0, (12.78) where γ± = 1 √1 − v2 ±/c2 , (12.79) and λ0 is the charge density of the positive line in its own rest system. That’s not the same as λ, of course—in S they’re already moving at speed v,so λ = γλ0, (12.80) where γ = 1 √1 − v2/c2 . (12.81) 552 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity It takes some algebra to put γ± into simple form: γ± = 1 √1 − 1 c2 (v ∓ u)2(1 ∓ vu/c2)−2 = c2 ∓ uv √ (c2 ∓ uv)2 − c2(v ∓ u)2 = c2 ∓ uv √(c2 − v2)(c2 − u2) = γ 1 ∓ uv/c2 √1 − u2/c2 . (12.82) The net line charge in ¯S, then, is λtot = λ+ + λ− = λ0(γ+ − γ−) = −2λuv c2√ 1 − u2/c2 . (12.83) Conclusion: As a result of unequal Lorentz contraction of the positive and nega- tive lines, a current-carrying wire that is electrically neutral in one inertial system will be charged in another. Now, a line charge λtot sets up an electric ﬁeld E = λtot 2πϵ0s , so there is an electrical force on q in ¯S, to wit: ¯F = qE =− λv πϵ0c2s qu √1 − u2/c2 . (12.84) But if there’s a force on q in ¯S, there must be one in S; in fact, we can calculate it by using the transformation rules for forces. Since q is at rest in ¯S, and ¯F is perpendicular to u,the forcein S is given by Eq. 12.67: F = √1 − u2/c2 ¯F =− λv πϵ0c2 qu s . (12.85) The charge is attracted toward the wire by a force that is purely electrical in ¯S (where the wire is charged, and q is at rest), but distinctly nonelectrical in S (where the wire is neutral). Taken together, then, electrostatics and relativity im- ply the existence of another force. This “other force” is, of course, magnetic. In fact, we can cast Eq. 12.85 into more familiar form by using c2 = (ϵ0μ0)−1 and expressing λv in terms of the current (Eq. 12.76): F =−qu ( μ0 I 2π s ) . (12.86) The term in parentheses is the magnetic ﬁeld of a long straight wire, and the force is precisely what we would have obtained by using the Lorentz force law in system S. 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 553 12.3.2 How the Fields Transform We have learned, in various special cases, that one observer’s electric ﬁeld is another’s magnetic ﬁeld. It would be nice to know the general transformation rules for electromagnetic ﬁelds: Given the ﬁelds in S, what are the ﬁelds in ¯S? Your ﬁrst guess might be that E is the spatial part of one 4-vector and B the spatial part of another. But your guess would be wrong—it’s more complicated than that. Let me begin by making explicit an assumption that was already used implicitly in Sect. 12.3.1: Charge is invariant. Like mass, but unlike energy, the charge of a particle is a ﬁxed number, independent of how fast it happens to be moving. We shall assume also that the transformation rules are the same no matter how the ﬁelds were produced—electric ﬁelds associated with changing magnetic ﬁelds transform the same way as those set up by stationary charges. Were this not the case we’d have to abandon the ﬁeld formulation altogether, for it is the essence of a ﬁeld theory that the ﬁelds at a given point tell you all there is to know, electromagnetically, about that point; you do not have to append extra information regarding their source. With this in mind, consider the simplest possible electric ﬁeld: the uni- form ﬁeld in the region between the plates of a large parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 12.35a). Say the capacitor is at rest in S0 and carries surface charges ±σ0. Then E0 = σ0 ϵ0 ˆy. (12.87) y0 x0 w l0 z0 −σ0 +σ0 y x w l z −σ +σ +σ v0 v0 v (a) (b) −σ v (c) v FIGURE 12.35 554 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity What if we examine this same capacitor from system S, moving to the right at speed v0 (Fig. 12.35b)? In this system the plates are moving to the left, but the ﬁeld still takes the form E = σ ϵ0 ˆy; (12.88) the only difference is the value of the surface charge σ . [Wait a minute! Is that the only difference? The formula E = σ/ϵ0 for a parallel plate capacitor came from Gauss’s law, and whereas Gauss’s law is perfectly valid for moving charges, this application also relies on symmetry. Are we sure that the ﬁeld is still perpendicular to the plates? What if the ﬁeld of a moving plane tilts, say, along the direction of motion, as in Fig. 12.35c? Well, even if it did (it doesn’t), the ﬁeld between the plates, being the superposition of the +σ ﬁeld and the −σ ﬁeld, would still run perpendicular to the plates (changing the sign of the charge reverses the direction of the ﬁeld, and the vector sum kills off the parallel components).] Now, the total charge on each plate is invariant, and the width (w) is un- changed, but the length (l) is Lorentz-contracted by a factor of γ0 = 1 √1 − v2 0/c2 , (12.89) so the charge per unit area is increased by a factor of γ0: σ = γ0σ0. (12.90) Accordingly, E ⊥ = γ0E0⊥. (12.91) I have put in the superscript ⊥ to make it clear that this rule pertains to com- ponents of E that are perpendicular to the direction of motion of S. To get the rule for parallel components, consider the capacitor lined up with the yz plane y x l w z d −σ+σ FIGURE 12.36 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 555 (Fig. 12.36). This time it is the plate separation (d) that is Lorentz-contracted, whereas l and w (and hence also σ ) are the same in both frames. Since the ﬁeld does not depend on d,itfollows that E ∥ = E0∥. (12.92) Example 12.14. Electric ﬁeld of a point charge in uniform motion. A point charge q is at rest at the origin in system S0. Question: What is the electric ﬁeld of this same charge in system S, which moves to the right at speed v0 relative to S0? Solution In S0, the ﬁeld is E0 = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 0 ˆr0, or ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ Ex 0 = 1 4πϵ0 qx0 (x 2 0 + y2 0 + z2 0)3/2 , E y 0 = 1 4πϵ0 qy0 (x 2 0 + y2 0 + z2 0)3/2 , Ez 0 = 1 4πϵ0 qz0 (x 2 0 + y2 0 + z2 0)3/2 . From the transformation rules (Eqs. 12.91 and 12.92), we have ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ Ex = Ex 0 = 1 4πϵ0 qx0 (x 2 0 + y2 0 + z2 0)3/2 , E y = γ0 E y 0 = 1 4πϵ0 γ0qy0 (x 2 0 + y2 0 + z2 0)3/2 , Ez = γ0 Ez 0 = 1 4πϵ0 γ0qz0 (x 2 0 + y2 0 + z2 0)3/2 . These are still expressed in terms of the S0 coordinates (x0, y0, z0) of the ﬁeld point (P); I’d prefer to write them in terms of the S coordinates of P.Fromthe Lorentz transformations (or, actually, the inverse transformations), ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ x0 = γ0(x + v0t) = γ0 Rx , y0 = y = Ry, z0 = z = Rz, 556 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity θ R P q y x z v0 v0t FIGURE 12.37 where R is the vector from q to P (Fig. 12.37). Thus E = 1 4πϵ0 γ0qR (γ 2 0 R2 cos2 θ + R2 sin 2 θ)3/2 = 1 4πϵ0 q(1 − v2 0/c2) [1 − (v2 0/c2) sin 2 θ ]3/2 ˆR R2 . (12.93) This, then, is the ﬁeld of a charge in uniform motion; we got the same result in Chapter 10 using the retarded potentials (Eq. 10.75). The present derivation is far more efﬁcient, and sheds some light on the remarkable fact that the ﬁeld points away from the instantaneous (as opposed to the retarded) position of the charge: Ex gets a factor of γ0 from the Lorentz transformation of the coordinates; E y and Ez pick up theirs from the transformation of the ﬁeld. It’s the balancing of these two γ0’s that leaves E parallel to R. But Eqs. 12.91 and 12.92 are not the most general transformation laws, for we began with a system S0 in which the charges were at rest and where, consequently, there was no magnetic ﬁeld. To derive the general rule, we must start out in a system with both electric and magnetic ﬁelds. For this purpose S itself will serve nicely. In addition to the electric ﬁeld E y = σ ϵ0 , (12.94) there is a magnetic ﬁeld due to the surface currents (Fig. 12.35b): K± =∓σv0 ˆx. (12.95) By the right-hand rule, this ﬁeld points in the negative z direction; its magnitude is given by Ampère’s law (Ex. 5.8): Bz =−μ0σv0. (12.96) In a third system, ¯S, traveling to the right with speed v relative to S (Fig. 12.38), the ﬁelds would be ¯E y = ¯σ ϵ0 , ¯Bz =−μ0 ¯σ ¯v, (12.97) 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 557 y0 x0 y x y x v0 v S0 S S (v relative to S) FIGURE 12.38 where ¯v is the velocity of ¯S relative to S0: ¯v = v + v0 1 + vv0/c2 , ¯γ = 1 √1 −¯v2/c2 , (12.98) and ¯σ =¯γσ0. (12.99) It remains only to express ¯E and ¯B (Eq. 12.97), in terms of E and B (Eqs. 12.94 and 12.96). In view of Eqs. 12.90 and 12.99, we have ¯E y = ( ¯γ γ0 ) σ ϵ0 , ¯Bz =− ( ¯γ γ0 ) μ0σ ¯v. (12.100) With a little algebra, you can show that ¯γ γ0 = √1 − v2 0/c2 √1 −¯v2/c2 = 1 + vv0/c2 √ 1 − v2/c2 = γ ( 1 + vv0 c2 ) , (12.101) where γ = 1 √1 − v2/c2 , (12.102) as always. Thus, writing ¯E y in terms of the components of E and B in S, ¯E y = γ ( 1 + vv0 c2 ) σ ϵ0 = γ (E y − v c2ϵ0μ0 Bz ) , whereas ¯Bz =−γ ( 1 + vv0 c2 ) μ0σ ( v + v0 1 + vv0/c2 ) = γ(Bz − μ0ϵ0v E y). 558 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity y x z v0 −σ +σ FIGURE 12.39 Or, since μ0ϵ0 = 1/c2, ¯E y = γ(E y − v Bz), ¯Bz = γ (Bz − v c2 E y) . ⎫ ⎪⎬ ⎪⎭ (12.103) This tells us how E y and Bz transform—to do Ez and By, we simply align the same capacitor parallel to the xy plane instead of the xz plane (Fig. 12.39). The ﬁelds in S are then Ez = σ ϵ0 , By = μ0σv0. (Use the right-hand rule to get the sign of By.) The rest of the argument is identical—everywhere we had E y before, read Ez, and everywhere we had Bz, read −By: ¯Ez = γ(Ez + v By), ¯By = γ (By + v c2 Ez) . ⎫ ⎪⎬ ⎪⎭ (12.104) As for the x components, we have already seen (by orienting the capacitor parallel to the yz plane) that ¯Ex = Ex . (12.105) Since in this case there is no accompanying magnetic ﬁeld, we cannot deduce the transformation rule for Bx . But another conﬁguration will do the job: Imagine a long solenoid aligned parallel to the x axis (Fig. 12.40) and at rest in S.The magnetic ﬁeld within the coil is Bx = μ0nI, (12.106) 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 559 y z I x FIGURE 12.40 where n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current. In system ¯S, the length contracts, so n increases: ¯n = γ n. (12.107) On the other hand, time dilates: The S clock, which rides along with the solenoid, runs slow, so the current (charge per unit time) in ¯S is given by ¯I = 1 γ I. (12.108) The two factors of γ exactly cancel, and we conclude that ¯Bx = Bx . Like E, the component of B parallel to the motion is unchanged. Here, then, is the complete set of transformation rules: ¯Ex = Ex , ¯E y = γ(E y − v Bz), ¯Ez = γ(Ez + v By), ¯Bx = Bx , ¯By = γ (By + v c2 Ez) , ¯Bz = γ (Bz − v c2 E y) . (12.109) Two special cases warrant particular attention: 1. If B = 0 in S, then ¯B = γ v c2 (Ez ˆy − E y ˆz) = v c2 ( ¯Ez ˆy − ¯E y ˆz), or, since v = v ˆx, ¯B =− 1 c2 (v × ¯E). (12.110) 560 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity 2. If E = 0 in S, then ¯E =−γv(Bz ˆy − By ˆz) =−v( ¯Bz ˆy − ¯By ˆz), or ¯E = v × ¯B. (12.111) In other words, if either E or B is zero (at a particular point) in one system, then in any other system the ﬁelds (at that point) are very simply related by Eq. 12.110 or Eq. 12.111. Example 12.15. Magnetic ﬁeld of a point charge in uniform motion. Find the magnetic ﬁeld of a point charge q moving at constant velocity v. Solution In the particle’s rest frame the magnetic ﬁeld is zero (everywhere), so in a system moving with velocity −v (in which the particle is moving at velocity +v) 24 B = 1 c2 (v × E). We calculated the electric ﬁeld in Ex. 12.14. The magnetic ﬁeld, then, is B = μ0 4π qv(1 − v2/c2) sin θ [1 − (v2/c2) sin 2 θ ]3/2 ˆφ R2 , (12.112) where ˆφ aims counterclockwise as you face the oncoming charge. Incidentally, in the nonrelativistic limit (v2 ˙ c2), Eq. 12.112 reduces to B ≈ μ0 4π q v × ˆR R2 , which is exactly what you would get by naïve application of the Biot-Savart law to a point charge (Eq. 5.43). Problem 12.42 Why can’t the electric ﬁeld in Fig. 12.35b have a z component? After all, the magnetic ﬁeld does. Problem 12.43 A parallel-plate capacitor, at rest in S0 and tilted at a 45◦ angle to the x0 axis, carries charge densities ±σ0 on the two plates (Fig. 12.41). System S is moving to the right at speed v relative to S0. 24Here v is the particle’s velocity; in Eq. 12.110 it was the velocity of the reference frame. 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 561 y0 x0 z0 45° −σ0 +σ0 FIGURE 12.41 (a) Find E0, the ﬁeld in S0. (b) Find E, the ﬁeld in S. (c) What angle do the plates make with the x axis? (d) Is the ﬁeld perpendicular to the plates in S? Problem 12.44 In system S0, a static uniform line charge λ coincides with the z axis. (a) Write the electric ﬁeld E0 in Cartesian coordinates, for the point (x0, y0, z0). (b) Use Eq. 12.109 to ﬁnd the electric in S, which moves with speed v in the x direction with respect to S0. The ﬁeld is still in terms of (x0, y0, z0); express it instead in terms of the coordinates (x, y, z) in S. Finally, write E in terms of the vector S from the present location of the wire and the angle θ between S and ˆx. Does the ﬁeld point away from the instantaneous location of the wire, like the ﬁeld of a uniformly moving point charge? Problem 12.45 (a) Charge q A is at rest at the origin in system S;charge qB ﬂies by at speed v on a trajectory parallel to the x axis, but at y = d. What is the electromagnetic force on qB as it crosses the y axis? (b) Now study the same problem from system ¯S, which moves to the right with speed v. What is the force on qB when q A passes the ¯y axis?

Find the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in ¯S, and express them in terms of the ¯S coordinates: ¯E( ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯t) and ¯B( ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯t). [Again, be sure to deﬁne any auxiliary quantities you introduce.] (c) What is the frequency ¯ω of the wave in ¯S? Interpret this result.

As a youth, Ein- stein wondered what an electromagnetic wave would look like if you could run along beside it at the speed of light. What can you tell him about the amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the wave, as v approaches c? 12.3.3 The Field Tensor As Eq. 12.109 indicates, E and B certainly do not transform like the spatial parts of the two 4-vectors—in fact, the components of E and B are stirred together when you go from one inertial system to another. What sort of an object is this, which has six components and transforms according to Eq. 12.109? Answer:It’s an antisymmetric, second-rank tensor. Remember that a 4-vector transforms by the rule ¯aμ = \u000b μ ν aν (12.113) 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 563 (summation over ν implied), where \u000b is the Lorentz transformation matrix. If ¯S is moving in the x direction at speed v, \u000b has the form \u000b = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ γ −γβ 00 −γβ γ 00 00 1 0 00 0 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , (12.114) and \u000b μ ν is the entry in row μ, column ν. A (second-rank) tensor is an object with two indices, which transforms with two factors of \u000b (one for each index): ¯t μν = \u000b μ λ \u000b ν σ t λσ . (12.115) A tensor (in 4 dimensions) has 4 × 4 = 16 components, which we can display in a4 × 4 array: t μν = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ t 00 t 01 t 02 t 03 t 10 t 11 t 12 t 13 t 20 t 21 t 22 t 23 t 30 t 31 t 32 t 33 ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ . However, the 16 elements need not all be different. For instance, a symmetric tensor has the property t μν = t νμ (symmetric tensor). (12.116) In this case there are 10 distinct components; 6 of the 16 are repeats (t 01 = t 10, t 02 = t 20, t 03 = t 30, t 12 = t 21, t 13 = t 31, t 23 = t 32). Similarly, an antisymmetric tensor obeys t μν =−t νμ (antisymmetric tensor). (12.117) Such an object has just 6 distinct elements—of the original 16, six are repeats (the same ones as before, only this time with a minus sign) and four are zero (t 00, t 11, t 22, and t 33). Thus, the general antisymmetric tensor has the form t μν = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ 0 t 01 t 02 t 03 −t 01 0 t 12 t 13 −t 02 −t 12 0 t 23 −t 03 −t 13 −t 23 0 ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ . Let’s see how the transformation rule (Eq. 12.115) works, for the six distinct components of an antisymmetric tensor. Starting with ¯t 01,wehave ¯t 01 = \u000b 0 λ\u000b 1 σ t λσ , but according to Eq. 12.114, \u000b 0 λ = 0 unless λ = 0 or 1, and \u000b 1 σ = 0 unless σ = 0 or 1. So there are four terms in the sum: ¯t 01 = \u000b 0 0\u000b 1 0t 00 + \u000b 0 0\u000b 1 1t 01 + \u000b 0 1\u000b 1 0t 10 + \u000b 0 1\u000b 1 1t 11. 564 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity On the other hand, t 00 = t 11 = 0, while t 01 =−t 10,so ¯t 01 = (\u000b 0 0\u000b 1 1 − \u000b 0 1\u000b 1 0)t 01 = (γ 2 − (γβ)2)t 01 = t 01. I’ll let you work out the others—the complete set of transformation rules is ¯t 01 = t 01, ¯t 02 = γ(t 02 − βt 12), ¯t 03 = γ(t 03 + βt 31), ¯t 23 = t 23, ¯t 31 = γ(t 31 + βt 03), ¯t 12 = γ(t 12 − βt 02). } (12.118) These are precisely the rules we obtained on physical grounds for the electromag- netic ﬁelds (Eq. 12.109)—in fact, we can construct the ﬁeld tensor F μν by direct comparison:25 F 01 ≡ Ex c , F 02 ≡ E y c , F 03 ≡ Ez c , F 12 ≡ Bz, F 31 ≡ By, F 23 ≡ Bx . Written as an array, F μν = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ 0 Ex /cE y/cEz/c −Ex /c 0 Bz −By −E y/c −Bz 0 Bx −Ez/cBy −Bx 0 ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ . (12.119) Thus relativity completes and perfects the job begun by Oersted, combining the electric and magnetic ﬁelds into a single entity, F μν. If you followed that argument with exquisite care, you may have noticed that there was a different way of imbedding E and B in an antisymmetric tensor: In- stead of comparing the ﬁrst line of Eq. 12.109 with the ﬁrst line of Eq. 12.118, and the second with the second, we could relate the ﬁrst line of Eq. 12.109 to the second line of Eq. 12.118, and vice versa. This leads to dual tensor, Gμν: Gμν = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ 0 Bx By Bz −Bx 0 −Ez/cE y/c −By Ez/c 0 −Ex /c −Bz −E y/cEx /c 0 ⎫ ⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ . (12.120) Gμν can be obtained directly from F μν by the substitution E/c → B, B → −E/c. Notice that this operation leaves Eq. 12.109 unchanged—that’s why both tensors generate the correct transformation rules for E and B. Problem 12.49 Work out the remaining ﬁve parts to Eq. 12.118. Problem 12.50 Prove that the symmetry (or antisymmetry) of a tensor is preserved by Lorentz transformation (that is: if t μν is symmetric, show that ¯t μν is also sym- metric, and likewise for antisymmetric). 25Some authors prefer the convention F 01 ≡ Ex , F 12 ≡ cBz, and so on, and some use the opposite signs. Accordingly, most of the equations from here on will look a little different, depending on the text. 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 565 Problem 12.51 Recall that a covariant 4-vector is obtained from a contravariant one by changing the sign of the zeroth component. The same goes for tensors: When you “lower an index” to make it covariant, you change the sign if that index is zero. Compute the tensor invariants F μν Fμν, Gμν Gμν, and F μν Gμν, in terms of E and B. Compare Prob. 12.47. Problem 12.52 A straight wire along the z axis carries a charge density λ traveling in the +z direction at speed v. Construct the ﬁeld tensor and the dual tensor at the point (x,0,0). 12.3.4 Electrodynamics in Tensor Notation Now that we know how to represent the ﬁelds in relativistic notation, it is time to reformulate the laws of electrodynamics (Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law) in that language. To begin with, we must determine how the sources of the ﬁelds, ρ and J, transform. Imagine a cloud of charge drifting by; we concen- trate on an inﬁnitesimal volume V , which contains charge Q moving at velocity u (Fig. 12.43). The charge density is ρ = Q V , and the current density26 is J = ρu. I would like to express these quantities in terms of the proper charge density ρ0, the density in the rest system of the charge: ρ0 = Q V0 , V Q u FIGURE 12.43 26I’m assuming all the charge in V is of one sign, and it all goes at the same speed. If not, you have to treat the constituents separately: J = ρ+u+ + ρ−u−. But the argument is the same. 566 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity where V0 is the rest volume of the cloud. Because one dimension (the one along the direction of motion) is Lorentz-contracted, V = √1 − u2/c2 V0, (12.121) and hence ρ = ρ0 1 √ 1 − u2/c2 , J = ρ0 u √ 1 − u2/c2 . (12.122) Comparing this with Eqs. 12.40 and 12.42, we recognize here the components of proper velocity, multiplied by the invariant ρ0. Evidently charge density and current density go together to make a 4-vector: J μ = ρ0ημ, (12.123) whose components are J μ = (cρ, Jx , Jy, Jz). (12.124) We’ll call it the current density 4-vector. The continuity equation (Eq. 5.29), ∇ · J =− ∂ρ ∂t , expressing the local conservation of charge, takes on a nice compact form when written in terms of J μ.For ∇ · J = ∂ Jx ∂ x + ∂ Jy ∂ y + ∂ Jz ∂z = 3∑ i=1 ∂ J i ∂ x i , while ∂ρ ∂t = 1 c ∂ J 0 ∂t = ∂ J 0 ∂ x 0 . (12.125) Thus, bringing ∂ρ/∂t over to the left side (in the continuity equation), we have: ∂ J μ ∂ x μ = 0, (12.126) with summation over μ implied. Incidentally, ∂ J μ/∂ x μ is the four-dimensional divergence of J μ, so the continuity equation states that the current density 4-vector is divergenceless. 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 567 As for Maxwell’s equations, they can be written ∂ F μν ∂ x ν = μ0 J μ, ∂Gμν ∂ x ν = 0, (12.127) with summation over ν implied. Each of these stands for four equations—one for every value of μ.If μ = 0, the ﬁrst equation reads ∂ F 0ν ∂ x ν = ∂ F 00 ∂ x 0 + ∂ F 01 ∂ x 1 + ∂ F 02 ∂ x 2 + ∂ F 03 ∂ x 3 = 1 c ( ∂ Ex ∂ x + ∂ E y ∂ y + ∂ Ez ∂z ) = 1 c (∇ · E) = μ0 J 0 = μ0cρ, or ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ. This, of course, is Gauss’s law. If μ = 1, we have ∂ F 1ν ∂ x ν = ∂ F 10 ∂ x 0 + ∂ F 11 ∂ x 1 + ∂ F 12 ∂ x 2 + ∂ F 13 ∂ x 3 =− 1 c2 ∂ Ex ∂t + ∂ Bz ∂ y − ∂ By ∂z = ( − 1 c2 ∂E ∂t + ∇ × B ) x = μ0 J 1 = μ0 Jx . Combining this with the corresponding results for μ = 2 and μ = 3gives ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t , which is Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s correction. Meanwhile, the second equation in 12.127, with μ = 0, becomes ∂G0ν ∂ x ν = ∂G00 ∂ x 0 + ∂G01 ∂ x 1 + ∂G02 ∂ x 2 + ∂G03 ∂ x 3 = ∂ Bx ∂ x + ∂ By ∂ y + ∂ Bz ∂z = ∇ · B = 0 568 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity (the third of Maxwell’s equations), whereas μ = 1 yields ∂G1ν ∂ x ν = ∂G10 ∂ x 0 + ∂G11 ∂ x 1 + ∂G12 ∂ x 2 + ∂G13 ∂ x 3 =− 1 c ∂ Bx ∂t − 1 c ∂ Ez ∂ y + 1 c ∂ E y ∂z =− 1 c ( ∂B ∂t + ∇ × E ) x = 0. So, combining this with the corresponding results for μ = 2 and μ = 3, ∇ × E =− ∂B ∂t , which is Faraday’s law. In relativistic notation, then, Maxwell’s four rather cum- bersome equations reduce to two delightfully simple ones. In terms of F μν and the proper velocity ημ, the Minkowski force on a charge q is given by K μ = qην F μν. (12.128) For if μ = 1, we have K 1 = qην F 1ν = q(−η0 F 10 + η1 F 11 + η2 F 12 + η3 F 13) = q [ −c √1 − u2/c2 ( −Ex c ) + u y √ 1 − u2/c2 (Bz) + uz √1 − u2/c2 (−By) ] = q √1 − u2/c2 [E + (u × B)]x , with a similar formula for μ = 2 and μ = 3. Thus, K = q √ 1 − u2/c2 [E + (u × B)], (12.129) and therefore, referring back to Eq. 12.69, F = q[E + (u × B)], which is the Lorentz force law. Equation 12.128, then, represents the Lorentz force law in relativistic notation. I’ll leave for you the interpretation of the zeroth component (Prob. 12.55). Problem 12.53 Obtain the continuity equation (Eq. 12.126) directly from Maxwell’s equations (Eq. 12.127). Problem 12.54 Show that the second equation in Eq. 12.127 can be expressed in terms of the ﬁeld tensor F μν as follows: ∂ Fμν ∂ x λ + ∂ Fνλ ∂ x μ + ∂ Fλμ ∂ x ν = 0. (12.130) 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 569 Problem 12.55 Work out, and interpret physically, the μ = 0 component of the electromagnetic force law, Eq. 12.128. 12.3.5 Relativistic Potentials From Chapter 10, we know that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be expressed in terms of a scalar potential V and a vector potential A: E =−∇V − ∂A ∂t , B = ∇ × A. (12.131) As you might guess, V and A together constitute a 4-vector: Aμ = (V /c, Ax , Ay, Az). (12.132) In terms of this 4-vector potential, the ﬁeld tensor can be written F μν = ∂ Aν ∂ xμ − ∂ Aμ ∂ xν . (12.133) (Observe that the differentiation is with respect to the covariant vectors xμ and xν; remember, that changes the sign of the zeroth component: x0 =−x 0. See Prob. 12.56.) To check that Eq. 12.133 is equivalent to Eq. 12.131, let’s evaluate a few terms explicitly. For μ = 0,ν = 1, F 01 = ∂ A1 ∂ x0 − ∂ A0 ∂ x1 =− ∂ Ax ∂(ct) − 1 c ∂ V ∂ x =− 1 c ( ∂A ∂t + ∇V ) x = Ex c . That (and its companions with ν = 2 and ν = 3) is the ﬁrst equation in Eq. 12.131. For μ = 1, ν = 2, we get F 12 = ∂ A2 ∂ x1 − ∂ A1 ∂ x2 = ∂ Ay ∂ x − ∂ Ax ∂ y = (∇ × A)z = Bz, which (together with the corresponding results for F 23 and F 31) is the second equation in Eq. 12.131. The potential formulation automatically takes care of the homogeneous Max- well equation (∂Gμν/∂ x ν = 0). As for the inhomogeneous equation (∂ F μν/∂ x ν = μ0 J μ), that becomes ∂ ∂ xμ ( ∂ Aν ∂ x ν ) − ∂ ∂ xν ( ∂ Aμ ∂ x ν ) = μ0 J μ. (12.134) 570 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity This is an intractable equation as it stands. However, you will recall that the poten- tials are not uniquely determined by the ﬁelds—in fact, it’s clear from Eq. 12.133 that you could add to Aμ the gradient of any scalar function λ: Aμ −→ Aμ[ = Aμ + ∂λ ∂ xμ , (12.135) without changing F μν. This is precisely the gauge invariance we noted in Chapter 10; we can exploit it to simplify Eq. 12.134. In particular, the Lorenz gauge condition (Eq. 10.12) ∇ · A =− 1 c2 ∂ V ∂t becomes, in relativistic notation, ∂ Aμ ∂ x μ = 0. (12.136) In the Lorenz gauge, therefore, Eq. 12.134 reduces to □ 2 Aμ =−μ0 J μ, (12.137) where □ 2 is the d’Alembertian, □ 2 ≡ ∂ ∂ xν ∂ ∂ x ν =∇2 − 1 c2 ∂ 2 ∂t 2 . (12.138) Equation 12.137 combines our previous results into a single 4-vector equation—it represents the most elegant formulation of Maxwell’s equations. 27 Problem 12.56 You may have noticed that the four-dimensional gradient operator ∂/∂ x μ functions like a covariant 4-vector—in fact, it is often written ∂μ, for short. For instance, the continuity equation, ∂μ J μ = 0, has the form of an invariant product of two vectors. The corresponding contravariant gradient would be ∂ μ ≡ ∂/∂ xμ. Prove that ∂ μφ is a (contravariant) 4-vector, if φ is a scalar function, by working out its transformation law, using the chain rule. Problem 12.57 Show that the potential representation (Eq. 12.133) automatically satisﬁes ∂Gμν/∂ x ν = 0. [Suggestion: Use Prob. 12.54.] Problem 12.58 Show that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (Eqs. 10.46 and 10.47) can be expressed in relativistic notation as Aμ =− q 4πϵ0c ημ (ηνrν) , where r μ ≡ x μ − wμ(tr ). 27Incidentally, the Coulomb gauge is bad, from the point of view of relativity, because its deﬁning condition, ∇ · A = 0, is destroyed by Lorentz transformation. To restore this condition, it is necessary to perform an appropriate gauge transformation every time you go to a new inertial system, in addition to the Lorentz transformation itself. In this sense, Aμ is not a true 4-vector, in the Coulomb gauge. 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 571 More Problems on Chapter 12 Problem 12.59 Inertial system ¯S moves at constant velocity v = βc(cos φ ˆx + sin φ ˆy) with respect to S.

APPENDIX A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates A.1 INTRODUCTION In this Appendix I sketch proofs of the three fundamental theorems of vector calculus. My aim is to convey the essence of the argument, not to track down every epsilon and delta. A much more elegant, modern, and uniﬁed—but necessarily also much longer—treatment will be found in M. Spivak’s book, Calculus on Manifolds (New York: Benjamin, 1965). For the sake of generality, I shall use arbitrary (orthogonal) curvilinear co- ordinates (u,v,w), developing formulas for the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian in any such system. You can then specialize them to Cartesian, spheri- cal, or cylindrical coordinates, or any other system you might wish to use. If the generality bothers you on a ﬁrst reading, and you’d rather stick to Cartesian co- ordinates, just read (x, y, z) wherever you see (u,v,w), and make the associated simpliﬁcations as you go along. A.2 NOTATION We identify a point in space by its three coordinates, u,v, and w (in the Carte- sian system, (x, y, z); in the spherical system, (r,θ,φ); in the cylindrical system, (s,φ, z)). I shall assume the system is orthogonal, in the sense that the three unit vectors, ˆu, ˆv, and ˆw, pointing in the direction of the increase of the corresponding coordinates, are mutually perpendicular. Note that the unit vectors are functions of position, since their directions (except in the Cartesian case) vary from point to point. Any vector can be expressed in terms of ˆu, ˆv, and ˆw—in particular, the in- ﬁnitesimal displacement vector from (u,v,w)to(u + du,v + dv, w + dw) can be written dl = fdu ˆu + gdv ˆv + hdw ˆw, (A.1) where f , g, and h are functions of position characteristic of the particular coor- dinate system (in Cartesian coordinates f = g = h = 1; in spherical coordinates f = 1, g = r , h = r sin θ ; and in cylindrical coordinates f = h = 1, g = s). As you’ll soon see, these three functions tell you everything you need to know about a coordinate system. 575 576 Appendix A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates a b dl FIGURE A.1 A.3 GRADIENT If you move from point (u,v,w) to point (u + du,v + dv, w + dw), a scalar function t (u,v,w) changes by an amount dt = ∂t ∂u du + ∂t ∂v dv + ∂t ∂w dw; (A.2) this is a standard theorem on partial differentiation. 1 We can write it as a dot product, dt = ∇t · dl = (∇t)u fdu + (∇t)v gdv + (∇t)w hdw, (A.3) provided we deﬁne (∇t)u ≡ 1 f ∂t ∂u ,(∇t)v ≡ 1 g ∂t ∂v ,(∇t)w ≡ 1 h ∂t ∂w . The gradient of t, then, is ∇t ≡ 1 f ∂t ∂u ˆu + 1 g ∂t ∂v ˆv + 1 h ∂t ∂w ˆw. (A.4) If you now pick the appropriate expressions for f, g, and h from Table A.1, you can easily generate the formulas for ∇t in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, as they appear inside the front cover of the book.

Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 2nd ed., Chapter 4, Sect. 3 (New York: John Wiley, 1983). A.4 Divergence 577 From Eq. A.3 it follows that the total change in t, as you go from point a to point b (Fig. A.1), is t (b) − t (a) = √ b a dt = √ b a (∇t) · dl, (A.5) which is the fundamental theorem for gradients (not much to prove, really, in this case). Notice that the integral is independent of the path taken from a to b. A.4 DIVERGENCE Suppose that we have a vector function, A(u,v,w) = Au ˆu + Av ˆv + Aw ˆw, and we wish to evaluate the integral ∮ A · da over the surface of the inﬁnitesi- mal volume generated by starting at the point (u,v,w) and increasing each of the coordinates in succession by an inﬁnitesimal amount (Fig. A.2). Because the coordinates are orthogonal, this is (at least, in the inﬁnitesimal limit) a rectangu- lar solid, whose sides have lengths dlu = fdu, dlv = gdv, and dlw = hdw, and whose volume is therefore dτ = dlu dlv dlw = ( fgh) du dv dw. (A.6) (The sides are not just du, dv, dw—after all, v might be an angle, in which case dv doesn’t even have the dimensions of length. The correct expressions follow from Eq. A.1.) For the front surface, da =−(gh) dv dw ˆu, so that A · da =−(gh Au) dv dw. The back surface is identical (except for the sign), only this time the quantity gh Au is to be evaluated at (u + du), instead of u. Since for any (differentiable) function F(u), F(u + du) − F(u) = dF du du, (in the limit), the front and back together amount to a contribution [ ∂ ∂u (gh Au)] du dv dw = 1 fgh ∂ ∂u (gh Au) dτ. By the same token, the right and left sides yield 1 fgh ∂ ∂v ( fh Av) dτ, 578 Appendix A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates w u (u, v, w + dw) h dwf dug dv (u, v, w) (u, v + dv, w) (u + du, v + dv, w) (u, v + dv, w + dw) (u + du, v + dv, w + dw) v (u + du, v, w) FIGURE A.2 and the top and bottom give 1 fgh ∂ ∂w ( fg Aw) dτ. All told, then, ∮ A · da = 1 fgh [ ∂ ∂u (gh Au) + ∂ ∂v ( fh Av) + ∂ ∂w ( fg Aw)] dτ. (A.7) The coefﬁcient of dτ serves to deﬁne the divergence of A in curvilinear coordi- nates: ∇ · A ≡ 1 fgh [ ∂ ∂u (gh Au) + ∂ ∂v ( fh Av) + ∂ ∂w ( fg Aw)] , (A.8) and Eq. A.7 becomes ∮ A · da = (∇ · A) dτ. (A.9) Using Table A.1, you can now derive the formulas for the divergence in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, which appear in the front cover of the book. A.5 Curl 579 FIGURE A.3 As it stands, Eq. A.9 does not prove the divergence theorem, for it pertains only to inﬁnitesimal volumes, and rather special inﬁnitesimal volumes at that. Of course, a ﬁnite volume can be broken up into inﬁnitesimal pieces, and Eq. A.9 can be applied to each one. The trouble is, when you then add up all the bits, the left-hand side is not just an integral over the outer surface, but over all those tiny internal surfaces as well. Luckily, however, these contributions cancel in pairs, for each internal surface occurs as the boundary of two adjacent inﬁnitesimal vol- umes, and since da always points outward, A · da has the opposite sign for the two members of each pair (Fig. A.3). Only those surfaces that bound a single chunk—which is to say, only those at the outer boundary—survive when every- thing is added up. For ﬁnite regions, then, ∮ A · da = √ (∇ · A) dτ, (A.10) and you need integrate only over the external surface. 2 This establishes the diver- gence theorem. A.5 CURL To obtain the curl in curvilinear coordinates, we calculate the line integral, ∮ A · dl, around the inﬁnitesimal loop generated by starting at (u,v,w) and successively increasing u and v by inﬁnitesimal amounts, holding w constant (Fig. A.4). The surface is a rectangle (at least, in the inﬁnitesimal limit), of length dlu = fdu, width dlv = gdv, and area da = ( fg)du dv ˆw. (A.11) 2What about regions that cannot be ﬁt perfectly by rectangular solids no matter how tiny they are— such as planes cut at an angle to the coordinate lines? It’s not hard to dispose of this case; try thinking it out for yourself, or look at H. M. Schey’s Div, Grad, Curl and All That (New York: W. W. Norton, 1973), starting with Prob. II-15. 580 Appendix A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates (u + du, v + dv, w)(u, v + dv, w) (u, v, w) (u + du, v, w) g dv f du u v FIGURE A.4 Assuming the coordinate system is right-handed, ˆw points out of the page in Fig. A.4. Having chosen this as the positive direction for da, we are obliged by the right-hand rule to run the line integral counterclockwise, as shown. Along the bottom segment, dl = fdu ˆu, so A · dl = ( fAu) du. Along the top leg, the sign is reversed, and fAu is evaluated at (v + dv) rather than v. Taken together, these two edges give [−( fAu)∣ ∣ v+dv + ( fAu)∣ ∣v] du =− [ ∂ ∂v ( fAu)] du dv. Similarly, the right and left sides yield [ ∂ ∂u (gAv)] du dv, so the total is ∮ A · dl = [ ∂ ∂u (gAv) − ∂ ∂v ( fAu)] du dv = 1 fg [ ∂ ∂u (gAv) − ∂ ∂v ( fAu)] ˆw · da. (A.12) The coefﬁcient of da on the right serves to deﬁne the w-component of the curl. Constructing the u and v components in the same way, we have ∇ × A ≡ 1 gh [ ∂ ∂v (hAw) − ∂ ∂w (gAv)] ˆu + 1 fh [ ∂ ∂w ( fAu) − ∂ ∂u (hAw)] ˆv + 1 fg [ ∂ ∂u (gAv) − ∂ ∂v ( fAu)] ˆw, (A.13) A.6 Laplacian 581 FIGURE A.5 and Eq. A.11 generalizes to ∮ A · dl = (∇ × A) · da. (A.14) Using Table A.1, you can now derive the formulas for the curl in Cartesian, spher- ical, and cylindrical coordinates. Equation A.14 does not by itself prove Stokes’ theorem, however, because at this point it pertains only to very special inﬁnitesimal surfaces. Again, we can chop any ﬁnite surface into inﬁnitesimal pieces and apply Eq. A.14 to each one (Fig. A.5). When we add them up, though, we obtain (on the left) not only a line integral around the outer boundary, but a lot of tiny line integrals around the internal loops as well. Fortunately, as before, the internal contributions cancel in pairs, because every internal line is the edge of two adjacent loops running in opposite directions. Consequently, Eq. A.14 can be extended to ﬁnite surfaces, ∮ A · dl = √ (∇ × A) · da, (A.15) and the line integral is to be taken over the external boundary only.3 This estab- lishes Stokes’ theorem. A.6 LAPLACIAN Since the Laplacian of a scalar is by deﬁnition the divergence of the gradient, we can read off from Eqs. A.4 and A.8 the general formula ∇2t ≡ 1 fgh [ ∂ ∂u ( gh f ∂t ∂u ) + ∂ ∂v ( fh g ∂t ∂v ) + ∂ ∂w ( fg h ∂t ∂w )] . (A.16) Once again, you are invited to use Table A.1 to derive the Laplacian in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, and thus to conﬁrm the formulas inside the front cover. 3What about surfaces that cannot be ﬁt perfectly by tiny rectangles, no matter how small they are (such as triangles) or surfaces that do not correspond to holding one coordinate ﬁxed? If such cases trouble you, and you cannot resolve them for yourself, look at H. M. Schey’s Div, Grad, Curl, and All That, Prob. III-2 (New York: W. W. Norton, 1973). APPENDIX B The Helmholtz Theorem Suppose we are told that the divergence of a vector function F(r) is a speciﬁed scalar function D(r): ∇ · F = D, (B.1) and the curl of F(r) is a speciﬁed vector function C(r): ∇ × F = C. (B.2) For consistency, C must be divergenceless, ∇ · C = 0, (B.3) because the divergence of a curl is always zero. Question: can we, on the basis of this information, determine the function F?If D(r) and C(r) go to zero sufﬁ- ciently rapidly at inﬁnity, the answer is yes, as I will show by explicit construction. I claim that F =−∇U + ∇ × W, (B.4) where U (r) ≡ 1 4π √ D(r ˙) r dτ ˙ (B.5) and W(r) ≡ 1 4π √ C(r ˙) r dτ ˙; (B.6) the integrals are over all of space, and, as always, r =|r − r ˙|.For if F is given by Eq. B.4, then its divergence (using Eq. 1.102) is ∇ · F =−∇2U =− 1 4π √ D ∇2 ( 1 r ) dτ ˙ = √ D(r ˙)δ3(r − r ˙) dτ ˙ = D(r). (Remember that the divergence of a curl is zero, so the W term drops out, and note that the differentiation is with respect to r, which is contained in r.) So the divergence is right; how about the curl? ∇ × F = ∇ × (∇ × W) =−∇2W + ∇(∇ · W). (B.7) 582 Appendix B The Helmholtz Theorem 583 (Since the curl of a gradient is zero, the U term drops out.) Now −∇2W =− 1 4π √ C ∇2 ( 1 r ) dτ ˙ = √ C(r ˙)δ3(r − r ˙) dτ ˙ = C(r), which is perfect—I’ll be done if I can just persuade you that the second term on the right side of Eq. B.7 vanishes. Using integration by parts (Eq. 1.59), and noting that derivatives of r with respect to primed coordinates differ by a sign from those with respect to unprimed coordinates, we have 4π ∇ · W = √ C · ∇ ( 1 r ) dτ ˙ =− √ C · ∇˙ ( 1 r ) dτ ˙ = √ 1 r ∇˙ · C dτ − ∮ 1 r C · da. (B.8) But the divergence of C is zero, by assumption (Eq. B.3), and the surface integral (way out at inﬁnity) will vanish, as long as C goes to zero sufﬁciently rapidly. Of course, that proof tacitly assumes that the integrals in Eqs. B.5 and B.6 converge—otherwise U and W don’t exist at all. At the large r ˙ limit, where r ≈ r ˙, the integrals have the form √ ∞ X (r ˙) r ˙ r ˙2 dr ˙ = √ ∞ r ˙ X (r ˙) dr ˙. (B.9) (Here X stands for D or C, as the case may be). Obviously, X (r ˙) must go to zero at large r ˙—but that’s not enough: if X ∼ 1/r ˙, the integrand is constant, so the integral blows up, and even if X ∼ 1/r ˙2, the integral is a logarithm, which is still no good at r ˙ →∞. Evidently the divergence and curl of F must go to zero more rapidly than 1/r 2 for the proof to hold. (Incidentally, this is more than enough to ensure that the surface integral in Eq. B.8 vanishes.) Now, assuming these conditions on D(r) and C(r) are met, is the solution in Eq. B.4 unique? The answer is clearly no, for we can add to F any vector function whose divergence and curl both vanish, and the result still has divergence D and curl C. However, it so happens that there is no function that has zero divergence and zero curl everywhere and goes to zero at inﬁnity (see Sect. 3.1.5). So if we include a requirement that F(r) goes to zero as r →∞, then solution B.4 is unique.1 Now that all the cards are on the table, I can state the Helmholtz theorem more rigorously: If the divergence D(r) and the curl C(r) of a vector function F(r) are spec- iﬁed, and if they both go to zero faster than 1/r 2 as r →∞, and if F(r) goes to zero as r →∞, then F is given uniquely by Eq. B.4. 1Typically we do expect the electric and magnetic ﬁelds to go to zero at large distances from the charges and currents that produce them, so this is not an unreasonable stipulation. Occasionally one encounters artiﬁcial problems in which the charge or current distribution itself extends to inﬁnity— inﬁnite wires, for instance, or inﬁnite planes. In such cases, other means must be found to establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Maxwell’s equations. 584 Appendix B The Helmholtz Theorem The Helmholtz theorem has an interesting corollary: Any (differentiable) vector function F(r) that goes to zero faster than 1/r as r →∞ can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar plus the curl of a vector: 2 F(r) = ∇ ( −1 4π √ ∇˙ · F(r ˙) r dτ ˙) + ∇×( 1 4π √ ∇˙ × F(r ˙) r dτ ˙) . (B.10) For example, in electrostatics ∇ · E = ρ/<0 and ∇ × E = 0,so E(r) =−∇ ( 1 4π<0 √ ρ(r ˙) r dτ ˙) =−∇V (B.11) (where V is the scalar potential), while in magnetostatics ∇ · B = 0 and ∇ × B = μ0J,so B(r) = ∇ × ( μ0 4π √ J(r ˙) r dτ ˙) = ∇ × A (B.12) (where A is the vector potential). 2As a matter of fact, any differentiable vector function whatever (regardless of its behavior at inﬁnity) can be written as a gradient plus a curl, but this more general result does not follow directly from the Helmholtz theorem, nor does Eq. B.10 supply the explicit construction, since the integrals, in general, diverge. APPENDIX C Units In our units (the Système International), Coulomb’s law reads F = 1 4πϵ0 q1q2 r2 ˆr (SI). (C.1) Mechanical quantities are measured in meters, kilograms, seconds, and charge is in coulombs (Table C.1). In the Gaussian system, the constant in front is, in effect, absorbed into the unit of charge, so that F = q1q2 r2 ˆr (Gaussian). (C.2) Mechanical quantities are measured in centimeters, grams, seconds, and charge is in electrostatic units (or esu). For what it’s worth, an esu is a (dyne) 1/2-centimeter.

[Note: Except in exponents, every “3” is short for α ≡ 2.99792458 (the numerical value of the speed of light), “9” means α2, and “12” is 4α.] 585 586 Appendix C Units Converting electrostatic equations from SI to Gaussian units is not difﬁcult: just set ϵ0 → 1 4π . For example, the energy stored in an electric ﬁeld (Eq. 2.45), U = ϵ0 2 √ E 2 dτ(SI), becomes U = 1 8π √ E 2 dτ(Gaussian). (Formulas pertaining to ﬁelds inside dielectrics are not so easy to translate, because of differing deﬁnitions of displacement, susceptibility, and so on; see Table C.2.) The Biot-Savart law, which for us reads B = μ0 4π I √ dl × ˆr r2 (SI), (C.3) becomes, in the Gaussian system, B = I c √ dl × ˆr r2 (Gaussian), (C.4) where c is the speed of light, and current is measured in esu/s. The Gaussian unit of magnetic ﬁeld (the gauss) is the one quantity from this system in everyday use: people speak of volts, amperes, henries, and so on (all SI units), but for some rea- son they tend to measure magnetic ﬁelds in gauss (the Gaussian unit); the correct SI unit is the tesla (10 4 gauss). One major virtue of the Gaussian system is that electric and magnetic ﬁelds have the same dimensions (in principle, one could measure the electric ﬁelds in gauss too, though no one uses the term in this context). Thus the Lorentz force law, which we have written F = q(E + v × B)(SI), (C.5) (indicating that E/B has the dimensions of velocity), takes the form F = q (E + v c × B ) (Gaussian). (C.6) In effect, the magnetic ﬁeld is “scaled up” by a factor of c. This reveals more starkly the parallel structure of electricity and magnetism. For instance, the total energy stored in electromagnetic ﬁelds is U = 1 8π √ (E 2 + B2) dτ(Gaussian), (C.7) Appendix C Units 587 eliminating the ϵ0 and μ0 that spoil the symmetry in the SI formula, U = 1 2 √ ( ϵ0 E 2 + 1 μ0 B2) dτ(SI).
