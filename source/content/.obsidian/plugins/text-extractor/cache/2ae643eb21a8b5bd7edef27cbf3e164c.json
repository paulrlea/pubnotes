The even series starts with 𝑎0. Letting 2𝑏 = 𝛽 we now have: 𝑅𝑙(𝑟) = 𝑟𝑙 ෍ 𝑏=0 ∞ 𝑎2𝑏𝑟2𝑏 with 𝑎2(𝑏+1) = 𝑘2 4 𝑙 + 𝑏 + 3 2 𝑏 + 1 𝑎2𝑏 which can be recognized as the series for spherical Bessel functions: 𝑗𝑙(𝑧) Spherical Well 8 SISW: any l solutions 𝑢(𝑟) = ෍ 𝑛=0 ∞ 𝑎𝑛𝑟𝑛 2+𝑙 𝑅𝑙(𝑟) = 𝑁𝑗𝑙(𝑟) 𝑗𝑙(𝑧) ≡ 𝜋 2𝑧 𝐽𝑙+1/2(𝑧) The other independent solution leads to terms that blow up at r=0 and is therefore unphysical. 𝐽𝑙+1/2(𝑧) is the regular Bessel function of half order. Spherical Well 9 Spherical Bessel functions The series for spherical Bessel functions looks complicated but it simplifies to well known functions: 𝑗0(𝑧) = sin 𝑧 𝑧 𝑗1(𝑧) = sin 𝑧 𝑧2 − cos 𝑧 𝑧 𝑗2(𝑧) = 3 𝑧3 − 1 𝑧 sin 𝑧 − 3 𝑧2 cos 𝑧 Spherical Well 10 SISW: general solution Solutions to the infinite well require that 𝑗𝑙(𝑘𝑎) = 0 so for each 𝑙 we have many possible solutions for 𝑘 which we will label 𝑛𝑟. 𝜓𝑛𝑟𝑙𝑚𝑙(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝜑) = 2 𝑗𝑙+1 𝑘𝑛𝑟𝑎 𝑗𝑙 𝑘𝑛𝑟𝑟 𝑌𝑙𝑚(𝜃, 𝜑) where the 𝑘𝑛𝑟are the zeroes of 𝑗𝑙(𝑘𝑛𝑟𝑎) Spherical Well 11 SISW: solutions The red line above is the effective potential due to the non- zero angular momentum term. 𝜓𝑛𝑟𝑙 Spherical Well 12 SISW: solutions l nr knra 0 0  1 0 4.5 2 0 5.8 0 1 2 3 0 7 1 1 7.7 • Here is a table of roots of spherical Bessel functions. • Note that the l=0 solutions are multiples of , as you expect for the sine function.

We now search for solutions to the full equation using the polynomial expansion approach. The lowest order polynomial with the right behavior as 𝜌 → 0 is 𝑢(𝜌) = 𝑟𝑒− 𝜀𝜌. (Think about the number of roots for a polynomial.)

If we want the probability of finding the electron at a distance between r and r+dr from the nucleus, then we have to integrate Ψ∗Ψ around the sphere. 𝑤(𝜌) = න 0 2𝜋 න 0 𝜋 𝑟2 sin 𝜃 𝑅2(𝜌) 𝑌𝑙𝑚 ∗ 𝜃, 𝜑 𝑌𝑙𝑚 𝜃, 𝜑 𝑑𝜃𝑑𝜑 For l=0, 𝑤(𝜌) = 4𝜋𝑟2𝑅2 = 4𝜋𝑢2 Radial Probability Density≡ Ψ∗Ψ4𝜋𝑟2 Spherical Well 21 Radial probability density for l=0 solutions w1 w2 w3 Spherical Well 22 Information from the radial probability density – most likely distance At what distance is the electron most likely to be found?

If we plug this guess back into the full equation, we get 𝜀 = − 1 (𝑙 + 1)2 . The energy solution we have found corresponds to the 𝑙=0 solution for 𝑛 = 𝑙 + 1.
