Bertrand Competition. Fall 2024 2 Bertrand Price Competition • In many markets firms compete by directly setting prices • The basic model and concepts are presented here. We will discuss examples and relevance to specific biopharmaceuticals and healthcare markets in class Vivek Ghosal. Bertrand Competition. Fall 2024 3 Bertrand Price Competition Let: QNB = 63.42 - 3.98PNB + 2.25PSB QSB = 49.52 - 5.48PSB + 1.40PNB MCNB = $4.96 per box MCSB = $3.96 per box Name brand (NB) and store brand (SB) Loratadine Consumer views them as differentiated products Illustrative demand functions, and costs Vivek Ghosal. Bertrand Competition. Fall 2024 4 Bertrand Price Competition Method: Using Profit Functions Profit of NB: NB = (PNB - 4.96)(63.42 - 3.98PNB + 2.25PSB) Profit of SB: SB = (PSB - 3.96)(49.52 - 5.48PSB + 1.40PNB) Differentiate with respect to PNB and PSB respectively Solving for equilibrium prices Vivek Ghosal. Bertrand Competition. Fall 2024 5 Bertrand Price Competition Solving gives the price-response functions: PNB = 10.44 + 0.2826PSB PSB = 6.49 + 0.1277PNB PNB PSB RNB $10.44 RSB Upward sloping price-response functions: RNB and RSB Equilibrium point B $12.72 $8.11 $6.49 Solve above 2 equations for equilibrium prices In equilibrium: P>MC Firms earn economic rents","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
