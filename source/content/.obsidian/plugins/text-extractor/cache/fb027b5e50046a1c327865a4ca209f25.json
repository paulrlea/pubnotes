Supply, Demand, and Trade in a Single Industry (1 of 4) • Consider how a tariff affects a single market, say that of wheat. • Suppose that in the absence of trade the price of wheat is higher in Home than it is in Foreign. • With trade, wheat will be shipped from Foreign to Home until the price difference is eliminated. Supply, Demand, and Trade in a Single Industry (2 of 4) • An import demand curve is the difference between the quantity that Home consumers demand minus the quantity that Home producers supply, at each price. • The Home import demand curve MD = D − S intercepts the price axis at PA and is downward sloping: – As price increases, the quantity of imports demanded declines. Deriving Home’s Import Demand Curve Supply, Demand, and Trade in a Single Industry (3 of 4) • An export supply curve is the difference between the quantity that Foreign producers supply minus the quantity that Foreign consumers demand, at each price. • The Foreign export supply curve   =−XS S D intersects the price axis at  AP and is upward sloping: – As price increases, the quantity of exports supplied rises. Deriving Foreign’s Export Supply Curve Supply, Demand, and Trade in a Single Industry (4 of 4) • In equilibrium, import demand = export supply, home demand − home supply = foreign supply − foreign demand, home demand + foreign demand = home supply + foreign supply, world demand = world supply. World EquilibriumEffects of a Tariff (1 of 4) • A tariff acts like a transportation cost, making sellers unwilling to ship goods unless the Home price exceeds the Foreign price by the amount of the tariff: −=TTP t P • A tariff makes the price rise in the Home market and fall in the Foreign market. Effects of a TariffEffects of a Tariff (2 of 4) • Because the price in the Home market rises from PW under free trade to PT with the tariff, – Home producers supply more and Home consumers demand less, so – the quantity of imports falls from QW under free trade to QT with the tariff. Effects of a Tariff (3 of 4) • Because the price in the Foreign market falls from PW under free trade to  TP with the tariff, – Foreign producers supply less, and Foreign consumers demand more, so – the quantity of exports falls from QW to QT . The U.S. Agricultural Exports to China, 2014 to 2018 After the imposition of tariffs on U.S. imports, U.S. agricultural exports to China experienced a 53% decline from $19.5 billion in 2017 to $9.2 billion in 2018. Effects of a Tariff (4 of 4) • The quantity of Home imports demanded equals the quantity of Foreign exports supplied when −=TTP P t • The increase in the price in Home can be less than the amount of the tariff. – Part of the effect of the tariff causes the Foreign export price to decline. – But this effect is sometimes very small. Effects of a Tariff in a Small Country • When a country is “small,” it has no effect on the foreign (world) price because its demand is an insignificant part of world demand for the good. – The foreign price does not fall, but remains at Pw . – The price in the home market rises by the full amount of the tariff, to PT = Pw + t .
