Lienhard-Wiechert Potentials & Radiation Fields of Moving Electric Charges Radiation from moving electric charges is important because it is exploited to engineer sources of electromagnetic radiation with well- defined properties for the common purpose of life and research application. • Generation of electric charges: Photoemission, Thermoemission • Motion of electric charges: Acceleration by a bias voltage • Frequency and power of the electromagnetic radiation controlled by amount of charge, type of acceleration (linear vs. centripetal) and speed of the charge (bias voltage controlled). Electric potential of point charge at origin r=0 Electric potential of point charge not at origin but at position r’ Moving (point) charges and coordinate systems Recall problem 10.16 velocity field radiation field Description of E if origin of the coordinate system is not at position of point charge q. Next, the power radiated by the moving charge is calculated. This involves integration of the magnitude of the Poynting vector over a spherical surface. Mathematically this integration is the easiest if the origin of the coordinate system is a the position of the moving charge. Moving charge Velocity (Coulomb field) of the moving charge Power radiated away Accelerating electric charges to very high speed requires tremendous amounts of energy because the accelerating charge continuously loses energy in the form of radiation. From practical point of view, this makes it impossible to accelerate charges up to the value of the speed of light.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
