Problem 1 A 2D perovskite is formed with alternating layers of inorganic lead iodide octahedra and organic spacer cations. The thickness of each inorganic layer is 0.6 nm, and the thickness of each organic layer is 1.2 nm. a) Calculate the effective band gap of the 2D perovskite, assuming that the band gap of the bulk lead iodide perovskite is 1.5 eV and that quantum confinement effects lead to a band gap increase inversely proportional to the square of the inorganic layer thickness. [3] b) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using 2D perovskites in solar cells compared to 3D perovskites. [4] Problem 2 a) Explain what is ion intermixing, giving advantages of this method over the conventional perovskite structure. [2] b) Analyse the composition of the perovskite given by the formula: (F A0.83M A0.17)0.95Cs0.05P b(I0.83Br0.17)3 . i) List all the components, clearly labelling their function in the perovskite structure (A, B, X, etc.) [3] ii) For each component, give a rationale for using it in the material. [3] iii) Estimate qualitatively the difference between the original material and: i. (F A0.83M A0.17)0.95Cs0.05P bI3 [1] ii. M A0.95Cs0.05P b(I0.83Br0.17)3 [1] iii. F A0.83M A0.17P b(I0.83Br0.17)3 [1] iv) Calculate the correct values of x, y and z in the perovskite formulae below. i. La(AlxM g0.5T a0.25)O3 [1] ii.

In particular, outline the difference in: (a) nature of charge carriers and their main properties [2] (b) importance of polarons for optoelectronic applications in both materials [2] Problem 4 a) Briefly explain the importance of surface plasmon polaritons in nanomaterials applicati- ons. [2] b) A silver nanostructure embedded in air (ϵair = 1) is illuminated by a He-Ne laser (λ0 = 632.8 nm). At this wavelength, silver has permittivity ϵm = −15.88. Calculate the effective wavelength of surface plasmon polaritons in this nanostructure. [2] c) A nanometer-sized optical cavity is formed by creating a thin layer of SiO2 sandwiched between Au claddings. A red light (λ = 651 nm in vacuum) is confined in the cavity as a surface plasmon polariton with a wavelength of λef f = 51 nm. i calculate the effective refractive index of the cavity. [2] ii comment on viability of obtaining such refractive index in bulk materials. [1] iii Suggest two ways the cavity in the previous question could be applied outside of the lab.
