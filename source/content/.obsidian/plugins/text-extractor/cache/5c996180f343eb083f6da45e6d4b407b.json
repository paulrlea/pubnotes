Calculate the energy of the ground and first excited states for the potential, 洧녤(洧논) = 1 2 洧랪2洧논4, with 洧랪 = 0.0005 (in atomic units). 2) Determine a reasonable interval for your x-domain over which to solve for 풛(洧논). For instance, doubling the 洧논-domain should lead to only a minimal change in the calculated ground state energy (< 0.01%). 3) Plot the eigenfunctions of the grounds and first excited states.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
