Consider the example of N exponentially distributed random variables. Let ∑ = = N i ixy 1 , where ix are independent exponentially distributed random variables, i.e., all ix has the same exponential probability density: 0 0 0 )( < ≥    = − x x if ifae xp ax .

(b) Find the generating function iky N ek =Φ )( , for the sum of N independent exponentially distributed random variables. (c) Use your mathematical skills to inverse Fourier transform )(kNΦ and obtain )( yp N , the exact probability density function for y . (d) What you found in (c) is obviously not a Gaussian. How can we to reconcile it with the CLT? Write )( yp N as )()( yf N aeyp = and expand )( yf about its maximum oy (show that aNyo /)1( −= ). You will also encounter )!1( −N on the way so use Stirling’s approximation to deal with it. Show that in the asymptotic large N limit, )( yp N converges to a Gaussian with mean aN / and variance 2/ aN . Note that a/1 and 2/1 a are the mean x and the variance 2 xσ of the individual exponential random variables, respectively. This example illustrates how the CLT works: the variable xN xNy σ − will converge to a Gaussian variable with zero mean and unit variance in the ∞→N limit. 2. Consider the microcanonical ensemble of N independent classical (one-dimensional) oscillators with the same frequency ω . Note that the oscillators are localized, hence distinguishable by construction. (a) Find the number of microstates between E and EE δ+ , ),( EE δΩ .

The number of states in classical N-particle systems with energy less than E can be typically written as cN N EAE =Ω < )( , where NA is an N-dependent prefactor, while c is an N-independent constant. Using the notations from class, show that in the asymptotic large-N limit, the following three expressions become approximately equal (to leading order in N): ))(ln()),(ln())(ln( EgEEE ≈Ω≈Ω < δ . (Thus, in the microcanonical ensemble, we can use any of the above measures to obtain the entropy.) 4. The dependence of the Hamiltonian of a classical system on a particular generalized coordinate q is given by 2qα+′=HH , were H ′ may depend on all other coordinates and momenta, but not q .
