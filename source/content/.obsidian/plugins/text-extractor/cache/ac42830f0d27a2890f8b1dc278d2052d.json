They act as though they are repelling one another, even though there is no force between them. Ψ𝑠 = 1 2 𝜓𝐴(𝑥1)𝜓𝐵(𝑥2) + 𝜓𝐴(𝑥2)𝜓𝐵(𝑥1) In the symmetric state, P(x1,x2) is a maximum when the particles are close together. They act as though they are attracted to one another even though there is no force between them.

Possible combinations are, ↑ (1) ↑ (2) ↑ (1) ↓ (2) ↓ (1) ↑ (2) ↓ (1) ↓ (2) The first and last are symmetric wrt exchange. Second and third can be combined to make Symmetric: 1 2 ↑ (1) ↓ (2) +↑ (2) ↓ (1) Antisymmetric: 1 2 ↑ (1) ↓ (2) −↑ (2) ↓ (1) 14 Symmetric (Triplet) 𝛼(1)𝛼(2) (up,up S𝑧=+1) 1 2 𝛼(1)𝛽(2) + 𝛼(2)𝛽(1) (S𝑧=0) 𝛽(1)𝛽(2) (down,down) (S𝑧=−1) Antisymmetric (Singlet) 1 2 𝛼(1)𝛽(2) − 𝛼(2)𝛽(1) (S𝑧=0) I’ll call the spin up state 𝛼 and down 𝛽. Identical Particles Total Wavefunction symmetry • The total wavefunction for two identical particles is the product of one of the possible spatial wavefunction combinations and one of the possible spin wavefunctions. • It is the overall symmetry of the total wavefunction that is important for exchange symmetry and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

Pauli, Phys Rev, 58, 716 (1940). 16Identical Particles Pauli Exclusion is a consequence of the antisymmetry requirement Class activity: Show that the wavefunction amplitude for two electrons in the same antisymmetric spatial state is zero. Don’t forget about spin. (This question is on the worksheet.) 17Identical Particles Consequences of Exchange Symmetry • Pauli exclusion principle leads to building up of electrons in multi-electron atoms. • Corrections to the energies of multi-particle states. • The Simplest Testable Example: The Helium Atom 18 You proved ( a few slides ago) in the activity in class that two particles with antisymmetric exchange symmetry cannot be in the same state. We can therefore put only two electrons in the ground state of He. (They must have different spin) Identical Particles","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
