This says that we can express any wavefunction as a sum of pure momentum states. Class 6 - Operators and the Schrodinger Equation Quantum Physics 1 3 Introduction • Observables are physical attributes of a system that can be measured in the laboratory. • In quantum physics, in the absence of a measurement, a microscopic system does not necessarily have values of its physical properties. (A particle does not “have” a position until we measure it. It has a set of possible positions.) • We want to find out how to calculate observables from wavefunctions. The mathematical approach is through the introduction of operators. A Plausibility Argument for The Schrodinger Equation • A starting point: 1. The wave equation must be consistent with the two quantum postulates: • DeBroglie 𝜆 = ℎ 𝑝 • And Einstein 𝐸 = ℎ𝑓(= ℏ𝜔) 2. It must be consistent with • Kinetic energy + Potential Energy = Total energy: 𝑝2 2𝑚 + 𝑉 = 𝐸 3. It must be linear so that the sum of two solutions is itself a solution. • If Ψ1𝑎𝑛𝑑 Ψ2𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 Ψ12 = Ψ1 + Ψ2 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛. Class 6 - Operators and the Schrodinger Equation Quantum Physics 1 4 SE Plausibility • Assume now that the potential is constant in time and space: 𝑉 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝑉0 = 0 – The classical expression for the force on a particle is Ԧ𝐹 = −∇𝑉 so the force on the particle would be zero. – If the force is zero, then the momentum and total energy are constants. • 𝑇 + 𝑉 = 𝐸 (or 𝑝2 2𝑚 = 𝐸) so using the Einstein and DeBroglie postulates – ℎ2 2𝑚𝜆2 = ℎ𝑓 (or ℏ2𝑘2 2𝑚 = ℏ𝜔) Class 6 - Operators and the Schrodinger Equation Quantum Physics 1 5 SE Plausibility • Since we want the wave equation to be linear, the wavefunction can only appear in the first order. • Consider if a solution is a travelling wave: Ψ = 𝑓 𝑘𝑥 − 𝜔𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑢) – 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑥 = 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑢 𝜕𝑢 𝜕𝑥 = 𝑘 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑢 and 𝜕2Ψ 𝜕𝑥2 = 𝑘2 𝜕2Ψ 𝜕𝑢2 , so a second derivative in x produces the factor of 𝑘2. – The first derivative in time produces a factor of 𝜔. – Schrodinger therefore proposed that the wave equation had the form: 𝛼 𝜕2Ψ 𝜕𝑥2 = 𝛽 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑡 Class 6 - Operators and the Schrodinger Equation Quantum Physics 1 6 The Schrodinger Equation − ℏ 2 2𝑚 𝜕2Ψ 𝑥, 𝑡 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑉 𝑥, 𝑡 Ψ 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝑖ℏ 𝜕Ψ 𝜕𝑡 Class 6 - Operators and the Schrodinger Equation Quantum Physics 1 7Class 6 - Operators and the Schrodinger Equation Quantum Physics 1 8 Two ways to compute momentum 1) Given Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡), use the wave function to compute Φ𝑝(𝑝). Compute 𝑝 from නΦ∗𝑝Φ𝑑𝑝 . 2) Find a way to express 𝑝 as a function of 𝑥. Compute 𝑝 from නΨ∗𝑝(𝑥)Ψ𝑑𝑥. Finding a Momentum Operator • The Correspondence Principle states that the behavior of systems described by quantum mechanics must be consistent with classical physics in the appropriate limit. • For example: 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑝𝑥 𝑚 • Let’s follow through on this to see if we can find a simple operator that will yield 𝑝𝑥 from the space representation of the wavefunction.
