Partial substitution of anion - tune bandgap, tune charge transport (increase carrier lifetimes), improve stability (structural and chemical) - e.g. MAPb(I1-xBrx)3 – bandgap increases with x - e.g. MAPb(I1-xClx)3 – diffusion length of e and h increases with Cl 2. B-site cation mixing - tune bandgap, stabilise crystal structure at lower temp, increase luminescence - e.g. add Sn2+ reduces bandgap and increases carrier lifetimes - add Ge2+ to improve solubility (FA0.83MA0.17GexPb1-x(I0.9Br0.1)3 3.

Carrier dynamics Charge generation, transport and recombination Dr Monika Szumilo Charge carriers in perovskites perovskites behave like crystalline semiconductors: - e and h carry charge - low exciton binding energy – easy dissociation - valence and conduction band dynamics ions can move within the material: - hysteresis in JV curves (PVs) - instabilities building over time can affect charge extraction - screening effect (Coulombic) - phonon coupling - ... HOWEVER Dr Monika Szumilo Charge generation - direct bandgap -> high absorption coefficients (exceeding 105 cm-1) - low exciton binding energy 10-25meV (comparable to thermal energy at room temperature, ~26meV) - exciton dissociation into free carriers without assistance - high dielectric constant (reduced Coulombic interactions) -> free carriers formed rather than excitons - photon recycling -> emitted photons can be reabsorbed and re- emitted Dr Monika Szumilo Diffusion length Einstein relation L – carrier diffusion length D – carrier diffusion coefficient τ – carrier lifetime μ – carrier mobility kB – Boltzmann’s constant T – temperature q – elementary charge 𝐿 = 𝐷𝜏 𝐷 = 𝜇𝑘𝐵𝑇 𝑞 Dr Monika Szumilo Carrier lifetime Carrier lifetime due to defect-assisted recombination: 𝜏 = 1 𝜎𝑣𝑡ℎ𝑁𝑑 σ – capture cross-section of the defect (typically 10-15 cm2) vth – thermal velocity of the carriers (107 cm/s at RT) Nd – defect density • In high-quality perovskites, micro- or even milliseconds. • Defects can lower it to tens of nanoseconds. Dr Monika Szumilo Defects in perovskites Types of Defects: •Vacancies: • Missing ions (e.g., halide vacancies). •Interstitials: • Extra ions occupying interstitial sites. •Anti-Site Defects: • Ions occupying incorrect lattice positions. Due to defect tolerance, carrier mobilities and lifetimes remain high even with defects. •Dynamic Lattice: The organic cations (e.g., methylammonium) in hybrid perovskites are rotationally mobile, leading to dynamic disorder. •Self-Healing Properties: The mobility of ions allows the lattice to reorganize around defects, effectively \"healing\" them or mitigating their impact on electronic properties Dr Monika Szumilo Phonon coupling The Frohlich model of large polarons - couples the Coulomb field of a carrier with the macroscopic electric field of LO phonons - electric polarization caused by collective longitudinal optical vibrational modes (LO phonons) of the BX sublattice - charge carriers couple to the electric polarization field - gives the upper limit of charge mobilities - first approximation only 𝛼 = 𝑒2 ℏ𝜔0 1 ҧ𝜖 𝑚𝜔0 2ℏ α – Frohlich constant (intrinsic carrier-LO phonon coupling strength) ε – dielectric contrast (strength of the interaction) m – effective mass of the carrier ℏ𝜔0 - phonon energy Dr Monika Szumilo Charge transport - summary - high dielectric constant reduces Coulomb scattering and improves mobility - high defect tolerance (most defects are shallow) - photon recycling extends apparent diffusion lengths and carrier lifetimes - symmetric mobilities (balanced e and h transport) typically around 60-100 cm2V-1s-1 (better than OSCs, worse than silicon) - high crystallinity improves mobility as grain boundaries contain defects - mobility decreases with temperature due to increased phonon scattering - polarons form - ion migration (under E field) leads to current-voltage hysteresis and material degradation Dr Monika Szumilo Measurement Techniques for Charge Transport a.
