What is the probability of observing a particle energy of ℏ𝜔2 at 𝑡 = 0? 2) A particle is in a state given by Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴(𝜓1𝑒(𝑖𝐸1𝑡/ℏ) + 3𝜓2𝑒𝑖𝐸2𝑡/ℏ) where 𝐸1 = 1 𝑒𝑉 and 𝐸2 = 5 𝑒𝑉 and 𝜓1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜓2 are normalized wavefunctions. ______a) What is the expectation value of a large number of energy measurements of this system? Explain. ______b) What is the most likely measurement of the energy of this system? Explain. 3) The spatial wavefunction of a particle decays monotonically to zero in a particular region of space. What can you say about the eigenenergy of the state relative to the potential energy in that region?","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
