{"path":"Notes/@Summer2024/Computing for Physicists/In Class 14/Activity14.pdf","text":"1) The potential at 𝑟⃗ due to a finite dipole (with point charge separation d and dipole moment qd) can be defined in Mathematica as follows, where 𝑟𝑝⃗⃗⃗⃗ and 𝑟𝑚⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ are the locations of charge 𝑞 and −𝑞, respectively. a) Determine the 𝐸⃗⃗-field in cartesian coordinates using Grad. b) Transform the 𝐸⃗⃗-field to spherical coordinates c) Transform the 𝐸⃗⃗-field to cylindrical coordinates 2) Solve the Possion equation for the region shown below (see RegionUnion[region1,region2]), where the charge density is a constant, 𝜌 = 1 4𝜋. Implement the solution with periodic boundary conditions on the left and right edges of the rectangle (shown in red). The potential should vanish on the rest of the boundary.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
