The most likely measurement is 5, because its a 90 percent chance 1. Assume you know the energy eigenfunctions Ψ1(x, t) of the Hamiltonian operator and you find that ∫ ψ∗(x)Ψ2 d = 0.1 What is the probability of observing a particle energy of ℏω2 at any time? 2. A particle in a state given by Ψ(x, t) = A(ψ1e(iE1t/h) + 3ψ2eiE2t/ℏ) where E1 = 1eV and E2 = 5eV and both ψ1 and ψ2 are normalized a. What is the expectation value of a large number of energy measurements of this system? Explain. 3. The spatial wavefunction of a particle decays monotonically to zero in a particular region of space. What can you say about the eigenenergy of the state relative to the potential energy in that region? ∂ 2ψ ∂x2 ≈ −(E − V )ψ","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
