Arriving in London I had pulled an all-nigher on the plane. I would highly recommend against this, had I slept I would have been much more functional when I arrived. I'd recommend taking the black cab from the airport to your accommodations if you have more baggage like I did, otherwise the underground is much cheaper. I spent the first day getting my dormitory setup, and trying to not fall asleep. Learned a little about local stores, there is a chain called Sainsbury's, similar to a Kroger or Tom Thumb in the states. Additionally, there is an Aldi's and a variety of smaller corner marts nearby, which I found to be very convenient. 

Getting around London is really simple, especially if you have a credit card that supports touch-to-pay, like most modern ones do. I'd recommend downloading some form of transit map, as it can be confusing at times, but you can get nearly anywhere with either buses or trains. Plus, all subway stops have staff who are very helpful. Many busses and trains run late night or 24/7 routes, which is exceptionally nice for late nights out. 

I would also recommend making sure that your cellular carrier supports data/texts in the UK, or get a carrier SIM that does before you leave, or you're going to have a tough time navigating around once you arrive. A few other things I'd look into before coming to the UK: 

> Power Adapters:

The UK does not use either the EU or US power standard, opting instead to use a proprietary 240 volt socket. These sockets are switched individually, so make sure to check if the switch is on before complaining to other people that your whatever is not working. 

> Currency:

The UK does not use the Euro, but rather the pound, which is typically worth a little more then the US dollar. Before leaving you should A: Check to see if your debit/credit card supports foreign transactions without charging fees, and B: Get some cash in case of emergency. I think 200-300 pounds would be sufficient to get a taxi ride, or get a new sim card, or any other manner of potential pitfalls you may encounter. 

> Clothing:

This is one that people might not really think of, but people tend to dress quite decently in London. I would say if you fit in somewhere like Manhattan, you'll be fine, but if you lived in a rural area your whole life, or tend to dress very casually, you might want to think about a wardrobe refresh to not fully look like a "stupid american". In terms of weather, the weather sucks. But, its not too cold, or too rainy, its just very grey. Daily temperatures hover between 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit in January, and it rains occasionally.

> Travel:

Intercity transport in London is very good on public transit, but it does cost a bit. If you're staying for any period of time, I'd look at getting a bicycle. This will enable you to get around a lot cheaper, and for free in the cases of nearby destinations. (also riding a bike in London is really fun). If you plan on taking the train around the greater UK area, I'd also recommend considering getting a National rail Railcard, it saves 30% on train fares.
