Vienna was the first major trip outside of London I made, and I was really impressed. It emanates an incredible sense of history and culture. It was a little sleepy compared to other European capitals, especially Berlin and Amsterdam, but I think its a really excellent place to go for any lover of architecture and arts.

There are more incredible museums and interesting buildings then I could reasonably see in one weekend, but some highlights were the Natural History Museum, the Naschmarkt, Belvedere Palace and the State Hall.

The nightlife in Vienna was muted, but certainly existent. There are a good number of bars and pubs that operate late, but they do seem more spaced out then in somewhere like Soho in London.

I also really enjoyed my accommodation, at the Jo & Joe hostel, located on top of an Ikea. Its a little surreal leaving your hostel and entering into an Ikea, but honestly it worked really well. Ikea has everything you could ever need at low prices, including good food, and the Hostel also had an excellent rooftop area.
