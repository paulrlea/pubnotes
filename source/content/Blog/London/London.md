My good friend from the states studied abroad in London when he was in his freshmen year, and I picked his brain towards the end of winter break. Here are his recommendations.

## General Notes: 
Everything has student discounts.
Last minute tix or today tix for cheap tickets. 
Book flights in advance. Flights are cheaper then train, but train is nicer.
