Finally got back into the gym after an extended hiatus due to traveling to [[Albania]] and being busy with exams, as well as general laziness. I think it's interesting to investigate how quickly strength recovers after taking a break, and how you can mitigate muscle/strength loss while not working out. From what I've seen/heard, of course the best way to prevent atrophy is to not skip working out, but sometimes that doesn't work. Failing that, I think eating well-balanced, high protein meals regularly helps reduce the amount of muscle atrophy, as well as doing light exercise (walking, some push-ups etc.)
