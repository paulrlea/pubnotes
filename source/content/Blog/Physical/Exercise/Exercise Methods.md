## Different types of Exercise: 

Exercise can be roughly separated into a few different groups of subtopics, and some of these are sorely neglected by modern training methods. Or at least by me. 

### Strength: 
- The easiest to conceptualize. Strength is more or less how much your muscles can move. 
- Increased through lifting progressively heavier things for progressively more repetitions. 
### Endurance: 
- Can be further divided into muscular endurance and cardiovascular endurance. 
- Also incorporates Tendons, joints etc. 
- Trained through longer-distance cardio activities, e.g running, swimming, rucking
### Coordination:
- The ability to use different body parts together smoothly and efficiently.
- Integration of sensory information (like sight and touch) with muscular actions.
- Trained through ball sports, positioning movements, combatives, etc
### Agility:
- The ability to move quickly and easily, changing direction with speed and control.
- Speed, quick reactions, and the ability to change direction rapidly.
