Based on my own casual observations, eating large portions of proteins early in the morning helps increase my focus. However, high intensity exercise afterwards decreases my performance and causes an upset stomach. So far, I'm trying to get exercise before my first large meal of the day, and eat after. Alternatively, waiting until the late evening is also a good option, as it gives sufficient time to digest. In this case though, a light dinner is optimal. There are also studies that suggest late night meals impact sleep quality.

I should work to spread out protein consumption throughout the day. I'll work on a meal plan to accomplish this.
