I've been dosing creatine during periods of inadequate sleep to help memory formation and cognition. This usually means a 5g/day dose during periods of good sleep, and 15-20 grams on days when I get poor sleep (less then 7 hrs)

See this paper:

I think it seems to work, not so much for cognition but certainly for memory recollection and formation. I've noticed some improvement in memory creation and storage. 

Sid effects are a slight loss of hair. Might be unrelated though. Might try mitigating with Saw Palmetto extract to block DHT. Also have been experiencing more nosebleeds, but I doubt that has a direct correlation with the creatine.
