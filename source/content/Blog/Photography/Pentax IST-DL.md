A completely outdated 6 megapixel DSLR that lacks nearly any of the features of a modern camera. And I love it. First, there's the tactile feedback from a traditional DSLR. The autofocus whirring into position, the satisfying report of the shutter. You don't get that as much with modern cameras, and especially not smaller point-and-shoot style cameras. 

Secondly, I love how cheap it is. I can carry this thing around and not have to give a damn what happens to it. I bought it for 30 quid, with 2 lenses, a carry case, and a tripod for 35 quid. These deals for this generation of ancient DSLR are common with those who are upgrading kit, or simply have no use for it anymore. This means I can take it anywhere, use it in any condition, and I really couldn't care too much if it gets lost or damaged.

Thirdly, the color reproduction has the vintage feel to it. Some people will say CCD cameras look like film. They are mostly wrong. CCD cameras are a totally different technology to film cameras, and the color reproduction is going to be different as well as the image quality. However, there is a certain nostalgic air that the 25 year old sensor technology has that is lacking from modern photography in my opinion. It reminds me of seeing the vacation photos from my dads old albums, or the images of me in my youth. Which makes sense, because I was born around the time this camera was made.
