This refers to taking pictures of people. People are pretty cool, as a person, I think we are quite artistically interesting subjects. The first depiction of a person was some carving of a guy in the middle east (see vsauce's video on ghosts) but now we can just take pictures of people instead of carving them out of rock. There is a variety of ways to take pictures of people. You can do portraits, where people pose, and then you take pictures of them. Usually this is one or two people. You can do candid photos, where you take pictures of people without them knowing. There is also pictures of large groups, or pictures of distant people. 

Here are some of my favorite examples:

Photography of people is one of the types of photography I think really benefits from using awful technical form. Some of my favorite photos are over/underexposed, grainy, or washed out with the flash. In my opinion it's much more compelling to try and capture and evoke the atmosphere the photograph was taken in rather then the most visually appealing possible version of the photograph.
