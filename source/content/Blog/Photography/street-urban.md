Street and urban photography is taking pictures of things on the street. Or other urban environments. These things should be interesting and of a varied composition if you want to make your pictures enjoyable to the eye. The definition of interesting and varied might be rather subjective, but some typically good subjects are as follows: 
- Street art (graffiti for the old fashioned)
- Utility objects/infrastructure. 
- Interactions between people
- Urban wildlife (pigeons, foxes, etc)
- The filth and grime that is often overlooked. 

Some examples I have taken I will put below:

These are not definitive or exhaustive definitions. Please do not listen to me too closely, photography as an art form is restricted only by one's imagination.
