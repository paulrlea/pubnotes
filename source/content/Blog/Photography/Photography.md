The camera I use 

![[Pasted image 20250414150021.png]]

The [[Pentax IST-DL]], with the Pentax 18-55 AF Lens, and a Sigma 70-300 Telephoto Lens for distance shooting.

I like taking pictures of lots of things. Like [[street-urban]], [[landscapes]], [[people]] and [[architecture]]

I have a Pintrest (https://pin.it/68fYbZC0a) where I post images that I think are pretty cool or interesting. Some of them I'm quite proud of, like this one:
