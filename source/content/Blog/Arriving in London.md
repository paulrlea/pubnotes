Arriving in London I had pulled an all-nigher on the plane. I would highly recommend against this, had I slept I would have been much more functional when I arrived. I was sat next to a lovely Israeli family heading home from Holiday in the US, and we had good conversation about a myriad of topics. There really isn't much space to sit or get comfortable in basic economy, which made sleeping near impossible. Next time I should take some form of sleep aid to knock myself out before leaving. 

Checking into my dorm was pretty straightforward, and everyone was very friendly. I'd recommend taking the black cab from the airport to your accommodations if you have more baggage like I did, otherwise the underground is much cheaper. I spent the first day getting my dormitory setup, and trying to not fall asleep. Learned a little about local stores, there is a chain called Sainsbury's, similar to a Kroger or Tom Thumb in the states. Additionally, there is an Aldi's and a variety of smaller corner marts nearby, which I found to be very convenient. 

Getting around London is really simple, especially if you have a credit card that supports touch-to-pay, like most modern ones do. I'd recommend downloading some form of transit map, as it can be confusing at times, but you can get nearly anywhere with either buses or trains. Plus, all subway stops have staff who are very helpful. Many busses and trains run late night or 24/7 routes, which is exceptionally nice for late nights out. 

I'm really excited for the next few months. I'm working on an itinerary of places to visit across the UK and Europe to make the most of my time here. The whole landmass is incredibly interconnected, and getting around is easy.
