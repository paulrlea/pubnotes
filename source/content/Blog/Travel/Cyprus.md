Cyprus is a small island nation off the coast of Turkey and Palestine. I flew into Larnaca airport, and rented a cheap car for the weekend I was there. Without a car, you are stuck using rather unreliable busses and your own two feet, which is really not optimal. I think riding a bike or scooter would be a good alternative if you can't afford a car hire.

Cyprus has a lot of really cool things to do for a small island, with both beautiful coastlines and stunning mountains, alongside decent nightlife in the cities. The group I was with went to Paphos, a UNESCO heritage site with lots of well-preserved Greek and roman ruins. Afterwards, we went to the supposed birthplace of Aphrodite at sunset, one of the most beautiful sights on the island.

The second day, we went on a hike in the interior of Cyprus, and while we were cut short by a rain squall, what we were able to go to was incredible. The mountains are perpetually misty, with low-lying clouds floating below you and small terracotta roofed villages tucked into the valleys.

Later that day, we were able to go check out an abandoned theme park, run by a very friendly bloke who let us in for a few euros. Lots of fun to explore and look around, especially at night.
