I spent an afternoonpp in Zadar to catch a flight back to London, so I was able to see some of the cool sights. Its quite nice, a relaxing place. The old town is located on a peninsula, with a harbor on one side and the Adriatic on the other. There is a bunch of beautiful buildings to stroll around, and good food to eat.
