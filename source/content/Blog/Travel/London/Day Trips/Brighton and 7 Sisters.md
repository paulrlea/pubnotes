## Getting to Brighton
You can get to Brighton on the Thameslink from anywhere in London pretty much. Its a quick train ride, and the services are frequent. Alternatively, you can get a train from Eastbourne and do the 7 sisters hike first like I did. 

## Seven Sisters
You can see the Seven sisters cliffs from Brighton, but it would take a rather long time to get there by foot. Id advise taking a train to Seaford first, hiking from Seaford to Eastbourne, and then taking a train from Eastbourne to Brighton.

The Seven Sisters are a beautiful set of cliffs in southern England, with rolling hills behind and a sheer drop to the ocean in front. Very nice, relatively easy day hike, totaling about 20km and minimal elevation.

Make sure you bring some sunscreen and water, and a decent windbreaker if you go when its chilly out.

Towards the end of the hike, the view into Eastbourne is also rather majestic. A welcome sight after a day of hiking around.

## Brighton

Brighton itself is a rather charming beach town, though the beach is thoroughly unremarkable due to the pebbles. Its a decent place for a day trip solo, it could be more fun over a few days with some friends. Lots of overpriced entertainment on the strand, and some cool historical bits here and there as well. The pier is worth the 2 pounds to go see, and just wander about a bit.
