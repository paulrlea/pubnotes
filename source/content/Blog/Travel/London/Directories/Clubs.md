# Scala
Me and a few friends visited Scala on a Wednesday night as part of a UCL student event. Being the first proper club I've visited in London, it was a pretty great experience. Two rooms, with a multi-tier main dance floor, and decently affordable drinks if you go on student night. The music was good, and the venue is unique. I also felt like the staff seemed friendly and approachable. It does get crowded quickly, especially the main room, so be prepared for that. 

## Heaven 
Heaven is a well-known gay club in London, and with good reason. The venue is expansive, being situated under Charing Cross railway station, and has an excellent literal underground feel to it. The drinks tend to be reasonably priced as well, between 3-4 pounds for a vodka or gin soda. I went with a few friends on a Thursday night, and it was pretty empty until around 11:45, I'd recommend trying to arrive right before the big rush to get situated early.

## Ministry of Sound
From what I remember, the Ministry was an incredible time. You really can't beat the sound system, and the layout and design of the indoor spaces was top notch. I really liked how it had lots of balcony spaces and even seating areas to chat with your friends if you wanted a break from the dancing. The drinks were pricey, but that's not surprising given the reputation and location. Highly recommend, it's been my favorite dancing experience so far.

# The Egg

The Egg was a very fun smaller club located close to my accommodation. The staff were very friendly, and the venue was more cozy. The lighting and effects were unique, with a low ceiling and addressable light bars across the roof. There is also apparently a rooftop and other rooms, but they weren't open the night I went
# Colour Factory

This is a really cool offbeat joint in east London. It feels less like a club, and more like a concert venue or arts center. It appears to be situated in a repurposed industrial factory, leading to a distinctly warehouse-like atmosphere. There's also a rather decent chippy across the street.

# E1

Located in east London near the Shadwell overground station, E1 is another warehouse-like venue, with 2 large rooms. They play a lot of electronic music, and have a decent armada of special effects and lighting. Having gone two times, I think that it can be hit or miss depending on the amount of people there, because the rooms are quite spacious and it feels a bit empty if there's not enough people.
