- Stems from orbital angular momentum of an electron
	- F electrons in particular

$$
\vec{l} = \vec{r}\times  \vec{p}
$$
Electron current is 
$$
I = -\frac{e}{T}
$$
Where T is equivalent to the time it takes an electron to orbit
$$
T=\frac{v}{2\pi r} 
$$
Magnetic moment is also the current multiplied by the area 
$$
|\vec{\mu}_{e}| = I\pi r^{2} = \frac{e}{2m_{e}} |\vec{l}|
$$
$$
|\vec{\mu}_{e}| = \sqrt{ l(l+1) } \mu_{b}
$$
Diamagnetism is weaker then para-magnetism and [[ferromagnetism]]
