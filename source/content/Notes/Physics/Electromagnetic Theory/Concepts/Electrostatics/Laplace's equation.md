The Laplace equation is to find V(r) in a volume empty of electric charge 
It is a variant of the Poisson Equation, a more general version that allows the volume to contain electric charge.
$$
\vec{\nabla}^{2}V = 0
$$
- It is a linear homogeneous 2nd order partial differential equation. 
- In mathematical sciences it is classified as an elliptic differential equation 
- Analytically has been solved in 11 coordinate systems
	- This class only pertains spherical and Cartesian coordinate system
