Encompasses 4 primary laws. 
[[Ampere-Maxwell Law]]
[[Gauss' Law]]
[[Gauss' Law for magnetic field]]
[[@Spring2024/Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Electrostatics/Faraday's Law]]

All of non-relativistic electromagnetism can be derived from these 4 laws, except for some specific material properties. 

Also see differential form of these laws.
