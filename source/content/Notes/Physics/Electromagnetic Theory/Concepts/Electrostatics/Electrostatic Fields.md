Electrostatics and Magnetostatics
	- Nothing depends on time. (static)
	- The time derivative is 0
	$$
			  \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0
			  $$
	- Definition of electrostatic fields and potentials
	- [[Gauss' Law]] and [[@Spring2024/Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Electrostatics/Faraday's Law]] for static [[@Spring2024/Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Electrostatics/Electric Field]]s in differential form are the mathematical description of electric field lines
	- Follows [[Maxwell's Laws]]
