- Given several point charges the total force on another point charge is the summation of forces from the individual point charges
$$
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}_{1} + \mathbf{F}_{2} + \dots =\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{q_{1}Q}{r^{2}_{1}}\hat{r_{1}} +  \frac{q_{1}Q}{r^{2}_{2}}\hat{r_{2}}  + \dots\right)
$$
- This sucks. Lets use the electric field instead. 
- We define the electric field as:
$$
\mathbf{E(r)} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{q_{i}}{r^{2}_{i}} \hat{r}_{i}
$$
- And the force from the electric field on a point charge Q is given by 
$$
\mathbf{F} = Q \mathbf{E}
$$
- The electric field is a **function of position**. 
- It is a **vector quantity.**
