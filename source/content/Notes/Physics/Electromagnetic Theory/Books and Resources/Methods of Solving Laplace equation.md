In this class we go over the following methods: 
- Solving both Laplace and Poisson's Equation via direct integration
	- See [[2024-01-25 Laplace Via Direct Integration]]
- Solving Laplace's Equation via Image charges and Multi-pole Expansion
	- See [[2024-01-29 Method of image charges]] and [[Class 9 Multipole Expansion 020824.pdf]]
- Solving Poisson's Equation via Spherical and Cartesian Coordinates.
	- See [[2024-02-05 Spherical Laplace Eq.]] and [[2024-02-01 Laplace's Equation Fourier Series]]
