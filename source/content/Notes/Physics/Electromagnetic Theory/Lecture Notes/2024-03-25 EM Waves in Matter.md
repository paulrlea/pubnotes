# Review
- We went over EM waves in vacuum
- Electric and magnetic waves are $\perp$ 
- Linear materials designate materials where the electric field is independent from external electric field
# Electromagnetic Waves in matter
- [[Maxwell's Laws]] remain about the same, with ampere's law changing to 
$$
\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B} = \mu\epsilon \vec{\dot{B}}
$$

Speed of waves in material is equal to 
$$
\frac{C}{n} = v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \mu\epsilon }}
$$

## Reflections and Refraction
Using Snell's Law we can calculate the refraction angle between two substances
$$
n_{1}\sin\tan \theta_{1} = n_{2} \sin(\theta_{2})
$$
Boundary Conditions:
- Face of Waves must be continuous at interface
- Reflected Wave must have the same wave-vector as the incident wave
$$
k\sin\theta_{i} = k' \sin\theta_{t}=k\sin\theta_{r}
$$
### Total internal Reflection 

### Polarization!
Polarization has two different meanings in EM theory
Meaning 1: 
Macroscopic Electric polarization $\mathbf{P}$ of a dielectric material 

Meaning 2: 
Polarization of the electromagnetic wave $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t )$.
(linear circular or elliptic)

### Brewster Angle
-  angle of incidence wherein there is no reflected EM wave. 
- Makes lasers !!!1!!
