# Electromagnetic Radiation 

- Transportation of electromagnetic energy through the [[Poynting vector]]

Forms of engineered electromagnetic radiation 
- Electric dipole radiation 
- Magnetic dipole radiation 
- Arbitrary radiation 

Radiation fields from dipoles start from [[retarded potentials]]

### Characteristic Length Scales 

- Size of oscillating dipole
- Wavelength of EM radiation 
- Distance between field point and dipole

Example: 5g cell network 
- $\lambda$ @28ghz is approx 1.1cm
- Antenna size ($\lambda/2$ to $\lambda/4$) d approx 0.25 to 0.55 cm
- Antenna range is approximately 10 miles

Wavelength is much much less then distance to field point

Question 11.1 and 11.2

11.1 
Modify A 
$$
-\frac{\mu_{0}p_{0}\omega}{4\pi r}\left( \left[ \sin\left( \omega\left( t-\frac{r}{c} \right) \right) \right]\cos\theta \mathbf{\hat{r}} - \left[ \sin\left( \omega\left( t-\frac{r}{c} \right) \right) \right] \sin\theta \mathbf{\hat{\theta}} \right)
