## Review
- Electric charges re the sources of electric fields 
- If a field is present there must be a charge
- If curl is 0, then a field is an electrostatic field
- Introduction of potential as a scalar function of electric field
- [[Poisson's Equation]] and [[Laplace's equation]]

## Conductors Lecture
- Conductors are materials in which electrons can move freely.
	- Metals are conductors
- This is because the valence band and conduction band overlap at a microscopic scale
- Basic facts about conductors
	- The static field and net electric charge inside a conductor is always 0 
	- Any net electrical charges sit on the surface of the conductor
	- The static electric field is always perpendicular at the surface of the conductor
	- Magnitude of static electric field at surface
	$$
	E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}
	$$
	- If the surface is grounded, potential at surface is 0
	- Surface charge density can be calculated as (check this)
	$$
	\sigma=-\epsilon_{0} \frac{dv}{d\tau}
	$$
	- The movement of charge is basically instantaneous
	- Charges distribute themselves at the surface, leading to 0 electric field

- Electrons will move freely throughout a conductor, moving towards positive charges and away from negative ones

e.
Surface charge density of conductor $\sigma_{R}$ would change, electric field outside the conductor would change.
