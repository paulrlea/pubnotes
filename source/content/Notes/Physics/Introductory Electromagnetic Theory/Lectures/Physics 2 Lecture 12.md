# Magnetic Forces and Fields

- Currents exert forces that cannot be explained by electrostatics
- This is called the [[magnetic force]] given by
$$
\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}
$$
with $q$ representing the charge of the particle, $\vec{v}$ being the velocity vector and $\vec{B}$ representing the magnetic field. 

# Right hand rule
- The direction of the vector cross product is given by the right hand rule. 
$$
\vec{c} = \vec{a} \times \vec{b}; \ |\vec{c}| = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| \sin(\Phi)
$$
