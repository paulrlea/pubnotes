Short answer problem 1. 
- Use Gauss's law
- Do spherical integral to find integral of electric field over Gaussian surface
- Set equal to enclosed charge over $\epsilon_{0}$. 
$$
q_{enc} (r) = 4\pi \int ^{r}_{0}p(r^{'})r^{'2} \, dr^{'} 
$$
- Non-uniform charge density
Short answer problem 2
- DC circuit
- Find current through 6$\Omega$ resistor
- Use [[Kirchhoff's loop rule]] and junction rule 
- Choose a direction around both loops and increment EMF through each element of both loops
- Sign convention
- Considering three currents, one on the left, one on right side, and current in the middle resistor
Short answer problem 3
- LRC Circuit
- Given values: 
	- 45 mH inductor
	- 50 $\Omega$ resistor
	- 30 $\mu F$ capacitor
	- 220 VAC
	- 200 Hz
```math
omega = 2 pi 200 
l=455E-3
c=30E-6
r=50
z=sqrt(r^2  + (omega * l - (1/(omega * c))^2))
```
