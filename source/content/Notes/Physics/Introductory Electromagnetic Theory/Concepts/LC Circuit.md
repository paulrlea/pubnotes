LC Circuit consists of a charged capacitor and an inductor in series

We will once again be using the loop rule for this system:
$$
-L \frac{di}{dt} - \frac{q}{c} = 0 \implies L \frac{d^{2}q}{dt^{2}} + \frac{q}{c} = 0
$$
$$
q(t) = Q_{max} \cos(\omega t = \phi)
$$
where $\omega =\frac{1}{\sqrt{ LC }}$
This is similar to mass on a spring harmonic oscillations, but the energy storage is all electric and is being transformed into magnetic energy. Cool stuff. 

Electric field => Spring (potential) energy
Magnetic field => Magnetic (kinetic) energy

>It is very interesting to see how themes play out throughout physics. The same harmonic oscillation problems also come up in QP1, and I am sure they will appear in IQM and Theoretical Mech. 

For our electric system:
$$
U_{E} = \frac{q^{2}}{2C} = \frac{Q^{2}}{2C}\cos ^{2}(\omega t+ \phi)
$$
$$
U_{B} = \frac{1}{2} L^{2} = \frac{1}{2} LI^{2}\sin ^{2}(\omega t + \phi)
$$
$$
U_{E} + U_{B} = constant
$$
