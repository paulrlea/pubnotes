Magnetic Flux is defined as
$$
d\Phi_{B} = B \perp dA = B\cos(\phi)dA = \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A}
$$
Where Magnetic flux is $\Phi_{B}$ , $\phi$ is the angle between the surface and the [[Magnetic Field]], $B$. 

Magnetic Flux is measured in units of Weber, with SI abbreviation Wb.

One Weber is equal to $1 T\cdot m^{2}$
