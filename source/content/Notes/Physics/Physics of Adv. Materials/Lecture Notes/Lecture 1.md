## Organic Semiconductors:
### What are organic semiconductors?
- Carbon based
- Typically polymers, such as plastics, rubbers, etc 
- Aka Plastic Electronics

Helps overcome problems with traditional semiconductors, such as silicon. 
Silicon is high-quality and easy to obtain, but:
- very energy-intensive and expensive to refine
- Doesn't work well for large area applications. 
- Very heavy.

OSC's are cheap to make, flexible, biocompatible, and can be made in large sizes, but:
- slower then silicon
- sensitive to water, UV, o2


OSC's fall into two classes, polymer and molecular. 


## How do OSC's work?

Carbon has 6 electrons, stored in 3 orbitals. 

These electrons can be stored in a "hybridized" orbital,  between the S and P orbitals.

We are most interested in the sp2 hybridization, because with this the remaining electron in the p_z orbital has interesting properties.

Carbon Atom bonding:

Sigma bonds:
- Strong
- Single direction 
- can rotate
- Responsible for carbon chaining

$\pi$ bonds:
- Weaker
- Prevents rotation
- Most importantly: Allows de-localisation of $\pi$ orbitals, which allows carbon to conduct electricity. 

Adjustable band gaps:
- The presence of pi bonds allows for adjustable band gaps.
**HOMO**: Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital
**LUMO**: Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

In summary: 
Size of bandgap in molecule depends on two major things:
- Molecule composition
	- This is length of 
- Planarity


### Key question:
 Q: How does the concept of hybridization contribute to the understanding of organic semiconductors?
 - It explains the formation of delocalized electron clouds.
 - It predicts the geometry of the molecules.
 - It helps to understand the energy levels of molecular orbitals.

## Polarons:

### Peierl's transition, aka dimerization:
- When carbon atoms come in pairs?

## Key Question: 
Q: What is the main driving force for Peierl's transition in conjugated polymers?
A: To achieve a lower energy state.

Q: How does the presence of polarons affect the optical properties of an organic semiconductor?
A: It leads to the formation of new absorption bands.

## Excitons:

- Quasi-particle
- Comes in Wannier and Frenkel flavours

Wannier Excitons:
- Weak
- 10 milli- eV
- Large distance
- Found in inorg. semiconductors
Frenkel Excitons:
- Strong
- Binding energy 0.2-1 eV
- Small distance 
- Typically in OSC's
- Easily recombines


## Singlet-triplet splitting:
- Ground state is typically a singlet
- The exchange energy is the difference between first excited singlet state and first excited triplet state
- Triplet states are useless, and cant be converted to singlet states. 
	- Active area of research due to being source of inefficiency
- What does "manifold" mean in this context


## Spectroscopy


> An exciton is a bound state of an electron and a hole
