- First tried to solve by Galileo, thought it was a piece of a circle
- Then some dude with weird eyes (Bernoulli) and solved this with a clever solution. 
- He applied Snell's law to the problem, and realized that light can be applied to the problem. 
- It also happens to be a [[Cycloid Curve]]
	- These curves are also tautochrone curves. This means that over the course of the curve, if you start a ball at any point (assuming no friction) then they will all reach the end at the same point
