The Euler-Lagrange equation is the cornerstone of [[2024-01-23 Lagrangian Mechanics]]. 
It is given by 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{ \partial L }{ \partial \dot{x} }  - \frac{ \partial L }{ \partial x }  = 0
$$
Where $L$ represents the [[Lagrangian]] and the arbitrary variable on the bottom can be any variable of motion within the system of coordinates you are working in, including [[Cartesian Coordinates]], [[Polar Coordinates]], [[Cylindrical Coordinates]] or [[Spherical Coordinates]]
