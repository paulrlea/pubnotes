- The most suitable set of coordinates to describe the position of an object or the state of the system
- In other words, we are aiming to reduce the number of differential equations

### Example: 2-d projectile motion
Cartesian coordinates! 
You have a y-component, and an x component
Motion in x and y is independent of each other 
Therefore there is 2 general equations

### Example: Uniform circular motion 
Polar coordinates!
x is dependent on y
r and theta are independent, therefore use those
2 general equations
