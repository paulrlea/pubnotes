The Hamiltonian is equivalent to the below
$$
E =H=T+U
$$
It is the total energy within the system. See equation 7.130 in the theoretical mechanics textbook for a derivation. 

The Hamiltonian is equivalent to the total energy $E$ if the following conditions are met: 
- The equations connecting generalized to rectangular/whatever-system-you're using have to be non-time dependent
- Potential energy can't be velocity dependent
