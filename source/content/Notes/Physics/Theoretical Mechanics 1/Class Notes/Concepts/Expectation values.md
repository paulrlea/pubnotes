The expectation value is the "average" value of an observable over very many measurements, and is given by the following for an arbitrary operator $\hat{A}$ in a quantum state $\Psi$
$$
<A> = \int \Psi^* (x) \hat{A} \Psi(x) \, dx
$$
This is poorly named, because it is not the most likely value. It is the average value of an [[observable]] over all spaces where the wave function can exist.
