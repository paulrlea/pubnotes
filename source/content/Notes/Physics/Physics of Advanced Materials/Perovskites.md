Perovskites are a class of crystal structure composed of three primary parts:
- A site large cation
- B site small cation
- X/O Anion

The composition of these components affects the properties of the perovskite

These include: 
- Tunable band-gaps
- Tunable stability 

2D Perovskites:

Benefits: 
Tunable bandgap by using organic spacer layering
Protection from elements 

Drawbacks:
hard to synthisize
Lower absorbtion coefficients

Common Perovskite components and rationale:

FA: Reduces bandgap, improves thermal stability
MA: Better crystalization and film formation
Cs: Reduces defects, stabilizes phase
Pb: Forms strong bonds with halides, good band structure fr charge carrier transport. Longer carrier diffusion lengths
I: Narrower bandgap
Br: Wider bandgap
