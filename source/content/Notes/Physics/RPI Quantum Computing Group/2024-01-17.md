# Quantum Simulation 
- Use to study small physics models quantum mechanically
### Ex. Ising Model
- If you can get the Hamiltonian, you can solve the system with a quantum computer
$$
H_{ising} = -J \sum_{i} \sigma_{1}^{z}\dots
$$

Problem: Noise in system
Answer: Noise mitigation techniques (eg. Zero-Noise Extrapolation )
Very physics-y approach to quantum computing. More classical approach
### Quantum Error Prevention
- Big problem with quantum computers is noise
- A single photon can disrupt whole system by propagating down the system
- See N&C Chapter 10
	- Also need to review chapters 1&2
- Come up with ways to remove noise from the ground up vs removing noise from the final product
Idea: Quantum information from local noise by encoding non-locally in multiqubit states
Local noise: Photons, etc
Why?
	We need very low error rates for quantum computing. Classical computers have $\sim1$ in $10^{17}$ error rate. Quantum computing is very powerful but very fragile. 

- Perfect accuracy isn't needed, especially for systems that cannot be classically computed.
- Quantum computing errors are harder to fix, because errors are persistent and continuous. 
Where did quantum error correction/prevention start?
- Peter Shor 96': Fault tolerant quantum computing
- Alexander Kitaev 97':  Topological codes in 2D
- Gottesman 97': Stabilizer codes 
We want to eventually get to Gottemans research in stabilizer codes. 

### The Classical Repetition code
- Takes a classical bit, with probability p that it gets flipped to a 1 or to a 0. p probability of error .
- 1-p probability of not error. 
- This is known as a binary symmetric channel

- Can protect against these flips with 3-bit repetition code
	- Encode:
		- $0 \to \bar{0} =000$ 
		- $1\to \bar{1} \to111$
			- Cloning?
		- $\bar{1}$ and $\bar{0}$ are logical 1s and 0s
		- Noise correction
			- $\bar{0} = 000 \to 100$
			- Corrects to $000$ via majority voting
		- Probability of 2,3 flips
			- These are only discrete errors
		- Probability of 2 or 3 flips
$$
p_{e} = \begin{pmatrix}
3 \\
2
\end{pmatrix} p^{2}(1-p) + p^{3}=3p^{2} -2p^{3}
$$
You can graph this error percentage

- Key points 
	- Dealing with classical bits 
	- Repeat the bit and use majority vote to calculate probability and correct bit
	- You can use an $n^{th}$ number of repeating bits
	- Maximize $p$ and determine what level of error is acceptable 


**EXERCISE! (do at home)**
**Calculate for case of 5 bit repetition probability of error ($p_{e}$) for having 3,4,5 bit flips.**

This also happens to be a binomial distribution

### The 3-Qubit bit flip code
- Combining this and phase flip code give Shor code
- Quantum!
- Might worry about: 
	- No cloning theorem
		- Can't do classical repetition code, because cloning the information breaks it
		- $\ket{\psi} !\to \ket{\psi}\ket{\psi}\ket{\psi}$
		- $\ket{\psi} = a\ket{0} +b\ket{1}$
			- normalized:
			- $\ket{\psi} = \frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}$
			- Bell state: 
			- $\ket{\psi} = \frac{\ket{01}\pm\ket{10}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}$
			- The two states (1 and 0) are entangled, when you make a measurement of an observable ($\mathcal{O}$) you use an operator on the wave function 
			- $\bra{\psi}\mathcal{O}\ket{\psi} = \langle\mathcal{O}\rangle$ 
	- Errors are continuous (not discrete)
	- Measurement destroys quantum information (QI)
- All these things are not a problem!

The 3 Qubit bit flip code can correct a single flip.
$$
\ket{1} \to \ket{\bar{0}} = \ket{000} 
$$
$$
\ket{1} \to \ket{\bar{1}} = \ket{111} 
$$
The general quantum state is given by a a superposition of 0 and 1
$$
a\ket{0} + b\ket{1} \to a\ket{000} +b\ket{111} \equiv a\ket{\bar{0}} +b\ket{\bar{1}}  
$$
Encoding circuit: 
![[Pasted image 20240117150636.png]]
When extra qubits are introduced, they're known as ancillas. 
$$
\ket{\psi_{0}} = \ket{\psi} \ket{0} \ket{0} = (a\ket{0} +b\ket{1} ) \ket{0} \ket{0} 
$$
$$
\ket{\psi_{1}} = (a\ket{00} +b\ket{11} )\ket{0} 
$$
$$
\ket{\psi_{2}}=(1\ket{000} + b\ket{111} )
$$
What does this protect against?
$$
a\ket{0} + b\ket{1}\to a\ket{000} + b\ket{111}  
$$
A bit is flipped (Pauli x operator)
$$
a\ket{100} + b\ket{011}  
$$
Naive measurement
$$
\ket{100} \  w.p \ |a|^{2}
$$
$$
\ket{011} \  w.p \ |b|^{2}
$$
Cant measure directly, will collapse wave function 
Need subtlety!

#### 2-step error correction 
- First step- Detect which bit is flipped
	- Error detection (syndrome measurement)
- Second step- Recovery 
	- Getting back what you had
- Observables
- apply $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ to first and second bit respectively
$$
z_{1} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
- If there was  a bit flip on any one of the 3 bits,  a specific state is returned that mirrors the state of the system. You can use this to detect which bit is flipped and recover the system

**EXERCISE!
Check to see if applying matrices works**

This way you're not accessing a or b, bypassing the wave function collapse that would otherwise occur.

- Any error that works, this can fix
- Only works for single bit flips though 

Look into tensor products $\otimes$

#### 3 Qubit phase flip code

- A phase error/flip is a when the bits have not been flipped, but the phase (polarity?) has been flipped
$$
\frac{\ket{000}+\ket{111} }{\sqrt{ 2 }} \to \frac{\ket{000}-\ket{111} }{\sqrt{ 2 }}  
$$
- After discussion: 
	- $\ket{\bar{0}} = \ket{+++}$
	- $\ket{\bar{1}} = \ket{111}$
	- Doing same thing as before but with different basis
	- $\ket{\pm} = \frac{\ket{0}\pm \ket{1}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}$
- Encoding circuit: 
![[Pasted image 20240117154522.png]]
- Use Hadamard gate (H) ( why only hadamard gates on ancillias on board?)
	- Turns 0 and 1 into + and -
	- At the point before the Hadamard gate similar to 3-qubit bit flip code 
- Phase flip
$$
\ket{\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}(\ket{0} \pm \ket{1} ) \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}(\ket{0} \mp  \ket{1} ) = \mp
$$
$\psi_{1}$ is after the noise.

Put bit flip and phase flip together to make Shor code, very powerful! can correct any error on single qubit
