The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the wave function of a physical system evolves over time. It is named after the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, who formulated it in 1925.

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a non-relativistic particle (i.e., a particle not moving close to the speed of light) is given by:

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$$

Here's what the terms in the equation represent:

- $i$ is the imaginary unit $i^2 = -1$.
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics.
- $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$denotes the partial derivative with respect to time \(t\).
- $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the wave function, which is a mathematical function that contains all the information about a quantum system. It depends on the spatial coordinates $r$ and time $t$.
- $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, which represents the total energy operator of the system.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation, which is a special case for systems with constant energy (i.e., systems not subject to time-dependent external forces), is given by:

$$\hat{H} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E \psi(\mathbf{r})$$

Here, $\psi(r)$ is the spatial part of the wave function, which depends only on the spatial coordinates $\mathbf{r}$, and $E$ represents the energy of the system.

Solving the Schrödinger equation allows us to determine the allowed energy levels and corresponding wave functions for a given quantum system. The wave function provides a complete description of the system's quantum state, and from it, we can calculate various observables, such as position, momentum, and energy.

It's important to note that the Schrödinger equation is a cornerstone of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, applicable to systems that do not involve speeds approaching the speed of light. For relativistic particles, a different equation, the Dirac equation, is used.
