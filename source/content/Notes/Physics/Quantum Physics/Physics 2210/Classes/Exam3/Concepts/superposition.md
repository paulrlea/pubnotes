Superposition is the combination of two or more waves. Superposition of wave functions can satisfy the [[Notes/Physics/Quantum Physics/Physics 2210/Classes/Exam3/Concepts/Schrodinger equation]] because it is linear differential equation, so $\psi_{1} \ \& \ \psi_{2}$ are solutions, then
$$
c_{1}\psi_{1}+c_{2} \psi_{2}
$$
is also a solution.
