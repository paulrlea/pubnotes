If an operator has
 1. Real Eigenvalues
 2. Orthogonal Eigenfunctions and distinct Eigenvalues for these Eigenfunctions,
 3. Eigenfunctions that form a complete set: i.e can express any function as a superposition of its constituent eigenfunctions. 
 Then the operator is known as a hermitian operator.
N.B: Observational operators are hermitian. 

Example: 
$$
\int ^{\infty}_{-\infty} \varphi^*(A\Psi)\, dx = \int ^{\infty}_{-\infty} (A\varphi)^{*} \Psi \, dx =\int ^{\infty}_{-\infty} \varphi^{*} A^{\dagger} \Psi  \, dx 
$$
