Particle in a box is a situation in which a particle is in a "box" that is defined by having infinite potential on both sides. 

The [[wave function]] for the infinite square well is given by the following: 
$$
\psi_{n} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L} } \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)
$$
with corresponding [[Notes/Physics/Quantum Physics/Physics 2210/Classes/Exam3/Concepts/Quantum Energy Levels]] given by 
$$
E_{n}= \frac{n^{2}\pi^{2}\hbar^{2}}{2mL^{2}}
$$
Probabilities of a specific energy are given by the [[Notes/Physics/Quantum Physics/Physics 2210/Classes/Exam3/Concepts/Fourier Coefficient]] and work out to the following: 
$$
\int \varphi^{*}_{n}(x) \Psi(x,0) \, dx = c_{n}
$$
and probability is $|c_{n}|^{2}$.
