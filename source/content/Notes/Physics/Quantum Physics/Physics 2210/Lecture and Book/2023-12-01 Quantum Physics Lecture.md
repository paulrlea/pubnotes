# Orbital Angular Momentum 
Hamiltonian Defined by 

$$
H = H_{0} -\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B}
$$
Where $H_{0}$ is the Hydrogen-like atom Hamiltonian:
$$
\frac{P^{2}}{2m} + V(r)
$$
Total angular momentum is defined by: 
$$
|\vec{L}| = \sqrt{ l(l+1) } \hbar
$$
where $l=1,2,3,\dots$

$$
-\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B} = -g \frac{qB_{z}}{2m_{0}} L_{z} 
$$
$g=1$ for electron
For hydrogen atom Hamiltonian with energy level $n$
$$
H \implies E_{n} - \frac{qB_{Z}}{2m_{0}}m\hbar
$$
	NB: $m$ in above equation is **not mass**, $m_{0}$ is mass. 

# Intrinsic Spin

Spin in QM has no analogy in classical dynamics

Consider case where there is no angular momentum, $L=0$

Contribution to Hamiltonian from spin: 
$$
H = -\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B} = -g \frac{qB_{z}}{2m_{0}} \cdot s\hbar
$$
Where $s$ is the spin quantum number. For an electron, the spin values can be $+/- \frac{1}{2}$ 

"g value" for intrinsic spin for electrons is 2. For protons is 5.6

What is g value?

Hydrogen Hamiltonian is comprised of the potential term, kinetic term, spin term and angular momentum term.

Hamiltonian for Spin
$$
H=-\vec{\mu}_{s} \cdot \vec{B} = \omega_{0}S_{z}
$$
$$
\omega_{0} = -\frac{g|e|B_{z}}{2m_{0}} ; \ \ g = +5.6 
$$

for protons

Gives use to 2 level system in 
$\omega_{0} =$ both $+/- \frac{\hbar}{2}$

In class 26.1

$$
\omega_{0} = -\frac{5.6 * 21 * 1.602Eâˆ’19}{2(1.67E-27)}

Either something goes through or not. 

## Quantum Computing:
You use the fact that quantum mechanical systems are a linear combination of many states. Instead of just 2 bits, you can have a large number of "qubits" that arise from the linear superposition of the two level states. 

- 2 level systems denoted by 
	$\chi_{+} = \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\   0   \end{pmatrix}$ and $\chi_{-} = \begin{pmatrix}   0 \\   1   \end{pmatrix}$

Recall: 
$$
\chi_{+} = \chi_{sm}
$$
$$
\psi = \alpha \chi_{+} + \beta \chi_{-}
$$


Block Sphere describes a superposition of states. 

$$
\psi = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} + e^{ i \phi} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} 
$$
in matrix notation: 
$$
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\begin{pmatrix}   1 \\   1   \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }} \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\   0   \end{pmatrix} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\begin{pmatrix}   0 \\   1   \end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\theta = e^{i\phi} ; \ \ \phi =0
