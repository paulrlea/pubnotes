#incomplete 
- Solution to wave problem with [[ansatz]]
- Interference problems
$$
E(d,0) = e^{ikd_{1}} (1+e^{ik\Delta d})
$$
- Double slit problem
	- Constructive Interference 
	- Maxima and Minima
$$
d\sin(\theta) = n\lambda
$$
- Single Slit problem
	- Large central maxima (~20x surrounding)
$$
a\sin(\theta) = m\lambda
$$
- **M is for minima, N is for maxima**
