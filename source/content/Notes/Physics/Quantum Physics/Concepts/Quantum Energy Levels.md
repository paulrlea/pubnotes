Quantum Energy Levels for the 1d infinite square well are defined by 
$$
E_{n} =  \frac{n^{2}\hbar^{2}\pi^{2}}{2mL^{2}}
$$
Where the quantized energy level is given by $E_{n}$ , n is any integer greater then 0, $m$ is mass, $L$ is distance and the rest are constants. 
Quantum energy levels are dependent on the principal quantum number. [[degeneracy]] of a quantum energy level means how many combinations of quantum numbers for each axis can be used to yield a particular quantum energy level.
