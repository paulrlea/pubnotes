Using the following equation, 
$$
\Psi(x,t) = \sum c_{n} \psi_{n} (x)
$$
We can draw an analogy to geometrical vector space $\mathcal{V}$, where we have vectors $\vec{A}, \vec{B}$ that are composed of unit vectors $\hat{i}, \hat{j}\ \& \ \hat{k}$. If we take an analogy to wave-function vector space, we can compose objects (vectors), $\Psi(x,t)$ with unit vectors $\varphi_{n}$ and $\varphi_{m}^{*}$.

Applying the above, we can have a basis vector:
$$
\varphi_{n}(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{2}{L} } \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right) 
$$
Represent an [[eigenfunction]] of the Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ in the following equation: 
$$
\left[ -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + V(x) \right]\varphi(x) = E\varphi(x)
$$
where the Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ is represented in the square brackets. If you solve for appropriate values of E and $\varphi$, you can graph it:

$$
\vec{A} = A_{x} \hat{i} +  A_{y} \hat{j} + A_{z} \hat{k}
$$
