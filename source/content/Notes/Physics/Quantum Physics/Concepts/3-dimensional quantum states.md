## Bullet Points
- Cartesian vs Spherical cords
- Examples used are 3D box, H-atom
- Angular momentum
$$
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \hat{p}
$$
Angular momentum on z axis
$$
\hat{L}_{z} = \frac{\hbar}{i} \frac{d}{d\phi} \to \hat{L}_{z} \Phi = m\hbar \Phi
$$
	$\hat{L}_{z}$ and $\hat{L}_{y}$ commute, but $\hat{L}_{x}$ and $\hat{L}_{y}$ do not

## Bound States and Free particle
- Similar to 2-d problems, there are "free" states and "bound"' states.

- We can use separation of variables in Cartesian/spherical coordinate systems.

- Potential can be modeled by the following: $$
V(r) \propto -\frac{1}{r} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{ x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} }}
$$
- Using separation of variables sometimes doesn't work for Cartesian variables, but works for spherical variables. 
- Example of separation of variables: 
$$
-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \left[ \frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}}+\frac{d^{2}\psi}{dy^{2}} +\frac{d^{2}\psi}{dz^{2}} \right]= E\psi(x,y,z)
$$
$$
\Psi(x,y,z) = \phi_{x}(x) \phi_{y}(y)\phi_{z}(z)
$$
