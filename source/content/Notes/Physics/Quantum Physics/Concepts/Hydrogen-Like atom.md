$$
\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r)Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)
$$
- Any particle with 1 electron is hydrogen-like. Neutrons and Protons don't really matter. Multi particle systems not covered until grad level. 
Potential for HLS given by 
$$
V(r) = -\frac{ze^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}; \ z=1
$$
Solution for R
$$
R(r) = r^{l}Fn(r)e^{-\sqrt{ 2m_{0}E/\hbar^{2} }r}
$$
Energy levels given by:
$$
E_{n} = -\frac{(13.6ev)Z^{2}}{n^{2}} ; n= 1,2,3,\dots
$$

Coulomb Potential shown above. Bound state. 
N is quantum number for $L_{z}$
Particle is in bound state because E is less then V. See also 1 dimensional bound state.
