Because the system is already in an eigenstate with eigenvalue 0, the value is already determined and therefore the uncertainty is 0. The question states that the spherical harmonic $Y_{0,0}$ is an eigenfunction of $L_{zop}$, and therefore the components of angular momentum for $l_{x,y,z}$ are all 0. This is consistent with the uncertainty relationship because $0 \times 0=0$.
