# Practice Test Overview

1.  Spherical Harmonics

- We have a spherical Hamiltonian with derivatives in r, $\theta$ and $\phi$
$$
H_{sp} \Psi \to \psi = R(r)\Theta(\theta) \Phi(\phi)
$$
Solving the spherical potential $V(r)$ leads to a specific set of $\theta$ and $\phi$ solutions, these are the spherical harmonics. 
$$
|L^{2}| = l(l+1)\hbar^{2}
$$
For the hydrogen atom, coulomb potential, l must be less then n, which is the principle quantum number, solution of energy eigenstate.
$$
L_{z} = m_{l} \hbar
$$
and
$$
-l < m_{l} < l
$$
$$
\iint y_{l,m} y_{l',m'} \sin\theta \  d\theta d\phi
$$
$$
 = \delta_{l,l'} \delta_{m,m'}
$$
The integral over spherical harmonics is 1 because they are independently normalized. They also form an orthogonal basis set, and a complete set. You can describe any function that is a function of $\theta$ and $\phi$ as a sum of spherical harmonics times a constant.

Back to the question: 
$$
\left< L^{2} \right> = c_{3,2}^{2} L^{2}_{3,2} + c^{2}_{2,1} L^{2}_{2,1}
$$
$$
\frac{1}{2}(3(3+1)\hbar^{2})+ \frac{1}{2}(2(2+1)\hbar^{2})
$$
Spin is added to total angular momentum, but not orbital angular momentum. $L$ is orbital angular momentum, $S$ is spin angular momentum


2.  Finding the expectation value of $L_{z}$

Set up the same way you set up for $L^{2}$

The relevant integer is 2 and 1. 

3. Positronium is the bound state of an electron 

$$
E = 13.6ev  \frac{Z_{eff}^{2}}{h^{2}}
$$
$$
=-E_{ry} \frac{z^{2}}{h^{2}}
$$
there's a term for mass somewhere in there to some power. Use effective mass
$$
\mu  = \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}
$$
We have two masses that are the same, therefore the effective mass $\mu$ is 1/2 of an electron mass 

$$
-E_{ay} \frac{z^{2}}{h^{2}} \mu^{?}
$$
If it were hydrogen, it would be A. It is not hydrogen, it needs to be scaled to the proper mass. 
$$
\Delta E _{Hyd} = -13.6 \left(  \frac{1}{n_{up}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n^{2}_{low}} \right)
$$
4. The wavelength question 
$$
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} 
$$
$$
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{1}} - \frac{hc}{\lambda_{2}}
$$
$$
hc \approx 1240 ev - nm
$$
5. Two wavefunctions with different momentum
If two eigenfunctions have two different eigenfunction solutions, are they orthogonal. This orthogonality relationship means that they are 0 if multiplied together. This goes to 0. 
$$
p_{op} \psi_{b} = b\psi_{b}
$$
0!!!

6.  The positions question

Free Response Section 

1. a 
Dont forget to normalize. 
	Drink your ovaltine

In terms of a and constants

1. b 
$$
\left< q \right>  = \frac{\int \psi^{*} q_{op} \psi \, dv}{\int \psi^{*} \psi \, dv } 
$$
$$
dv_{sphere} = r^{2}\sin\theta dr d\theta d\phi
$$

2. a
The general form of the wavefunction...

$$
K_1 = E - V_1, K_2 = E
$$
$$
k_{1} = \sqrt{ \frac{2m}{\hbar^{2}}K_{1} }
$$
$$
k_{2} = \sqrt{ \frac{2m}{\hbar }K_{2} }
$$
2. b
Continuity and smoothity relationships at the boundary 


3. calculate a commutator

4. What is the energy $E_{r}$ of a transmitted positron 

The transmitted energy for a positron is equal to the incident energy

There is current inside the barrier. Its gonna be the quantum tunneling thing. 

You need the relation here.
