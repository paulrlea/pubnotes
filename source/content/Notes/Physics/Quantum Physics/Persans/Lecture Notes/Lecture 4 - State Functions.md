Q. Whats the difference between photoelectric effect and Compton scattering?
A. Kinetic Energy transferred between photon and another material is photoelectric effect. Compton scattering demonstrates momentum.

### Complex math tricks n tips
- Use exp. notation to find square root

### Important results so far
- Copenhagen philosophy of quantum physics
	- Measure probability many many times, and look at the statistics of the results
	- The probability density relates to wave functions
	- The expectation value is a poor way to put it. It is the average
		- The measurement of observable q is solved with the integral of the wave function conjugate q and the wave function
	- The uncertainty of the measurement is aka the standard deviation which is calculated from the probability density
- We can construct any function we like out of traveling waves, with a well-defined wave vector and wavelength and momentum
- How "much" of each wave you want to add in?
### Conservation of probability
