	- Differential equations section is good
	- Can use it during exams
## Complex Numbers
A complex number can be represented by the following
$$
\tilde{z} = a + jb
$$
Using Euler's equation you can represent a complex number as 
$$
r(\cos\theta + j\sin\theta) = r e ^{j\theta}
$$
with 
$$
r = \sqrt{ \vec{r} \cdot \vec{r} } = \sqrt{ x^{2}+y^{2} }
$$
$$
\theta = \arctan \frac{c+d}{a+b}
$$
$$
\tilde{z} = r e ^{i\theta}
$$

Complex cosine function 
$$
\cos z = \frac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2}
$$
Complex sine function
$$
\sin z = \frac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2i}
$$
