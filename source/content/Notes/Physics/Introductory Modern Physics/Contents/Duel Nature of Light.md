## Light Waves

- Light is an electromagnetic wave with electric and magnetic fields propagating at speed:
  $$
  c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}
  $$
  where:
  $$
  \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{N \cdot m^2}, \quad
  \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \frac{T \cdot m}{A}
  $$
- Wave equations:
  $$
  E(x,t) = E_0 \sin(kx - vt), \quad B(x,t) = B_0 \sin(kx - vt)
  $$
  with $B_0 = \frac{E_0}{c}$ and $E$ and $B$ being perpendicular. You will learn more about this in [[Introductory Electromagnetic Theory]]

## Light Intensity

- **Definition**:
  $$
  I = \frac{P}{A}
  $$
- **Electromagnetic wave intensity**:
  $$
  I = \frac{E_0^2}{2 \mu_0 c} \quad \text{(W/m}^2\text{)}
  $$
- **Interference of two equal beams with phase difference \( \Delta \phi \)**:
  $$
  I_T = 4I_1 \cos^2 \left( \frac{\Delta \phi}{2} \right)
  $$

- **Intensity split at mirrors**:
  $$
  I_1 = I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2}, \quad I_{1d} = \frac{I_0}{4}
  $$
- **Final intensity at detector**:
  $$
  I_{\text{detector}} = I_0 \cos^2 \left(\frac{\Delta \phi}{2}\right)
  $$
- **Phase difference**:
  $$
  \Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} 2(L_1 - L_2)
  $$

- **Light passes through two slits and interferes on a screen.**
- **Path difference determines phase difference and interference pattern.**

## Two-Slit Interference: Arithmetic

- **Constructive interference**:
  $$
  \Delta L = d \sin \theta_m = m \lambda
  $$
- **Destructive interference**:
  $$
  \Delta L = d \sin \theta_m = (m + \frac{1}{2}) \lambda
  $$
- **Phase difference**:
  $$
  \Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta L
  $$

## Light: Wave or Particle?

- Light is unique because:
  - It is the fastest carrier of information.
  - It consists of massless particles carrying energy and momentum.
  - It interacts directly with our senses.
  - It has wave-like and particle-like properties.

## Interference and Diffraction Effects

- **Examples**:
  - Soap bubble colors
  - Opalescence (e.g., opals)
  - Butterfly wing coloration
  - Laser speckle patterns
  - Halo around the sun or moon
- **Applications**:
  - Holography
  - Film thickness measurement
  - High-precision spectroscopy

## Thin Film Interference

- **Interference from reflections in thin films causes color patterns.**
- **Observed as fringes when using monochromatic light.**
- **Observed as color bands with white light.**

---

## The Photoelectric Effect

- **Observation**:
  - Light ejects electrons from a metal surface.
  - The energy of ejected electrons depends on light frequency, not intensity.
  - No measurable time delay for electron ejection.

- **Photoelectric equation**:
  $$
  K_{\text{max}} = h f - \Phi
  $$
  where:
  - \( h \) is Planck’s constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \) J·s),
  - \( f \) is the frequency of light,
  - \( \Phi \) is the work function of the material.

- **Stopping potential**:
  $$
  K_C + eV_{\text{AC}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad K_C = eV_0
  $$

---

## Einstein’s Photon Hypothesis

- Light consists of **quanta** or **photons**.
- Each photon has energy:
  $$
  E = h f
  $$
- The concept helped explain the photoelectric effect and led to **quantum mechanics**.
