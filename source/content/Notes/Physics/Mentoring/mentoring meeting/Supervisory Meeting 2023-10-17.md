# Session Reports-
### Eric
Session went well. Had to take selfie in TA/office hour.
plagiarized Kerrigans board work /j. Confusion on Electron weak force,
but was able to overview. Not a ton going on. Apparently missing a 
student. Hit him with a 0. 
### Sidhi 
New student Ava joined. Room change. Light week. Bryan Levin has
come up in WIP, seems like has a track record for being creepy. Check in
with Isabella R. 
### Kerrigan
One absence. Really smart kid, Relativity dude. Madeline 
did not show up to mentoring. She is double enrolled in Phys-1200 and IMP.
### Paul
Marked E.V with a 0 due to being a knob and late. Session went well,
shorter then usual due to short lecture. Bryan Levin is being watched. 	

# New business-
Stuff to go over tomorrow: 
	-Quantum Physics 
		-Quantum Physics 1 is now just Quantum Physics. Being taught by Persans

		-Quantum Physics 2 does not exist anymore, renamed to Applications of 
		Quantum Physics. Not official yet.
	- Have a discussion with the students about their goals for the semester.
		- Academic (not GPA)
