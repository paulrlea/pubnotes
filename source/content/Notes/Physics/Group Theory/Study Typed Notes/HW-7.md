The 3 H nucleus (a pnn bound state) and the 3 He nucleus (a ppn bound state) are known to form an isospin 1 2 doublet. Use isospin to predict the ratio of the cross sections for p + d →3H + π+ and p + d →3He + π0

Process 1: 
$$
P + D \to H^{3} + \pi^{+}
$$
Process 2: 
$$
P + D \to He^{3} + \pi_{0}
$$
The magic equation: (there is another)
$$
\ket{j= l +\frac{1}{2}, m} = \sqrt{ \frac{l + m + \frac{1}{2}}{2l+ 1} }\ket{m-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}}+ \sqrt{ \frac{l-m+\frac{1}{2}}{2l+1} } \ket{m+\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}} 
$$

$$
H^{3} = PNN = DN = -\frac{1}{2}
$$
$$
He^{3} = PPN = PD = \frac{1}{2}
$$
Using the above relations: 
$$
\ket{H^{3} + \pi^{+}} \equiv \ket{1,- \frac{1}{2}}, \ \ \ket{He^{3}, \pi^{0}}  \equiv \ket{0, \frac{1}{2}}   
$$
These are the possible states from this reaction

Starting with the result of the interaction. 
$$
\frac{1}{2} \otimes 1 = \frac{3}{2} \oplus \frac{1}{2}
$$
The dimensions of this: 
$$
2 \times3 = 4 + 2
$$
We get this relation from the starting state with the total projection of the isospin for the H3 or He3 and the total isospin of the pion. 

There will be 6 total states, corresponding to the 6 dimensions above.
