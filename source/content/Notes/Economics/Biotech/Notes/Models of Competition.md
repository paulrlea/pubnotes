## Defining a market: 
- Define a market by thinking of the relevant constraints and regions for each company.
- Also consider highly differentiated products: i.e Ferrari and Hyundai

## Cross price Elasticity:
- The cross-price of elasticity of demand (CPE)
- Two products: x and y
$$
\epsilon^{D}_{Q(y), P(x)} = 
\frac{\text{precentage change in quantity demanded of y}}{\text{ Precentage change in price of x}}

$$

$$
\epsilon^{D}_{Q(y),P(x)} \begin{cases}
>0 \text{: subsitutes} \\
=0 \text{: unrelated} \\
<0 \text{: complements}
\end{cases}
$$
