## Initial projections for Hep C patients

>"An estimated three million to four million Americans — and as many as 170 million people worldwide — have chronic infections of hepatitis C. Many of those infected in the United States are baby boomers who injected drugs using contaminated needles decades ago and might not even know they have the disease. The infection can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, but often not for decades"

As of 2011
