Mutually exclusive potential results of a potential process. I.E. Grade on exam, days of snow next week. 

> Random Variable

Numerical summary of a random outcome. 

Discrete vs Continuous. 

Each outcome of a discrete random variable occurs with a certain probability. 

Probability is always non-negative

## Cumulative Probability Distribution 

The probability that random variable is less then or equal to a particular value. 

!! **The probability of a continuous variable being a discrete value is 0**

Instead, it is defined as a Probability Distribution Function (PDF)

$$
P(S\leq s) = P(S<S)
$$
## Bernoulli Random Variable
Has two outcomes, 1 or 0.
Probability (and mean) p is probability of B=1
Standard deviation is given by 
$$
\sigma_{B} = \sqrt{ p(1-p) } 
$$
## Skewness
$$
\text{Skewness} = E\left( \frac{y-\mu_{y}}{\sigma_{y}} \right)^{2}
$$Skewness is unit free

## Kurtosis

How "sharp" is the peak, and how wide are the tails

Given by 
$$
\text{Kurtosis} = \frac{E[(y-\mu_{y})^{4}]}{\sigma_{y}^{4}}
$$

## Conditional Probability

$$
E(y) = E[E(Y|X)]
$$
## Independence 
Implies mean independence
Mean independence does not imply independence

## Covariance

The covariance of x and y measures the linear relation to which x and y move together.
