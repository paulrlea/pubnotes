# Measuring the amount of protection
- The [[Effective Rate of Protection]] calculates the percentage change in value added as a result of using tariffs. 
- The tariff rate is different then the [[Effective Rate of Protection]], because not only the tariff industry is effected but other industries. The [[Effective Rate of Protection]] is typically higher then the tariff rates. 
	- Ex- in a theoretical market, automobiles sell for 8000, made of factors that cost 6000. Value added is 2000 from prod. process. 
	- If tariff is 25%, then car companies can charge up to 10000 instead of 8000. This leads to a value added of 4000 instead of 2000. The precentage change of value added is going to be +100%
- Formula give by $$
\frac{\Delta Value \ added}{old \ value} = \%\ increase
$$
- The revenue from tariffs is collected and goes to the government, benefiting them. 
# Consumer and Producer surplus

- Consumer surplus calculates the amount of benefit measures the amount that they are paying vs the max amount that they are willing to pay. As tariffs go up, consumer surplus goes down and consumers are worse off.

- Geometry of consumer surplus: Consumer surplus is equal to area under the demand curve and above price.
## Producer Surplus
- We are calculating the benefits that the producer are receiving from selling the good at their price vs the minimum price. 
- The producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and under the price. 
- Calculating the change in producer surplus just see change in area between supply and price lines .

## Tariff Effects 
- Producers benefit, consumer suffer.
- Government profit
- Formula given by $$
 tQ_{T} = (P_{T}-P_{T}^*)(D_{2}-S_{2})
$$
- This is for important country
- World prices should be lower then importing prices.

Change in welfare due to tariff is e-(b+d)
- Calculating change in producer and consumer surplus: 
- Area B and D are efficiency loss as result of change in domestic prices
- Area E represents terms of trade gain. 
- Changing prices mean consumers consume less with higher prices and producers produce more. 
- If you look at government revenue, it is divided over two areas. Terms of trade gain, gain at soct of forigners and area C, which is part of consumer loss. The govermen gains at cost of foreigners and consumers. 
- The gap between areas B and D and E determines if a tariff is worth it in terms of welfare. 
- Smaller countries get worse off with tariffs because exporters just wont ship their goods to them. 
## Other costs of Tariffs
- Tariffs can lead to retaliatory trading practices. 
- Tariffs can be hard to remove, and large tariffs may cause producers to go through loopholes to avoid paying tariffs. 
- Example: 
	- Ford and Subaru install and remove seats in vans and pickup trucks to get around light commercial truck tariffs.

- this dude definitely watches "not just bikes" on yt
- Electrical grids and power generation. They cant handle electric cars, yada yada yada.
- Solar panels are hard to make, China makes all of them and people don't like that because China sucks. 
- Carbon capture is BS, Oil industries are really big etc etc.
