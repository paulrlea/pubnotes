## Question 1. 
Assume a firm has monopoly at home and foreign
a. 
Marginal revenue is twice as steep as demand. We are looking for profit maximizing quantities. 

Find where Marginal Revenue = Marginal cost

In a perfectly competitive market Price=Marginal Cost, then we can determine prices. 

Find marginal revenue equation, marginal revenue is twice as steep as demand. 
$$
P = $100 - 0.5Q
$$
So therefore marginal revenue would be 
$$
MR = 100-Q
$$
Where marginal cost is 10. Q is 90 b/c
$$
MR = MC  = 100-Q= 10
$$
Plugging back into price:
$$
P = 100-0.5(90) \to P = 55
$$
For foreign: 
$$
P = $100  \dots
$$


b. Assume firms fixed cost is 4000 million. To find variable costs, $MC \times Q$. Also, $Total\ cost = FC + VC$. 
$$
TC = 4000 + MC \times Q 
$$
$$
TC = 4000 + 10(90) + 14(180) = 7420
$$To find profit: ($\pi$)
$$
\pi = 55(90) + 32(180) -7240 = 3290

## Question 3. 
a. 
- Come up with supply and demand
- Set equal to each other
- Slope is 1/30 million
- Finding Intercept 
$$
200=a_{0} + 20(60) \implies a_{0}=-700
$$
$$
3500 = a_{0} -30(60)
$$

$$
D = 5300 -30P
$$
$$
S = -700 + 20P
$$
Equilibrium: 
$$
S = D =  2300-30P = -700+20P
$$
$$
P = 120, Q = 1700
$$
b. Draw supply and demand diagram. 
show intercepts, equilibrium and quantity
$$
S = 0 _\implies 20P=700 \implies P = 35
$$
$$
D = 0 \implies 30P = 5300 \implies P=176.7
$$
$$
CS = \frac{5.7\times_{1}1700}{2} = 481125
$$
$$
PS = \frac{85\times_{1}7000}{2} = 72250
$$


c. Consider free trade price of 60:

$$
CS = \frac{116.9\times3500}{2} = 204225
$$
$$
PS = \frac{2.5\times 500}{2} = 6250
$$
d. Price goes up by 10 dollars. Put back into equations derived in part A. 
$$
P_{T} = P_{W} + t = 60 + 10 = 70
$$
$$
D = 5300 - 30(70) =3200
$$
$$
S = -700 + 20(70)
$$
e. Solve for welfare effects of Tariff:

## N.B

Out of 4 questions: 
One of them is similar to last question. Related to chapter 14. Related to interest parity equation and also the difference between the numbers that we get here. One part explanation and one part calculation 

The other one is similar to 3. Effects of tariffs. Be careful when graphing if asking for changing or total CS/PS. Make sure answers are clear. Similar to question 3 and group assignment 5? 

Third question is a mix of 1 and 2. Working on finding prices and quantities comparing monopoly to perfect competition using equations and graphs. 

Fourth question is on chapter 6 and is on effect on imposing tariff and subsidy. Effects of biased growth. Important point is effect of tariff and subsidies on demand and supply curves, but in case of biased growth only supply curve shifts to come up with final effects on terms of trade.
