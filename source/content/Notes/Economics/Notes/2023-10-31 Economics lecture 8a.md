## Decreasing birth rate in japan and effect on Economy
- Background of Japanese economics
	- Feudal Japan had social classes and small trade with China and Korea 
	- Majority of population was farmers. Stayed constant through preindustrial japan 
	- Rapid development of industry in 19th-20th century.
	- Produced silk, steel, and textiles
	- in 1980's "lost decade" asset bubble occurred causing a bank run
		- Played a role in decreasing birth rate
		- Blended into the 1990's and 2000's
	- Japan has regained economy in present
		- 3rd largest economy in the world 
		- Investment in real estate, leader in electronics and mfg.
		- Norma Holdings
- Birth "Dilemma'"
	- Japan has highest elder population in the world
	- Many people value work > family
	- More people are retiring then entering the workforce
- Effects of birthrate
	- will shrink all sectors
	- less mfg workers is less output 
	- demand will increase and supply will decrease
	- infrastructure will fall apart from lack of tax revenue
	- pension and welfare system will be heavily impacted 
	- R&D will slow
- Effects of Japan decreasing population
	- Leading manufactures will slump
	- Investment and financial decisions 
	- R&D?
- Also may occur in Italy and Portugal
- Solutions: 
	- More incentives for couples to start families
	- Increase in Child care facilities and system 
	- Better work/life balance
- Japan does these things but need to do more
# Chapter 8
Chapter 8 is about internal economies of scale. [[Internal economies of scale]] are related to the cost advantages of individual firms. This results in imperfect competition due to monopolies, leading to some firms having cost advantages over other firms. This is known as a monopoly/oligopoly. It usually happens when producers are producing a differentiated good which is different then other types of goods. In this chapter we will determine prices with a simple model in a monopolistic market. In regards of determining prices, how can we determine prices in a case of imperfect competition?
- Monopoly sets price
- $P=A_{c}$ is perfect competition case 
- $Mr=Mc$ is Imperfect competition case (monopoly)

Demand curve is negatively sloped, inverse relation between prices and q. If you have Q and P you can have a negative linear relationship that depicts the relation between prices and quantity. 
Demand curve:
$$
Q=a-bP
$$
$$
bP=a-Q
$$
$$
P_{s}\leq \frac{a}{b}-\frac{1}{b}
$$
This above is the demand curve. 
Total revenue can be represented by the following: 
$$
TR=Q\times P=Q\left[ \frac{a}{b}-\frac{Q}{b} \right]= \frac{a}{b}Q-\frac{Q^{2}}{b}
$$
For marginal Revenue, you take the derivative of the above WRT Q. 
This results in 
$$
MR=\frac{dTR}{DQ} \implies MR=\frac{A}{B}-\frac{2Q}{b}
$$

We also need total cost, to get marginal cost.  

 $$
TC=fC + VC = fC + c\cdot Q
$$
Fixed Costs are $fC$. 

$$
MC=\frac{dTc}{dq}
$$
Marginal cost is a straight horizontal line
Average cost is a slightly negative slope, due to returns on investment
$$
AC=\frac{TC}{Q}=\frac{FC}{Q}+c
$$
The gap between price and average cost represents economic benefits from monopolies . 
Monopolistic Competition Model:

## Monopolistic competition model
- Assumptions
	- All firms are symmetric. This allows us to have the same demand and cost function. 
- Equation of Average cost
- Equal Shares  Q=s/n -> shows sales of whole industry, where n is number of firms. 
- Average cost is equal to fixed cost divided by 2. 
- $$
AC=\frac{FC}{Q} + c +.AC=\frac{nPC}{S}+c
$$
When there are more firms, average cost goes up. When you have fewer firms, they can utilize economies of scale to offer lower prices. 

As S goes up =>AC goes down
As N goes up, AC goes up
If there are more firms in the market, 
>If we have more firms, less sale, AC goes up..

More firms=more competition= firms need to offer lower price.

Q is sales of each firm. B is number of firms , Pbar is average firms/compe
P price sharged by firm interest.  b represents the responsiveness

as S +> 
as n goes up, Q goes down
as P goes p, Q goes down
as Pbar goes up, goes up

Price dumping: 
Unfair situation where firms sell to foreign countries for cheaper then at home. 

HW: find examples of price dumping
