# A. 
Home’s demand curve is D = 1250-50P, where D is quantity demanded and P is the competitive price. Home’s competitive supply curve is given by MC = 4 + S/100, where S is quantity-supplied. Assuming P = MC and D=S, solve for Home’s equilibrium price and quantity
$$
D = 1250 -50P
$$
$$
MC = 4 + \frac{S}{100}
$$
Plugging in MC for P we get 
$$
D = 1250-50\left( 4+\frac{D}{100} \right)
$$
And this simplifies down to 
$$
\frac{3}{2}D = 1050 
$$
$$
D = 700
$$
From this we can determine that
$$
D = 70, P =11 , MC =11, S=700
$$
Equilibrium price and quantity are going to be $11$ and $700$

# B. 
Solve P when S=0 and when D=0 in order to find the vertical intercepts, and draw the supply and demand diagram. Solve for both consumer surplus and producer surplus.
$$
D = 1250 - 50P
$$
$$
D = 0 \implies P=25
$$
$$
P=4+\frac{S}{100}
$$
$$
S=0 \implies P=4
$$

# C. 
Foreign’s demand curve is also D* = 1250-50P*, but Foreign’s supply curve is given by MC* = 1 + S*/100. Assuming P* = MC* and D*=S*, solve for Foreign’s equilibrium price and quantity. Draw the supply and demand diagram for Foreign, and solve for Foreign’s consumer surplus and producer surplus


$$
MC^* = 1 + \frac{S^*}{100}; \ \ D^* = 1250 + 50P^{*}; \ \ P^* = MC^*; \ \ S^* = D^*
$$
$$
1.5D^* = 1250-50 \implies D^*= 800 \  \& \  S^* = 800
$$
$$
MC^* = 1 + \frac{800}{100} \implies MC^* \ \& \ P^*= 9 
$$

$$
CS=\frac{1}{2} \cdot 800 \cdot (25-9) = 6400
$$
$$
PS = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 800 \cdot (9-1) =3200

# D. 
Now find the free trade equilibrium, assuming no transportation costs or tariffs, by setting P = P* and D+D* = S+S*. Solve for the free trade price, and the quantities demanded and supplied for both countries. Show your solution on your supply and demand diagrams, and solve for each country’s consumer and producer surplus. How much does the total surplus in each country rise as a result of free trade?
$$
P=P^*; \ \ \ \ \ 4+\frac{S}{100} =1+\frac{S^*}{100}=P
$$
$$
S = 100P-400; \ \ \ \ S^* = 100P-100
$$
$$
S + S^{*} = 200P -500
$$
$$
100P = 500 + \frac{S+S^{*}}{2}
$$
$$
S + S^{*} = D+D^{*} 
$$
$$
D = 1250 - 50P;  \ \ \ \ \ \ D^{*} = 1250 - 50P^{*}
$$
$$
D + D^{*} = 2500 - 100P = 200P -500
$$

$$
\frac{3000}{300} ; \ \ \ \ P=10, \ S=600, \ S^{*} = 900, \ D = D^{*} = 750
$$
$$
CS = \frac{1}{2}(25-10)750 = 5625 \ \ \ \ \ \Delta CS = 5625-4900=725
$$
$$
PS = \frac{1}{2}(10-4)600 = 1800 \ \ \ \ \ \Delta PS = 1600-2450=-650

# E. 
80 cent tariff on imports from Foreign ->  P = P*+0.80, 	D+D*=S+S*
    Solve for both P and P*, then solve for D,D*,S,S*.
    Show solution on supply demand diagrams (for both home and foreign)
