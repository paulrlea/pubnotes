# Dumping Examples
In January 2017, the International Trade Association (ITA) decided to keep the anti-dumping duty on silica fabric products from China in place. This decision was based on a study by the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission, which showed that these products from China were being sold in the United States at unfairly low prices. The ITA believed that if the tariff was removed, there was a high chance that this unfair pricing would happen again.

## Tariffs 
A [[tariff]] is a tax levied on imported goods
Types of Tariff 
- [[Fixed Tariff]]
- [[Ad Valorem Tariff]]


Using supply and demand curves to derive [[import demand]] and [[export supply]] curves:
- If the home countries consume more then produce then they have import demand, represented by gap between home demand and home supply. 
	*insert graph here for import demand*

- Notice that prices are lower after importing goods. 
- At p_1 demand goes up and supply goes down 
- Export supply curve is difference between foreign supply and demand $$
XS^* = S^* - D^*
 $$
	*insert graph for export here*
- Notice that prices are higher internationally then domestically, justifying exporting goods
- The gap between supply and demand at various price levels gives export supply

### Export supply and import demand equilibrium. 

In equilibrium, import demand = export supply
The intersection is given by q_w in the graph below

## Effects of a Tariff
- A tariff acts like a transportation cost, making sellers unwilling to ship goods unless the home price exceeds foreign price by enough to make the difference worthwhile 
- The gap, given by $P_{t}^{*}-P_{t}$ has to be equal to the tariff rate
- A tariff makes the price go up in the home market and down in the foreign market. 
- The prices in the foreign country go down because demand is lowered?
-  Tariffs are more important if the importing country is a larger share of the total market. 
	*insert effects of a tariff graph here*

- The intersection of export supply and import demand gives world price 
	- Should be below equilibrium price in home market
	- The opposite occurs in the foreign country, so its above world price.
- Adding a Tariff, the prices in the home country will increase
	- As prices go up, demand goes down and supply goes up. 
	- The gap, which explains the demand for imports, gets smaller
- Prices in foreign country go down, 
	- As prices fall, supply goes down and demand goes up 
	- The gap between $P_{t}$ and $P_{t}^{*}$ is amount of export supply for foreign country. 
TLDR: With higher prices in home from tariffs, supply goes up demand goes down gap goes down import demand goes down. Opposite in foreign with export supply goes down. Tariffs decrease quantity of trade 

### Example of effect: 
US Agricultural exports to china from 2014-2018, including soy, cotton and other agricultural goods. China imposed a big tariff on US exports, caused massive decrease in value of trade ~53%

Effects of Tariff in a small country: 
	When a country is "small", it has no effect on the world price because its an insignificant part of world demand.

	Whole tariff is paid for by home country. 
	

# Presentation 
Impact of Russo-Ukraine war on EU
- Started in Crimea Crisis and Donbas
- Minsk agreement temporarily stopped it
- Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022
- European industry effects
	- European Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) increased to 60 after COVID but fell to 45 after 2022 invasion. 
	- When the war started natural gas imports were restricted
	- Natural gas is very important for raw materials and energy. 
	- Break of Nordstream 2 limited gas trade
	- Using LNG as substitute but is more expensive
