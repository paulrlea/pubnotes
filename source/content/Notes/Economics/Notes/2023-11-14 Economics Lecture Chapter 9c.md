# Export Subsidies

- An export subsidy can also be structured like an [[Ad Valorem Tariff]], or a fixed, *specific* rate. 
- Export subsidies increase the price in the exporting country, which decreases consumer surplus and increases producer surplus. it also decreases goverment surplus
- Price for importing countries go down 
- The overall welfare for the exporting country usually goes down, as well as terms of trade.

- The above graph depicts the exporting country, where a subsidy is imposed. Government revenue goes down with an export subsidy. The net welfare goes down. 
- Inefficiency loss is depicted from b and d. This is the inefficiency caused by consumers consuming too little and producers producing too much. 
- With a tariff, there is a terms of train gain with an efficient loss, both are decreased with the export subsidy. 

### Example: European Union CAP
The European Unionâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) sets high prices for agricultural products and subsidizes exports to dispose of excess output. Subsidized exports reduce world prices of agricultural products. The cost of this policy for European taxpayers is almost $30 billion more than its benefits (in 2007).

# Import quotas
- An import quota restricts the amount of a good imported.
- This will increase the price of the good imported because quantity demanded is higher then quantity supplied. 
- The government receives no revenue, the import licence holders get the extra revenue. These are called quota rents. 
### Example of import quotas: US sugar imports 


## Voluntary Export Restraint
- Works like an import quota, but imposed by exporting country rather then importing country. Foreigners sell a restricted quantity at an increased price.
- Example being the Iranian Oil Embargo
