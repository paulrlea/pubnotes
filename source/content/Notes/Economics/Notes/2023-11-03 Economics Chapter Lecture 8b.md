# Firms in the global economy
## Monopolistic Competition Theory
- Larger firms can expand production leading to oligopoly or monopoly. 
- The level of sales for each firm is related to the size of the industry and $\bar{p}$.
- This relation is given by $$
Q=S\left[ \frac{1}{n}-b(P-\bar{P}) \right]
$$
	Where n is number of firms, Q is quantity produced, $\bar{p}$ is the price other firms are charging, p is the price that the firm itself is charging, s is the size of the industry.

- This demonstrates how different factors effect firms operating in a monopolistic market. 
## Monopolistic Market with Trade

- Because trade increases market size, trade will decrease average cost and therefore price. If we use $$
AC = n\left( \frac{F}{S} \right) + C
$$
- This shows the relation between average cost and market size. This clearly demonstrates that when S, size of economy becomes larger then AC goes down.
- Welfare for consumers is increased by trade due to more available goods, and lower prices on existing goods.

- The PP curve is related to the change in market size. The CC curve is related to the cost of production, and is positively sloped. As the number of firms is increasing, the share of each firm is smaller, which means that each firm can't take as much advantage of economies of scale.
- If we open up to trade, we will have access to a larger market. 
- This is why the CC curve gets flatter with trade, moving from point 1 to point 2. 
- This makes sense because prices will go down and the number of firms will go up. 

## Product Differentiation and Internal Economies of scale
- Different firms produce products with different characteristics. This is product differentiation. 
- Internal Economies of scale can be the driving cause of trade itself due to larger market size. 

### Example of gains from an integrated market 
Fixed cost of an automobile is F=750000000, and a marginal cost of c=5000. The total cost is given by $$
C = 750,000,000 + (5000Q)
$$
and Average cost of production is therefore given by 
$$
AC = \frac{750,000,000}{Q} + 5000
$$
If home has annual sales of 900,000 automobiles with 6 firms, and a foreign country has 8 firms with 1,600,000 automobiles sold. The average cost would be lower at home then foreign. If the market is integrated, then prices for automobiles would be lower then either price before integration.

- Notice how $6+8 \neq 10$, this is because smaller companies exit the market when trade occurs and the market increases.
- When we have integrated market after trade the average cost of production is much lower.
- The CC and PP graphs are given below

Integrated

Notice how the CC curve gets flatter when the market expands through trade. 

## Intra-Industry trade
- This concept refers to the import and export of similar goods. 
- Both trade partners benefit from 
	- A greater variety at lower prices 
	- Consolidated production and economies of scale 
- Smaller countries stand to gain more from integration then a larger countries. 
	- Smaller countries can get access to a greater variety of goods then a larger country. 
- A large percentage of world trade is intra-industry trade, around 25-50%
- Most prominent is pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and specialized machinery in the United States
### An example: North American Auto Pact of 1964
Before 1964, tariff production of Canadian auto industry led to a autonomous Canadian automotive industry. In 1964, both Canada and the United States signed the NAAP of 1964, which sharply increased Canadian automotive productivity. For each model of car, there is typically a plant in at least one of US/Mexico/Canada that sell to the entire north american market. This allows auto manufacturers to leverage economies of scale better. This was further established by NAFTA,  which allows for free trade between US/Canada/Mexico. If NAFTA was removed, then the production of cars in the US will go up, and down outside the US. 
## Firm Responses to Trade
- Trade typically hurts the worst-performing firms, because they are forced to exit. The best performing firms typically benefit. 
- Overall industry performance typically improves. 
- Trade and integration can improve the performance of an industry as much as a new technology can. 
## Trade Costs and Export Decisions 
- Most US firms do not export and goods at all. Why? A major reason is **trade costs**
- The costs of trade include transportation costs, export duties, etc. This excludes small firms from trade.
- This may be able to explain why exporters are larger and more productive. 
- On average, in the United States manufacturing industry, an exporting firm is over twice as large as a non-exporting firm. 
- Differences between exporters and non-exporters are even larger in many European countries. 
- Firms that export more include Computer/Electronics, chemicals and machinery. 
![[Pasted image 20231103152034.png]]
	- On the first graph, we have 2 firms, MC_1 and MC_2. Marginal cost is held constant to quantity. If both of these two firms want to export, they will have to consider trade costs, which will shift both lines upwards as seen in graph 2. As seen in graph 2, firm 2 will be unable to sell any units at price $c_2 + t$, this "locks out" firm 2 from exporting goods. This benefits larger firms more then smaller firms. 

## Dumping
- Dumping is charging a lower price for exported goods then goods sold domestically. 
- This is an example of price discrimination. 
- Dumping occurs when- 
	- Imperfect competition exists and firms are able to influence market prices
	- Markets are segmented and its difficult to sell goods in one market in another.
- Dumping can be considered a "profit maximizing" strategy. 
- An exporting firm will respond to the trade cost by lowering markups on exported goods. This allows them to sell more goods, and thus maximize profit. 
- How can one protect domestic firms from dumping? 
	- Commerce Department can impose an anti-dumping tax to protect the US firm. 
	- Tax is equal to difference between actual and "fair" price of imports. 
	- The ITC(International Trade Commission) can determine if injury has occurred, then the anti-dumping duty remains. 
- Developing countries such as china have been subject to especially heavy anti dumping taxes.
