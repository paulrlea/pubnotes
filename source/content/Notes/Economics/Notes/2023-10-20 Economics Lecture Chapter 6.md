## Relative Prices and Demand- 
Affected by prices and tastes using the [[Indifference curve]]
![[Pasted image 20231020141003.png]]
The tangent of the [[isovalue line]] on the indifference curve is the consumption point

Example: an increase in the relative price of cloth $\frac{Pc}{P_{f}}$ causes consumption choice to shift upwards. 
This causes the consumption choice to shift upwards. 
An economy that exports cloth is better off when the relative price of cloth rises

## Effects of rise in relative prices and gains from trade 
![[Pasted image 20231020141251.png]]
The relative supply is determined by Q1 on the relative supply curve, and D1 is shown by 1'. The gap between 1' and 1 determines export quantity. As trade happens, the gap increases and firms are encouraged to export more. 
More trade enables a higher consumption point to be reached. 
In the above diagram, there is no trade at point 3. 

## Trade effects on distribution of income
- High income families vs low income families. In low income families, most income goes to mfg goods, while in high income families spend on services. 
- Expanding this to free trade market, this will lead to unequal gains from trade. 
- On average, for 40 countries, the estimated gains from trade are 35% higher for the 10th percentile then the 90th percentile. 

In summary, poor consumers benefit from trade more, partially due to [[terms of trade]]. 

What about for manufactured goods?
- price of manufactured goods has decreased in past two decades due to globalization, and developed countries advantage has decreased over time. 

# Chapter 6 b
Summary: Effects of growth, tariffs and export subsidies on trade patterns and welfare. 

Key Questions: 

Is economic growth in China good for standard of living in the U.S from the standard model? 

Growth is usually biased within a country, one industry grows more then another. Example of this is USF textiles vs electronic industries. Growth is biased towards electronic industry. 

Effects of biased growth: 
Demonstrable using a shift in PPF: 
![[Pasted image 20231020142528.png]]

If growth is biased towards cloth, then relative quantity of cloth increases. $qc/qf$ increases, and vice versa for food. 

Biased growth effects the supply curve. **Not demand curve**

[[biased growth ]] causes a change in [[relative supply]] and therefore a change in [[terms of trade]] 
![[Pasted image 20231020142849.png]]

$Pc/Pf$ is terms of trade for the home country. 

If the US exports computer goods to Mexico, then our terms of trade decrease. 

Import vs Export biased growth: 
Export biased: Growth that expands a countries PPF in the export sector more. 
Import based: Vice versa.

If you have export biased growth, terms of trade and welfare both go down. This is bad because the income decreases. 


If china is mostly import based, then growth in the sectors that compete with U.S exports would decrease US terms of trade and increase terms of trade for China.  China's export biased growth has created a system that decreases their terms of trade. 

In developing countries, terms of trade fluctuate based on prices of mineral and agricultural prices.

## Import tariffs and Export subsidies. 
Import tariff: taxes on imports 
Export subsidy: Money for mfg exporting

### Effect of Tariff on a good: 

Assume that US is importing textiles from mexico with a tariff. 
Step 1: see what happens to domestic relative price. 
Steps 2 and 3: see how curves shift.
Step 4: Find Terms of trade and welfare 
Makes country better off at cost of others. 
Terms of trade for US: Pc/Pt
Pc/Pt goes down, relative price goes down
Small countries dont benefit for tarrifs as much
![[Pasted image 20231020144220.png]]

### For subsidies: 

EX: The US is exporting computer to mexico. This decreases domestic supply, and domestic demand doesn't change. This leads to Pc/Pt increasing. **Domestic supply will increase**, because higher prices increase supply. Domestic demand will go down, causing the supply to decrease, lowering [[terms of trade]]. Pc/Pf



### Terms of trade effects: 
Export subsidies by foreign countries on goods that: 
-the us exports decreases the terms of trade for the US
-the us imports increases the terms of trades for the US

# Presentation 
Nuclear power 
US has 18.2% electricity from Nuclear Power
Nuclear energy contributes 60 billion to yearly US GDP 
LCOE: Levelized cost of electricity
Nuclear Power: High input costs/low operating costs
OECD: Organisation for economic cooperation and development.
Nuclear Energy has highest line?
Overnight costs make up the financing of the construction of a plant. 
Rose from 1900/kWe to 3580/kWe. across OECD
US  rose more
Operating costs: 
cost of fuel doesn't have much effect on operating costs
Global uranium trade
China and India are doing uranium vertical integration
Global reactor trade
Nuclear power is projected to grow due to new technology and growth in developing countries.
