# Cases for and against free trade
## For Free Trade
Efficiency gains from free trade, loss from tariffs.
Production and consumption distortion. 
However, Tariffs are usually small enough to be insignificant. 

Less developed countries will benefit more from free trade. 

More competition spurs development and entrepreneurship. 

Avoids loss of resources through [[Rent Seeking]] (think quotas and licencing)

Political Argument for free trade: 
	Free trade is the best physical political policy. 

Cases against free trade: 

For a large country, a tariff lowers prices

A high tariff rate blocks imports and leaves a country worse off, while an "optimal" tariff would maximize national welfare. 

Export tax (negative export subsidy) that prohibits exports leaves a country worse off, but an export tax that maximizes national welfare exists through terms of trade gains. 

Domestic market failures may exist that cause free trade to be a sub-optimal policy. When you calculate consumer and producer surplus with ideal situation it may not be accurate. 

Market Failure Symptoms: 
- Persistent underemployment of workers
- High under utilization of capital
- Property rights not well defined. 
Types of market failures
- Tech
- Environmental 
Marginal social benefit 
- Additional benefit to country from private production 
- With a market failure, marginal social benefit is not correlated with producer surplus so efficiency loss calculations are misleading

Theory of second best- 
Government intervention that distorts market incentives in one market by offsetting market failure elsewhere. 

Protected Sectors: 
Agriculture
Clothing/Textiles

Exporting valuable goods: 
Many underdeveloped countries have large amounts of valuable goods
They are getting shafted from multinational countries exploiting them. 
Trade mispricing (illegal transfer of money) is enabling this. 
Can be used to shift profit and loss. 
Trade mispricing can be used to claim tax incentives and to launder money
60 billion dollars from 5 African countries
African countries are vulnerable to this because they don't have the resources to enforce it
UNCATD projects that lost revenue leads to higher mortality rate.
Ways to prevent: 
Smart shipping containers
Global forum on transparency for tax purposes
