An indifference curve represents combinations of two goods that leave the customer equally well off. 
Negatively sloped, meaning if consumption of one good falls, consumption of the other good has to increase to maintain satisfaction. 
The slope increases as you go to the right.
As you move to the right, and add consumption of one good, the good becomes less valuable due to diminishing returns.
