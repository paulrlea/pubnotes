A fixed Tariff is a flat tax applied to imports. More often used for low-value goods that don't change in prices much. 

A fixed tariff, also known as a specific tariff, is a type of import tax that is levied as a fixed amount of money per unit of a particular imported good. Unlike ad valorem tariffs, which are based on a percentage of the value of the imported goods, fixed tariffs are set amounts regardless of the price or value of the goods.

Here's how a fixed tariff works:

1. **Fixed Amount Per Unit**: With a fixed tariff, the government specifies a set amount of money that must be paid for each unit of the imported good. For example, if a country imposes a fixed tariff of $10 per unit on a certain type of imported widget, then every widget of that type entering the country will incur a $10 tax.

2. **Independent of Price**: Unlike ad valorem tariffs, which can vary depending on the value of the goods, fixed tariffs do not change with fluctuations in the price of the imported item. This means that the tax remains the same regardless of whether the goods are expensive or inexpensive.

Applications of Fixed Tariffs:

1. **Revenue Generation**: Like ad valorem tariffs, one of the primary purposes of fixed tariffs is to generate revenue for the government. This revenue can be used to fund various public services and infrastructure projects.

2. **Protecting Domestic Industries**: Fixed tariffs can be used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. By imposing a specific tax on imports, the government can increase the price of foreign goods, making domestically-produced alternatives more competitive.

3. **Predictability**: Fixed tariffs provide a higher level of predictability for both importers and exporters. Since the tax is a set amount per unit, it's easier for businesses to plan and budget for their import activities.

4. **Addressing Market Failures**: In some cases, fixed tariffs may be used to correct market failures. For example, they can be used to address issues like negative externalities (e.g., pollution caused by certain imports) or to discourage the consumption of certain goods (e.g., high-sugar products).

5. **Simplicity and Transparency**: Fixed tariffs are relatively straightforward to administer and understand compared to ad valorem tariffs, which can be more complex due to their dependence on the value of the goods.

However, it's worth noting that fixed tariffs can also face criticisms. They may not always be as effective in adjusting to changing economic conditions or in addressing issues related to unfair trade practices. Additionally, they can sometimes lead to distortions in resource allocation and market inefficiencies. As with any trade policy, careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks is important.
