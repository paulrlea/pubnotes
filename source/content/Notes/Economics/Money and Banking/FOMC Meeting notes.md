## Monetary Policy
over past 2 years 
- Raised policy rate by 5 1/4 percent
- Decreased securities holdings 1.3 trillion 
Restrictive stance on monetary policy puts downward pressure on inflation 
Maintain fed funds at 5 1/4 to 5 1/2 %
The monetary policy is at peak tightness 
Dialing back monetary policy this year?
	Uncertain, economic outlook uncertain. Prepared to keep fed funds if needed

Reducing policy rates too soon could cause tighter policy later on. Too little/late could unduly stifle the economy. Need more confidence that inflation is going down. 

Restoring price stability is essential to employment and stability
