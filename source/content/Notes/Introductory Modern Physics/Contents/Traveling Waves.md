# Waves, but moving
Now that we have mastered the domain of waves that do not move, lets look at the ones that do. This will consist of the real stuff, like light waves, gravitational waves, and ocean waves. (We'll put that quantum harmonic oscillator in the back of our minds until we learn about [[standing waves]]) 

Armed with the knowledge from stationary waves, we can write a multi-varied function for traveling waves as follows: 
$$
y(x,t) =  y_{m} \sin\left( \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} x-\frac{2\pi}{T}t +\phi \right) = y_{m}\sin \left[ \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\left( x-\frac{\lambda}{T}t \right)+\phi \right]
$$
This is a long equation, but pretty simple at heart. The displacement of the wave at a time $t$ and a place $x$ is given by the right hand side. The amplitude here is $y_{m}$
