- Moving electrons radiate electromagnetic fields 
	- Oscillating Electric Dipole example
- Radiation problem's take the form of an inhomogenous wave equation
- Relation between electric and magnetic fields and potentials
$$
\vec{E} = - \vec{\nabla} V  - \frac{ \partial \vec{A} }{ \partial t } 
$$
$$
\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A}
$$
- Solutions to inhomogenous wave equation are retarded potentials
- Using approximations from retarded potential to find electric and magnetic potential
- Using potentials we can calculate fields. Radiation fields typically take the form of spherical waves. At large distances appears to be plane waves. 
- From this, we calculate the poynting vector and then we can integrate to find power.


# Liénard-Wiechert potentials

## Usage
- Accelerated electrons are often used to produce electromagnetic radiation
- A commonly used example is microwave ovens
- Often used for research in accelerators, with both electrons and protons. 
- Accelerating electrically charged particles circularly can create a source of EM radiation 

## Deriving Electric field 
$$
\vec{E} (\vec{r},t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{\mathscr{r}}{(\mathscr{r}\cdot \vec{\vec{u}})^{3}} [ (c^{2}-v^{2} )\vec{u} + \mathscr{r} \times (\vec{u} \times \vec{a})]
$$
where $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration, $\vec{u}$ is the velocity of the charge and $\vec{r}$ is the vector to the field point 

The electric field lines become distorted as the electron speed approaches light speed ($c$). The Coulomb field begins to concentrate perpendicular to the direction of motion.
