- Generalizing [[@Spring2024/Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Electrostatics/Electric Field]] to a continuous distribution over a region
$$
\mathbf{E(r)}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\int \frac{1}{r^{2}}dq 
$$
- Common forms include line charges, surfaces charges, and volume charges
- Volume charge distribution is also sometimes referred to using [[Coulomb's Law]]
$$
\mathbf{E(r)} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \int\frac{\rho(\mathbf{r^{\prime}})}{r^{2}}\hat{r} \, d\tau^{\prime} 
$$
