- The integral around a closed path is zero
$$
\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d \mathbf{l} = 0
$$

- Applying Stoke's theorem 
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0
$$
- These two equations hold true for any static charge distribution whatever.  
- This is an easy way to check to see if an electric field is static
