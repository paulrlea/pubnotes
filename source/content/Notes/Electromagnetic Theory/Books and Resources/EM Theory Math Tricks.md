This is a short overview of useful mathematical relationships and concepts in EM theory

[[Divergence Theorem]]

[[@Spring2024/Physics/Math Background/Kronecker delta]]

Very useful gradient relation
$$
\frac{\vec{r} - \vec{r} ^{\prime}}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{^{prime}}|} = -\nabla
$$

DELTA FUNCTION 
The divergence of this is 
0 for all values where x $\neq$ 0
$\infty$ for x=0
$$
\frac{dF}{dx} =0 
$$
because the slope has no slope
Aka Derivative of step function
