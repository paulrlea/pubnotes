- Be able to explain all equations in equation booklet.
	- Variables, where to use them, constraints
- **Exam content will be more similar to problem sheets then tutorial problems**
- May be crossovers between different parts (Ferroelectrics/Perovskites, etc )
- There will be three questions, each one will have a main theme
	- OSC
	- Ferroelectrics
	- Nanomaterials
	- Laundau 
- Take a look at tutorial sheets again 

## Mock Exam Review
- Structure should be same as previous exam
- One of the question isn't involved (liquid crystals)
- **Ratio of triplet/singlets (25%) seems likely to be on test**
- The content may be different, but marking scheme should be similar
- Graph analysis?
	- Characterisitc curves of different devices
	- Photoelectric cells?
# Tips
- Time it properly, practice your timing 
- Make sure that you use the correct terms and jargon
	- Dirac cone, Pauli blocking, etc etc

Bonus tips
- **This is first year with perovskites and quantum dots. So there will be question on perovskites and quantum dots**
- Good examples in tutorial sheets and problem sheets 
- 3d and 2d perovskites
- ion intermixing 
- bandgap tuning
- **2d perovskites** 
	- Mix 2 topics, nano-materials and perovskites
	- Calculate band shift in perovskites 
	- **Analyze property shift between 2d and 3d**
- **Easily expect question on OSC. At least 1 questions**
	- May be questions on specific devices
	- Advantage/Disadvantage
	- Explain how structure/composition effects properties 
	- twist of backbone, alkyl chains
	- knowing the different architectures
	- **OFETS**
	- Sketch them, name components 
	- Name differences and what they are good for 
	- Analyze graphs, extract efficiencies and etc
- What kind of semiconductor? p type, n type
- Differentiate between linear and saturation regimes 
- Approximating mobility in linear and saturation regimes
- What actually happens in real device? "Is this reasonable" type questions

Nanomaterials
- different confinements
- Quantum dots absorption reflection
- being able to calculate quantum dot size
