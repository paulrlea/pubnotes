#  Physics @ RPI 
## [[Introductory Modern Physics]]:
Introductory concepts in oscillations, waves, the nature of light. Discusses Special relativity and its consequences. 

> This page is a WIP
## [[Introductory Classical Mechanics]]
Your bog-standard course in classical mechanics. Force, energy, and mechanics of motion. Rotational motion, mechanical waves and a touch of thermodynamics at the end. 

> This page does not exist yet
## [[Introductory Electromagnetic Theory]]
Your second bog standard course, in electromagnetic theory. Maxwell's laws in integral form, circuits, and the wave nature of light. 

> This page is a WIP
## [[Theoretical Mechanics]]:
Builds Directly off [[Introductory Classical Mechanics]]. The first 4000 level physics class you'll likely take, and it feels like it. Mathematically rigorous, expands on concepts learned in ICD. Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics, Non-intertial reference frames. This is one of the harder classes in my opinion.

## [[Quantum Physics 1]]:
Sort of builds off of introductory modern physics, but not quite. Fun quantum phenomena, directly covers chapters 1-6 in John S. Townsend's book: Quantum Physics: A Fundamental Approach to Modern Physics. Topics include solutions to Schrodinger's equation, different types of potential wells, and principles of quantum mechanics.

## [[Electromagnetic Theory]]:
Builds Directly off [[Introductory Electromagnetic Theory]]. Rigorous, and in depth analysis of electromagnetic theory. Electrostatics with the differential form of Maxwell's laws are introduced, and Electrodynamics are introduced. A beautiful derivation of the speed of light from Maxwell's laws is in here too.

## Experimental Physics:
This class is painful. There are no notes I can really provide on this class. You just have to get through it. Try and learn python if you can, especially matplotlib and numpy. You will spend many, many, many hours on this class. 

## Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics:
I will not be able to provide a good set of notes or overview for this course, because most of what I did was with Dr Korniss, not Dr. Terrones, and thus the content was differently geared. 


> After you have taken all of the classes above, you should have a good think on what you enjoy. At this point, you have taken all the prerequisite physics classes for an applied physics degree, and almost all the courses for a regular physics degree (sans Introductory Quantum Mechanics). At this point, you have a deep knowledge of most topics of physics, and should be able to find a specific field of physics that you enjoy, or realize that physics is terrible and you should shift your focus elsewhere. Best of luck either way. 

## Group Theory and Physics: 
This is Prof. Georg's summer special interest course on group theory, and it's applications to physics. Extremely challenging, extremely enlightening once you understand. Highly recommend, 10/10.
