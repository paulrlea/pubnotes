# Welcome 

Hello and welcome to my website! Here I hope to provide accessible and approachable notes on big physics topics, correlating with the physics curriculum taught at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute. See [[Physics Hub]] for more. Additionally, I'd like to blog and write on topics that I find interesting, keeping an online diary of sorts. See [[Blog Hub]] for more.
