# Welcome 

Hello and welcome to my website! Here I hope to provide accessible and approachable notes on big physics topics, correlating with the physics curriculum taught at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute. See [[Physics Hub]] for more. 
## About Me

Hello! My name is Paul Lea, and am currently a last-semester senior majoring in applied physics and economics at RPI, studying abroad at UCL in London. Learn more about my trips at the [[Blog Hub]]

I enjoy learning about various topics in physics, and I love to hear about new and interesting ideas. If you'd like to view my academic credentials, my resume website will be linked [here](https://www.paulsphysicsnotes.org/paulLeaResume.pdf)
